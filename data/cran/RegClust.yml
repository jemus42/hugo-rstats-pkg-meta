title: Cluster analysis via regression coefficients.
maintainer: Meredith Ray
description: This package clusters regression coefficients using the methods of clustering
  through linear regression models (CLM) (Qin and Self 2006). Maximum likelihood approach
  is used to infer the parameters for each cluster. Bayesian information criterion
  (BIC) combined with Bootstrapped maximum volume (BMV) criterion are used to determine
  the number of clusters.
