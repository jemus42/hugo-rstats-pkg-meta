title: The Conditional Probability Function of a Competing Event
maintainer: Arthur Allignol
description: Permits to estimate the conditional probability function of a competing
  event, and to fit, using the temporal process regression or the pseudo-value approach,
  a proportional-odds model to the conditional probability function (or other models
  by specifying another link function). See <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00729.x>.
