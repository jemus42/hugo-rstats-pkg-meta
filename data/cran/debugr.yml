  Debug Tool to Watch Objects/Expressions While Running an R
  Script
maintainer: Joachim Zuckarelli
description: |-
  Tool to print out the value of R objects/expressions while running
  an R script. Outputs can be made dependent on user-defined conditions/criteria.
  Debug messages only appear when a global option for debugging is set.
  This way, 'debugr' code can even remain in the debugged code for later use
  without any negative effects during normal runtime.
