title: Downloading Supplementary Data from Published Manuscripts
maintainer: William D. Pearse
description: |-
  Downloads data supplementary materials from manuscripts,
  using papers' DOIs as references. Facilitates open, reproducible
  research workflows: scientists re-analyzing published datasets can
  work with them as easily as if they were stored on their own
  computer, and others can track their analysis workflow
  painlessly. The main function suppdata() returns a (temporary)
  location on the user's computer where the file is stored, making
  it simple to use suppdata() with standard functions like
  read.csv().
