title: Disciplined Convex Optimization
maintainer: Anqi Fu
description: |-
  An object-oriented modeling language for disciplined convex
  programming (DCP). It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems
  in a natural way following mathematical convention and DCP rules. The system
  analyzes the problem, verifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical form,
  and hands it off to an appropriate solver to obtain the solution.
