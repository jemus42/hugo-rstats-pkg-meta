title: Integrative Analysis of Several Related Data Matrices
maintainer: Jonatan Kallus
description: |-
  A generalization of principal component analysis for integrative
  analysis. The method finds principal components that describe single matrices
  or that are common to several matrices. The solutions are sparse. Rank of
  solutions is automatically selected using cross validation. The method is
  described in Kallus, Johansson, Nelander and JÃ¶rnsten (2019)
  <arXiv:1911.04927>.
