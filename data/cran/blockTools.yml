  Block, Assign, and Diagnose Potential Interference in Randomized
  Experiments
maintainer: Ryan T. Moore
description: Blocks units into experimental blocks, with one unit per treatment condition,
  by creating a measure of multivariate distance between all possible pairs of units.  Maximum,
  minimum, or an allowable range of differences between units on one variable can
  be set.  Randomly assign units to treatment conditions.  Diagnose potential interference
  between units assigned to different treatment conditions.  Write outputs to .tex
  and .csv files.
