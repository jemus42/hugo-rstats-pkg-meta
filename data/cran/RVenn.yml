title: Set Operations for Many Sets
maintainer: Turgut Yigit Akyol
description: |-
  Set operations for many sets. The base functions for set operations
  in R can be used for only two sets. This package uses 'purr' to find the
  union, intersection and difference of three or more sets. This package also
  provides functions for pairwise set operations among several sets. Further,
  based on 'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', a Venn diagram can be drawn for two or
  three sets. For bigger data sets, a clustered heatmap showing presence/absence
  of the elements of the sets can be drawn based on the 'pheatmap' package.
  Finally, enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether an overlap is
  statistically significant or not.
