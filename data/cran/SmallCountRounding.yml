title: Small Count Rounding of Tabular Data
maintainer: Ã˜yvind Langsrud
description: A statistical disclosure control tool to protect frequency tables in
  cases where small values are sensitive. The function PLSrounding() performs small
  count rounding of necessary inner cells so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications
  to be published (publishable cells) are rounded. This is equivalent to changing
  micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are changed. Thus, additivity
  and consistency are guaranteed. The methodology is described in Langsrud and Heldal
  (2018) <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327768398>.
