title: nose Package for R
maintainer: Sumathi R
description: |-
  The nose package consists of a collection of three
  functions for classifying sparseness in typical 2 x 2 data sets
  with at least one cell should have zero count. These functions
  are based on the three widely applied summary measures for 2 x
  2 categorical data viz, Risk Difference (RD), Relative Risk
  (RR), Odds Ratio (OR). This package helps to identify suitable
  continuity correction for zero cells when a multi centre
  analysis or a meta analysis is carried out. Further, it can be
  considered as a tool for sensitivity analysis for adding a
  continuity correction and to identify the presence of Simpson's
  paradox.
