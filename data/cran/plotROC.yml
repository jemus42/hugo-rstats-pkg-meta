title: Generate Useful ROC Curve Charts for Print and Interactive Use
maintainer: Michael C. Sachs
description: |-
  Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit
  interpretation and comparison of multiple curves. This attempts to address
  those shortcomings by providing plotting and interactive tools. Functions
  are provided to generate an interactive ROC curve plot for web use, and
  print versions. A Shiny application implementing the functions is also
  included.
