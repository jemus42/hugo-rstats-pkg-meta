  Gaussian Process Based Design and Analysis for the Active
  Subspace Method
maintainer: Nathan Wycoff
description: The active subspace method is a sensitivity analysis technique that finds
  important linear combinations of input variables for a simulator. This package provides
  functions allowing estimation of the active subspace without gradient information
  using Gaussian processes as well as sequential experimental design tools to minimize
  the amount of data required to do so. Implements Wycoff et al. (2019) <arXiv:1907.11572>.
