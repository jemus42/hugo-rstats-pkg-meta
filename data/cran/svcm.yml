title: 2d and 3d Space-Varying Coefficient Models
maintainer: Susanne Heim
description: 2d and 3d space-varying coefficient models are fitted to<U+000a>regular
  grid data using either a full B-spline tensor product<U+000a>approach or a sequential
  approximation. The latter one is<U+000a>computationally more efficient. Resolution
  increment is<U+000a>enabled.
