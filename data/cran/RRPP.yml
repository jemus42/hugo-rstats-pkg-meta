  Linear Model Evaluation with Randomized Residuals in a
  Permutation Procedure
maintainer: Michael Collyer
description: |-
  Linear model calculations are made for many random versions of data.
  Using residual randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of squares are
  calculated over many permutations to generate empirical probability distributions
  for evaluating model effects.  This packaged is described by
  Collyer & Adams (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13029>.  Additionally, coefficients, statistics, fitted values, and residuals generated over many
  permutations can be used for various procedures including pairwise tests, prediction, classification, and
  model comparison.  This package should provide most tools one could need for the analysis of
  high-dimensional data, especially in ecology and evolutionary biology, but certainly other fields, as well.
