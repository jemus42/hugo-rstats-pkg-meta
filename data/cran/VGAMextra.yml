title: Additions and Extensions of the 'VGAM' Package
maintainer: Victor Miranda
description: |-
  Extending the functionalities of the 'VGAM' package with
  additional functions and datasets. At present, 'VGAMextra'
  comprises new family functions (ffs) to estimate several time
  series models by maximum likelihood using Fisher scoring,
  unlike popular packages in CRAN relying on optim(), including
  ARMA-GARCH-like models, the Order-(p, d, q) ARIMAX model (non-
  seasonal), the Order-(p) VAR model, error correction models
  for cointegrated time series, and ARMA-structures with Student-t
  errors. For independent data, new ffs to estimate the inverse-
  Weibull, the inverse-gamma, the generalized beta of the second
  kind and the general multivariate normal distributions are
  available. In addition, 'VGAMextra' incorporates new VGLM-links
  for the mean-function, and the quantile-function (as an alternative
  to ordinary quantile modelling) of several 1-parameter distributions,
  that are compatible with the class of VGLM/VGAM family functions.
  Currently, only fixed-effects models are implemented. All functions
  are subject to change; see the NEWS for further details on the
  latest changes.
