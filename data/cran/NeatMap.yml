title: Non-clustered heatmap alternatives
maintainer: Satwik Rajaram
description: |-
  NeatMap is a package to create heatmap like plots in 2 and
  3 dimensions, without the need for cluster analysis. Like the
  heatmap, the plots created by NeatMap display both a
  dimensionally reduced representation of the data as well as the
  data itself. They are intended to be used in conjunction with
  dimensional reduction techniques such as PCA.
