  Flexible and Coherent Test/Estimation Procedure Based on
  Restricted Mean Survival Times
maintainer: Miki Horiguchi
description: Performs the procedure proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7661>.
  The method specifies a set of truncation time points tau's for calculating restricted
  mean survival times (RMST), performs testing for equality, and estimates the difference
  in RMST between two groups at the specified tau's. Multiplicity by specifying several
  tau's is taken into account in this procedure.
