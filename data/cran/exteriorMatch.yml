title: Constructs the Exterior Match from Two Matched Control Groups
maintainer: Paul R. Rosenbaum
description: If one treated group is matched to one control reservoir in two different
  ways to produce two sets of treated-control matched pairs, then the two control
  groups may be entwined, in the sense that some control individuals are in both control
  groups.  The exterior match is used to compare the two control groups.
