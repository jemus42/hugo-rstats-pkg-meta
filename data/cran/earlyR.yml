  Estimation of Transmissibility in the Early Stages of a Disease
  Outbreak
maintainer: Thibaut Jombart
description: Implements a simple, likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction
  number (R0) using a branching process with a Poisson likelihood. This model requires
  knowledge of the serial interval distribution, and dates of symptom onsets. Infectiousness
  is determined by weighting R0 by the probability mass function of the serial interval
  on the corresponding day. It is a simplified version of the model introduced by
  Cori et al. (2013) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwt133>.
