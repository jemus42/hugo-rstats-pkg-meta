title: Chandler-Bate Sandwich Loglikelihood Adjustment
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Performs adjustments of a user-supplied independence loglikelihood
  function using a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter covariance
  matrix, based on the methodology in Chandler and Bate (2007)
  <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>.  This can be used for cluster correlated data
  when interest lies in the parameters of the marginal distributions or for
  performing inferences that are robust to certain types of model
  misspecification.  Functions for profiling the adjusted loglikelihoods are
  also provided, as are functions for calculating and plotting confidence
  intervals, for single model parameters, and confidence regions, for pairs
  of model parameters.  Nested models can be compared using an adjusted
  likelihood ratio test.
