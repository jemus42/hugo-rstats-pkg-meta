title: American options pricing with Least Squares Monte Carlo method
maintainer: Mikhail A. Beketov
description: The package compiles functions for calculating prices of American put
  options with Least Squares Monte Carlo method. The option types are plain vanilla
  American put, Asian American put, and Quanto American put. The pricing algorithms
  include variance reduction techniques such as Antithetic Variates and Control Variates.
  Additional functions are given to derive "price surfaces" at different volatilities
  and strikes, create 3-D plots, quickly generate Geometric Brownian motion, and calculate
  prices of European options with Black & Scholes analytical solution.
