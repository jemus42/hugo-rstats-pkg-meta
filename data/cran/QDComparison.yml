  Modern Nonparametric Tools for Two-Sample Quantile and
  Distribution Comparisons
maintainer: David Jungreis
description: Allows practitioners to determine (i) if two univariate distributions
  (which can be continuous, discrete, or even mixed) are equal, (ii) how two distributions
  differ (shape differences, e.g., location, scale, etc.), and (iii) where two distributions
  differ (at which quantiles), all using nonparametric LP statistics. The primary
  reference is Jungreis, D. (2019, Technical Report).
