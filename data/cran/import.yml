title: An Import Mechanism for R
maintainer: Stefan Milton Bache
description: |-
  This is an alternative mechanism for importing
  objects from packages. The syntax allows for importing multiple objects
  from a package with a single command in an expressive way. The import
  package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require) and
  direct (single-object) imports. Furthermore the imported objects are not
  placed in the current environment. It is also possible to import
  objects from stand-alone .R files. For more information, refer to
  the package vignette.
