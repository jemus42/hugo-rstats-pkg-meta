title: Tools for Assessing Estimability of Linear Predictions
maintainer: Russell Lenth
description: |-
  Provides tools for determining estimability of linear functions
  of regression coefficients, and 'epredict' methods that handle
  non-estimable cases correctly. Estimability theory is discussed in
  many linear-models textbooks including Chapter 3 of Monahan, JF (2008),
  "A Primer on Linear Models", Chapman and Hall (ISBN 978-1-4200-6201-4).
