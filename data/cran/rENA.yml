description: 'ENA (Shaffer, D. W. (2017) Quantitative Ethnography. ISBN: 0578191687)
  is a method used to identify meaningful and quantifiable patterns in discourse or
  reasoning. ENA moves beyond the traditional frequency-based assessments by examining
  the structure of the co-occurrence, or connections in coded data. Moreover, compared
  to other methodological approaches, ENA has the novelty of (1) modeling whole networks
  of connections and (2) affording both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between
  different network models.   Shaffer, D.W., Collier, W., & Ruis, A.R. (2016) <doi:10.18608/jla.2016.33.3>.'
