  Optimal Stratification of Sampling Frames for Multipurpose
  Sampling Surveys
maintainer: Giulio Barcaroli
description: 'In the field of stratified sampling design, this package offers an approach
  for the determination of the best stratification of a sampling frame, the one that
  ensures the minimum sample cost under the condition to satisfy precision constraints
  in a multivariate and multidomain case. This approach is based on the use of the
  genetic algorithm: each solution (i.e. a particular partition in strata of the sampling
  frame) is considered as an individual in a population; the fitness of all individuals
  is evaluated applying the Bethel-Chromy algorithm to calculate the sampling size
  satisfying precision constraints on the target estimates. Functions in the package
  allows to: (a) analyse the obtained results of the optimisation step; (b) assign
  the new strata labels to the sampling frame; (c) select a sample from the new frame
  accordingly to the best allocation. Functions for the execution of the genetic algorithm
  are a modified version of the functions in the ''genalg'' package.'
