  for smoothing and extracting trend and cyclical components of a
  time series. The routines are commonly used in economics and
  finance, however they should also be interest to other areas.
  Currently, Christiano-Fitzgerald, Baxter-King,
  Hodrick-Prescott, Butterworth, and trigonometric regression
  filters are included in the package.
