title: Fast Structural Filtering
maintainer: Canhong Wen
description: An implementation of the fast structural filtering with L0 penalty. It
  includes an adaptive polynomial estimator by minimizing the least squares error
  with constraints on the number of breaks in their (k + 1)-st discrete derivative,
  for a chosen integer k >= 0. It also includes generalized structure sparsity constraint,
  i.e., graph trend filtering. This package is implemented via the primal dual active
  set algorithm, which formulates estimates and residuals as primal and dual variables,
  and utilizes efficient active set selection strategies based on the properties of
  the primal and dual variables.
