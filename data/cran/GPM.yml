  Gaussian Process Modeling of Multi-Response and Possibly Noisy
  Datasets
maintainer: Ramin Bostanabad
description: Provides a general and efficient tool for fitting a response surface
  to a dataset via Gaussian processes. The dataset can have multiple responses and
  be noisy (with stationary variance). The fitted GP model can predict the gradient
  as well. The package is based on the work of Bostanabad, R., Kearney, T., Tao, S.
  Y., Apley, D. W. & Chen, W. (2018) Leveraging the nugget parameter for efficient
  Gaussian process modeling. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering,
  114, 501-516.
