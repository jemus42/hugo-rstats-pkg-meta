  Package for processing downloaded MODIS Surface reflectance
  Product HDF files. Specifically, MOD09 surface reflectance product files, and
  the associated MOD03 geolocation files (for MODIS-TERRA). The package will be
  most effective if the user installs MRTSwath (MODIS Reprojection Tool for swath
  products; <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool_swath>, and
  adds the directory with the MRTSwath executable to the default R PATH by editing
  ~/.Rprofile.
