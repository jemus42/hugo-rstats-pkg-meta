description: |-
  A set of general functions that I have used in various
  projects and in other R packages. They support some miscellaneous operations
  on data frames, matrices and vectors like adding a row on a ternary (3-value)
  data.frame based on positive and negative vector-indicators, rearranging a
  list of data.frames by rownames, pruning rows or columns of a data.frame
  that contain only one specific value given by the user,
  pruning and reordering a vector according to the common elements between its
  names and elements of another given vector, finding the non-common elements
  between two vectors (outer-section),
  normalization of a vector, matrix or data.frame's numeric values in a specified range,
  pretty printing of vector names and values in an R Markdown document.
  Also included is a function that returns the statistics needed for plotting a ROC curve.
