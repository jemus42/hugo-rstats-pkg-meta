  Copula-Based Semiparametric Analysis for Time Series Data with
  Detection Limits
maintainer: Fuyuan David Li
description: |-
  Semiparametric estimation for censored time series
  with lower detection limit. The latent response is a sequence of
  stationary process with Markov property
  of order one.
  Estimation of copula parameter(COPC) and Conditional quantile estimation
  are included for five available copula functions.
  Copula selection methods based on L2 distance from empirical copula function
  are also included.
