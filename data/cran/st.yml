title: Shrinkage t Statistic and Correlation-Adjusted t-Score
maintainer: Korbinian Strimmer
description: |-
  Implements the "shrinkage t" statistic
  introduced in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007) and a shrinkage estimate
  of the "correlation-adjusted t-score" (CAT score) described in
  Zuber and Strimmer (2009).  It also offers a convenient interface
  to a number of other regularized t-statistics commonly
  employed in high-dimensional case-control studies.
