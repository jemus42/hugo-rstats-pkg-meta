title: Adaptive Management Model Manager
maintainer: Jon Katz
description: |-
  Helps enable adaptive management by codifying knowledge in the
  form of models generated from numerous analyses and data sets. Facilitates
  this process by storing all models and data sets in a single object that can
  be updated and saved, thus tracking changes in knowledge through time. A shiny
  application called AM Model Manager (modelMgr()) enables the use of these
  functions via a GUI.
