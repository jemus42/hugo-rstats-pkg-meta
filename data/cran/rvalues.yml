maintainer: Nicholas Henderson
description: |-
  A collection of functions for computing "r-values" from various
  kinds of user input such as MCMC output or a list of effect size estimates
  and associated standard errors. Given a large collection of measurement units,
  the r-value, r, of a particular unit is a reported percentile that may be
  interpreted as the smallest percentile at which the unit should be placed in the
  top r-fraction of units.
