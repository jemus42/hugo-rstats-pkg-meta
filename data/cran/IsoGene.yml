title: Order-Restricted Inference for Microarray Experiments
maintainer: Rudradev Sengupta
description: Offers framework for testing for monotonic relationship between gene
  expression and doses in a microarray experiment. Several testing procedures including
  the global likelihood-ratio test (Bartholomew, 1961), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus
  (1976), M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007) are used to test
  for the monotonic trend in gene expression with respect to doses. BH (Benjamini
  and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2004) FDR controlling procedures
  are applied to adjust the raw p-values obtained from the permutations.
