description: |-
  Gaussian process regression with an emphasis on kernels.
  Quantitative and qualitative inputs are accepted. Some
  pre-defined kernels are available, such as radial or tensor-sum
  for quantitative inputs, and compound symmetry, low rank, group
  kernel for qualitative inputs. The user can define new kernels
  and composite kernels through a formula mechanism. Useful methods
  include parameter estimation by maximum likelihood, simulation,
  prediction and leave-one-out validation.
