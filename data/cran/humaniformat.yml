maintainer: Oliver Keyes
description: |-
  Human names are complicated and nonstandard things. Humaniformat,
  which is based on Anthony Ettinger's 'humanparser' project (https://github.com/
  chovy/humanparser) provides functions for parsing human names, making a best-
  guess attempt to distinguish sub-components such as prefixes, suffixes, middle
  names and salutations.
