version: 0.4.2
title: Quick Wraps 2
maintainer: Peter DeWitt
description: |-
  A collection of (wrapper) functions the creator found useful
  for quickly placing data summaries and formatted regression results into
  '.Rnw' or '.Rmd' files. Functions for generating commonly used graphics,
  such as receiver operating curves or Bland-Altman plots, are also provided
  by 'qwraps2'.  'qwraps2' is a updated version of a package 'qwraps'. The
  original version 'qwraps' was never submitted to CRAN but can be found at
  <https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps/>. The implementation and limited scope
  of the functions within 'qwraps2' <https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2/> is
  fundamentally different from 'qwraps'.
