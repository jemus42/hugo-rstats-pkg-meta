description: |-
  'RAMAS Metapop' <https://www.ramas.com/ramas.htm#metapop> is a
  popular software package for performing spatially-explicit population
  viability analysis. It is primarily GUI-driven, but can benefit from
  integration into an R workflow, wherein model results can be subjected to
  further analysis. 'RAMAS Metapop' stores metapopulation model parameter
  settings and population dynamics simulation results in plain text files
  (.mp files). This package facilitates access, summary and visualisation of
  'RAMAS Metapop 5' outputs in order to better integrate 'RAMAS' analyses into
  an R workflow.
