title: Covariate-Adjusted Tensor Classification in High-Dimensions
maintainer: Yuqing Pan
description: 'Performs classification and variable selection on high-dimensional tensors
  (multi-dimensional arrays) after adjusting for additional covariates (scalar or
  vectors) as CATCH model in Pan, Mai and Zhang (2018) <arXiv:1805.04421>. The low-dimensional
  covariates and the high-dimensional tensors are jointly modeled to predict a categorical
  outcome in a multi-class discriminant analysis setting. The Covariate-Adjusted Tensor
  Classification in High-dimensions (CATCH) model is fitted in two steps: (1) adjust
  for the covariates within each class; and (2) penalized estimation with the adjusted
  tensor using a cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. The package can provide
  a solution path for tuning parameter in the penalized estimation step. Special case
  of the CATCH model includes linear discriminant analysis model and matrix (or tensor)
  discriminant analysis without covariates.'
