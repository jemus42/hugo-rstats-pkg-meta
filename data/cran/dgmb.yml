title: Simulating Data for PLS Mode B Structural Models
maintainer: Alba Martinez-Ruiz
description: A set of functions have been implemented to generate random data to perform
  Monte Carlo simulations on structural models with formative constructs and interaction
  and nonlinear effects (Two-Step PLS Mode B structural models). The setup of the
  true model considers a simple structure with three formative exogenous constructs
  related to one formative endogenous construct. The routines take into account the
  interaction and nonlinear effects of the exogenous constructs on the endogenous
  construct.
