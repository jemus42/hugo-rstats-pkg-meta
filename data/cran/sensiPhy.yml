title: Sensitivity Analysis for Comparative Methods
maintainer: Gustavo Paterno
description: |-
  An implementation of sensitivity analysis for phylogenetic comparative
  methods. The package is an umbrella of statistical and graphical methods that
  estimate and report different types of uncertainty in PCM:
  (i) Species Sampling uncertainty (sample size; influential species and clades).
  (ii) Phylogenetic uncertainty (different topologies and/or branch lengths).
  (iii) Data uncertainty (intraspecific variation and measurement error).
