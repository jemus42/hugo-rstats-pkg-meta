  Spatially Discrete Approximation to Log-Gaussian Cox Processes
  for Aggregated Disease Count Data
maintainer: Olatunji Johnson
description: 'Provides a computationally efficient discrete approximation to log-Gaussian
  Cox process model for spatially aggregated disease count data. It uses Monte Carlo
  Maximum Likelihood for model parameter estimation as proposed by Christensen (2004)
  <doi: 10.1198/106186004X2525> and delivers prediction of spatially discrete and
  continuous relative risk. It performs inference for static spatial and spatio-temporal
  dataset. The details of the methods are provided in Johnson et al (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8339>.'
