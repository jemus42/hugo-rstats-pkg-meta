title: Detecting Outliers in Network Meta-Analysis
maintainer: Maria Petropoulou
description: |-
  A set of functions providing the forward search algorithm for detecting outlying studies (i.e., studies with extreme findings) in network meta-analysis:
  - provides the length of the initial subset for forward search algorithm;
  - iterations of forward search algorithm;
  - basic set of studies in each step of forward search algorithm;
  - summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm;
  - outlying case diagnostics measures;
  - ranking measures;
  - heterogeneity and inconsistency measures;
  - forward plot for summary estimates and their confidence intervals;
  - forward plots for monitored measures: outlying case diagnostics measures, ranking measures, heterogeneity, and inconsistency measures.
