  Use Known Groups in High-Dimensional Data to Derive Scores for
  Plots
maintainer: John Maindonald
description: |-
  Cross-validated linear discriminant calculations determine
  the optimum number of features. Test and training scores from
  successive cross-validation steps determine, via a principal
  components calculation, a low-dimensional global space onto which test
  scores are projected, in order to plot them. Further functions are
  included that are intended for didactic use. The  package implements,
  and extends, methods described in J.H. Maindonald and C.J. Burden (2005)
