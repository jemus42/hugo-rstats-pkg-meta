title: Seeing Convergence Concepts in Action
maintainer: Pierre Lafaye De Micheaux
description: |-
  This is a pedagogical package, designed to help students understanding convergence of
  random variables. It provides a way to investigate interactively various modes of
  convergence (in probability, almost surely, in law and in mean) of a sequence of i.i.d.
  random variables. Visualisation of simulated sample paths is possible through interactive
  plots. The approach is illustrated by examples and exercises through the function
  'investigate', as described in
  Lafaye de Micheaux and Liquet (2009) <doi:10.1198/tas.2009.0032>.
  The user can study his/her own sequences of random variables.
