title: Rerun 'Magrittr' Pipelines
maintainer: Jonathan Sidi
description: |-
  Functions in a 'magrittr' pipeline are evaluated sequentially making it
  impossible to rerun them directly from the end of the pipeline, while preserving
  stochastic characteristics embedded within the pipeline. This package
  allows the user to rerun pipelines using natural 'magrittr' syntax.
