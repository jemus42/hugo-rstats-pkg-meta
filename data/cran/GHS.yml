description: Draw posterior samples to estimate the precision matrix for multivariate
  Gaussian data. Posterior means of the samples is the graphical horseshoe estimate
  by Li, Bhadra and Craig(2017) <arXiv:1707.06661>. The function uses matrix decomposition
  and variable change from the Bayesian graphical lasso by Wang(2012) <doi:10.1214/12-BA729>,
  and the variable augmentation for sampling under the horseshoe prior by Makalic
  and Schmidt(2016) <arXiv:1508.03884>. Structure of the graphical horseshoe function
  was inspired by the Bayesian graphical lasso function using blocked sampling, authored
  by Wang(2012) <doi:10.1214/12-BA729>.
