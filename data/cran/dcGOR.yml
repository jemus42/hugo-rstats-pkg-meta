title: Analysis of Ontologies and Protein Domain Annotations
maintainer: Hai Fang
description: 'There lacks a package for analysing domain-centric ontologies and annotations,
  particularly those in the dcGO database. The dcGO (http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO)
  is a comprehensive domain-centric database for annotating protein domains using
  a panel of ontologies including Gene Ontology. With the package, users are expected
  to analyse and visualise domain-centric ontologies and annotations. Supported analyses
  include but are not limited to: easy access to a wide range of ontologies and their
  domain-centric annotations; able to build customised ontologies and annotations;
  domain-based enrichment analysis and visualisation; construction of a domain (semantic
  similarity) network according to ontology annotations; significance analysis for
  estimating a contact (statistical significance) network via Random Walk with Restart;
  and high-performance parallel computing. The new functionalities are: 1) to create
  domain-centric ontologies; 2) to predict ontology terms for input protein sequences
  (precisely domain content in the form of architectures) plus to assess the predictions;
  3) to reconstruct ancestral discrete characters using maximum likelihood/parsimony.'
