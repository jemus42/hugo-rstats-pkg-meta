description: opentraj uses the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory
  Model (HYSPLIT) for computing simple air parcel trajectories. The functions in this
  package allow users to run HYSPLIT for trajectory calculations, as well as get its
  results, directly from R without using any GUI interface.
