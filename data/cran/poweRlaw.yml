title: Analysis of Heavy Tailed Distributions
maintainer: Colin Gillespie
description: |-
  An implementation of maximum likelihood estimators
  for a variety of heavy tailed distributions, including both the
  discrete and continuous power law distributions. Additionally, a
  goodness-of-fit based approach is used to estimate the lower cut-off
  for the scaling region.
