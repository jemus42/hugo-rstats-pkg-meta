title: Ensemble Boolean Model Biomarker Analysis
maintainer: John Zobolas
description: |-
  Analysis and visualization of an ensemble of boolean models for
  biomarker discovery in cancer cell networks. The package allows to easily
  import the data results of a software pipeline that predicts synergistic drug
  combinations in cancer cell lines, developed by the DrugLogics research group
  in NTNU. It has generic functions that can be used to split a boolean model
  dataset to model groups with regards to the models predictive performance (number of true
  positive predictions or Matthews correlation coefficient score) or synergy prediction based on a given set
  of observed synergies and find the average activity difference per network
  node between all group pairs. Thus, given user-specific thresholds,
  important nodes (biomarkers) can be accessed in the sense that they make the
  models predict specific synergies (synergy biomarkers) or have better
  performance in general (performance biomarkers). Lastly, if the
  boolean models have a specific equation form and differ only in their link operator,
  link operator biomarkers can also be assessed.
