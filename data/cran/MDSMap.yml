  High Density Genetic Linkage Mapping using Multidimensional
  Scaling
maintainer: Bram Boskamp
description: Estimate genetic linkage maps for markers on a single chromosome (or
  in a single linkage group) from pairwise recombination fractions or intermarker
  distances using weighted metric multidimensional scaling. The methods are suitable
  for autotetraploid as well as diploid populations. Options for assessing the fit
  to a known map are also provided. Methods are discussed in detail in Preedy and
  Hackett (2016) <doi:10.1007/s00122-016-2761-8>.
