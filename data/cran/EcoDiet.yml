title: Estimating a Diet Matrix from Biotracer and Stomach Content Data
maintainer: Pierre-Yves Hernvann
description: |-
  Biotracers and stomach content analyses are combined in a Bayesian hierarchical model
  to estimate a probabilistic topology matrix (all trophic link probabilities) and a diet matrix
  (all diet proportions).
  The package relies on the JAGS software and the 'rjags' package to run a Markov chain Monte Carlo
  approximation of the different variables.
