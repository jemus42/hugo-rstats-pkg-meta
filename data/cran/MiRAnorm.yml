title: Adaptive Normalization for miRNA Data
maintainer: Yuda Zhu
description: |-
  An adaptive normalization algorithm that selects housekeeping genes
  based on the sample level variability in the data. This is suitable for any data
  obtained from RT-qPCR assays.  A manuscript describing the method is submitted
  to Genome Biology under ``MiRA-norm: An Adaptive Method for the Normalization of MicroRNA Array Data``, Yuda Zhu et al.
