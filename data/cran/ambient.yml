title: A Generator of Multidimensional Noise
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  Generation of natural looking noise has many application within
  simulation, procedural generation, and art, to name a few. The 'ambient'
  package provides an interface to the 'FastNoise' C++ library and allows for
  efficient generation of perlin, simplex, worley, cubic, value, and white
  noise with optional pertubation in either 2, 3, or 4 (in case of simplex and
  white noise) dimensions.
