title: Simulation of Diffusion Processes
maintainer: Arsalane Chouaib Guidoum
description: It provides users with a wide range of tools to simulate, estimate, analyze,
  and visualize the dynamics of stochastic differential systems in both forms Ito
  and Stratonovich. Statistical analysis with parallel Monte Carlo and moment equations
  methods of SDE's. Enabled many searchers in different domains to use these equations
  to modeling practical problems in financial and actuarial modeling and other areas
  of application, e.g., modeling and simulate of first passage time problem in shallow
  water using the attractive center (Boukhetala K, 1996) ISBN:1-56252-342-2.
