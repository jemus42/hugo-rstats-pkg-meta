title: Calculations for All Common Subsequences
maintainer: Alan Gu
description: Implements several string comparison algorithms, including calACS (count
  all common subsequences), lenACS (calculate the lengths of all common subsequences),
  and lenLCS (calculate the length of the longest common subsequence). Some algorithms
  differentiate between the more strict definition of subsequence, where a common
  subsequence cannot be separated by any other items, from its looser counterpart,
  where a common subsequence can be interrupted by other items. This difference is
  shown in the suffix of the algorithm (-Strict vs -Loose). For example, q-w is a
  common subsequence of q-w-e-r and q-e-w-r on the looser definition, but not on the
  more strict definition. calACSLoose Algorithm from Wang, H. All common subsequences
