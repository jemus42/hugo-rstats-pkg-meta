description: |-
  Allows to provide live interpretations and explanations of statistical
  functions in R. These interpretations and explanations are shown when the explained function
  is called by the user. They can interact with the values of the explained function's actual
  results to offer relevant, meaningful insights. The interpretations and explanations
  are based on an easy-to-use XML format that allows to include R code to interact with the
  returns of the explained function.
