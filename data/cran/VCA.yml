title: Variance Component Analysis
maintainer: Andre Schuetzenmeister
description: |2-

  ANOVA and REML estimation of linear mixed models is implemented, once following
  Searle et al. (1991, ANOVA for unbalanced data), once making use of the 'lme4' package.
  The primary objective of this package is to perform a variance component analysis (VCA)
  according to CLSI EP05-A3 guideline "Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement
  Procedures" (2014). There are plotting methods for visualization of an experimental design,
  plotting random effects and residuals. For ANOVA type estimation two methods for computing
  ANOVA mean squares are implemented (SWEEP and quadratic forms). The covariance matrix of
  variance components can be derived, which is used in estimating confidence intervals. Linear
  hypotheses of fixed effects and LS means can be computed. LS means can be computed at specific
  values of covariables and with custom weighting schemes for factor variables. See ?VCA for a
  more comprehensive description of the features.
