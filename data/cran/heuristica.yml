title: Heuristics Including Take the Best and Unit-Weight Linear
maintainer: Jean Whitmore
description: |-
  Implements various heuristics like Take The Best and
  unit-weight linear, which do two-alternative choice: which of
  two objects will have a higher criterion?  Also offers functions
  to assess performance, e.g. percent correct across all row pairs
  in a data set and finding row pairs where models disagree.
  New models can be added by implementing a fit and predict function--
  see vignette.
