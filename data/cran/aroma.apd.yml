  A Probe-Level Data File Format Used by 'aroma.affymetrix'
  [deprecated]
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on this package.
  (The (in-house) APD file format was initially developed to store Affymetrix probe-level
  data, e.g. normalized CEL intensities.  Chip types can be added to APD file and
  similar to methods in the affxparser package, this package provides methods to read
  APDs organized by units (probesets).  In addition, the probe elements can be arranged
  optimally such that the elements are guaranteed to be read in order when, for instance,
  data is read unit by unit.  This speeds up the read substantially.  This package
  is supporting the Aroma framework and should not be used elsewhere.)
