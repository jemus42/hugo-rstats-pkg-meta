title: Virome Sequencing Analysis Result Browser
maintainer: David Nieuwenhuijse
description: |-
  Experiments in which highly complex virome sequencing data is generated are difficult to visualize and unpack for a person without programming experience.
  After processing of the raw sequencing data by a next generation sequencing (NGS) processing pipeline the usual output consists of contiguous sequences (contigs) in fasta format and an annotation file linking the
  contigs to a reference sequence. The virome analysis browser app imports an annotation file and a corresponding fasta file containing the annotated contigs.
  It facilitates browsing of annotations in multiple files and allows users to select and export specific annotated sequences from the associated fasta files. Various
  annotation quality thresholds can be set to filter contigs from the annotation files. Further inspection of selected contigs can be done in the form of automatic open
  reading frame (ORF) detection. Separate contigs and/or separate ORFs can be downloaded in nucleotide or amino acid format for further analysis.
