title: Tools to Manipulate and Query Semantic Data
maintainer: Carl Boettiger
description: |-
  The Resource Description Framework, or 'RDF' is a widely used
  data representation model that forms the cornerstone of the
  Semantic Web. 'RDF' represents data as a graph rather than
  the familiar data table or rectangle of relational databases.
  The 'rdflib' package provides a friendly and concise user interface
  for performing common tasks on 'RDF' data, such as reading, writing
  and converting between the various serializations of 'RDF' data,
  including 'rdfxml', 'turtle', 'nquads', 'ntriples', and 'json-ld';
  creating new 'RDF' graphs, and performing graph queries using 'SPARQL'.
  This package wraps the low level 'redland' R package which
  provides direct bindings to the 'redland' C library.  Additionally,
  the package supports the newer and more developer friendly
  'JSON-LD' format through the 'jsonld' package. The package
  interface takes inspiration from the Python 'rdflib' library.
