title: Change-Point Estimation using Shape-Restricted Splines
maintainer: Xiyue Liao
description: In a scatterplot where the response variable is Gaussian, Poisson or
  binomial, we consider the case in which the mean function is smooth with a change-point,
  which is a mode, an inflection point or a jump point. The main routine estimates
  the mean curve and the change-point as well using shape-restricted B-splines. An
  optional subroutine delivering a bootstrap confidence interval for the change-point
  is incorporated in the main routine.
