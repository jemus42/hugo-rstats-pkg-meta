title: Assertions to Check Properties of Variables
maintainer: Richard Cotton
description: |-
  A set of predicates and assertions for checking the properties of
  variables, such as length, names and attributes.  This is mainly for use by
  other package developers who want to include run-time testing features in
  their own packages.  End-users will usually want to use assertive directly.
