title: Functions to Compute Compositional Turnover Using Zeta Diversity
maintainer: Guillaume Latombe
description: |-
  Functions to compute compositional turnover using zeta-diversity,
  the number of species shared by multiple assemblages. The package includes
  functions to compute zeta-diversity for a specific number of
  assemblages and to compute zeta-diversity for a range of numbers of
  assemblages. It also includes functions to explain how zeta-diversity
  varies with distance and with differences in environmental variables
  between assemblages, using generalised linear models, linear models
  with negative constraints, generalised additive models,shape
  constrained additive models, and I-splines.
