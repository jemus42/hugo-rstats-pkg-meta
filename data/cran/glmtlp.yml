title: Truncated Lasso Regularized Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Chong Wu
description: It provides an extremely efficient procedure for fitting the entire truncated
  lasso regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial regression
  models, Poisson regression and the Cox model. The algorithm uses the difference
  of convex technique. The detail of the algorithm is described in Shen, Pan and Zhu
  (2012) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2011.645783>. The package is inherited from a popular
  R package 'glmnet' and many functions in 'glmnet' can be directly used in 'glmtlp'.
  You can learn more details by the online manual (<http://wuchong.org/glmtlp.html>).
