title: K-Means for Joint Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Christophe Genolini
description: |-
  An implementation of k-means specifically design
  to cluster joint trajectories (longitudinal data on
  several variable-trajectories).
  Like 'kml', it provides facilities to deal with missing
  value, compute several quality criterion (Calinski and Harabatz,
  Ray and Turie, Davies and Bouldin, BIC,...) and propose a graphical
  interface for choosing the 'best' number of clusters. In addition, the 3D graph
  representing the mean joint-trajectories of each cluster can be exported through
  LaTeX in a 3D dynamic rotating PDF graph.
