title: R's Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden Subpaths
maintainer: Melina Vidoni
description: |-
  An implementation of functionalities to transform directed graphs that are bound to a set of
  known forbidden paths. There are several transformations, following the rules provided by Villeneuve
  and Desaulniers (2005) <doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2004.01.032>, and Hsu et al. (2009) <doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-03095-6_60>.
  The resulting graph is generated in a data-frame format. See rsppfp website for more information,
  documentation an examples.
