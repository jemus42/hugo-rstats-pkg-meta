title: Environments Behaving (Almost) as Lists
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: List environments are environments that have list-like properties.  For
  instance, the elements of a list environment are ordered and can be accessed and
  iterated over using index subsetting, e.g. 'x <- listenv(a = 1, b = 2); for (i in
  seq_along(x)) x[[i]] <- x[[i]] ^ 2; y <- as.list(x)'.
