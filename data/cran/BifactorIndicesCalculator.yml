title: Bifactor Indices Calculator
maintainer: David Dueber
description: The calculator computes bifactor indices such as explained common variance
  (ECV), hierarchical Omega (OmegaH), percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC),
  item explained common variance (I-ECV), and more. This package is an R version of
  the 'Excel' based 'Bifactor Indices Calculator' (Dueber, 2017)  <doi:10.13023/edp.tool.01>
  with added convenience features for directly utilizing output from several programs
  that can fit confirmatory factor analysis or item response models.
