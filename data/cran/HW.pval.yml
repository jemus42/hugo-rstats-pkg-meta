description: |-
  HW.pval calculates plain and fully conditional
  root-mean-square, chi-square, and log likelihood-ratio P-values
  for the user-provided genotypic counts to be consistent with
  the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model.  For further information
  on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model and the pseudocode,
  refer to the paper "Testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a
  simple root-mean-square statistic" by Rachel Ward.
