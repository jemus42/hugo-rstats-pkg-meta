  Genetic Association Models for X-Chromosome SNPS on Continuous,
  Binary and Survival Outcomes
maintainer: Yi Zhu
description: |-
  The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome
  inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome
  inactivation (XCI-S). To analyze the X-linked genetic association for phenotype such as
  continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes with the actual process unknown, we propose a unified
  approach of maximizing the likelihood or partial likelihood over all of the potential biological
  processes. The methods are described in Wei Xu, Meiling Hao (2017) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22097>. And
