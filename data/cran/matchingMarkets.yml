title: Analysis of Stable Matchings
maintainer: Thilo Klein
description: |-
  Implements structural estimators to correct for
  the sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching
  markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents into
  groups as well as two-sided matching of students to schools.
  The package also contains algorithms to find stable matchings
  in the three most common matching problems: the stable roommates
  problem, the college admissions problem, and the house
  allocation problem.
