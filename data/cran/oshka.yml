title: Recursive Quoted Language Expansion
maintainer: Brodie Gaslam
description: |-
  Expands quoted language by recursively replacing any symbol that
  points to quoted language with the language it points to.  The recursive
  process continues until only symbols that point to non-language objects
  remain.  The resulting quoted language can then be evaluated normally.  This
  differs from the traditional 'quote'/'eval' pattern because it resolves
  intermediate language objects that would interfere with evaluation.
