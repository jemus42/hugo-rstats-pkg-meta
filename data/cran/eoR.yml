title: Data Management Package (Exposure and Occurrence Data in R)
maintainer: Rainer Walke
description: |-
  This data management package provides some helper
  classes for publicly available data sources (HMD, DESTATIS) in
  Demography. Similar to ideas developed in the Bioconductor
  project <https://bioconductor.org> we strive to encapsulate data in easy
  to use S4 objects.
  If original data is provided in a text file, the resulting S4
  object contains all information from that text file. But the
  information is somehow structured (header, footer, etc).
  Further the classes provide methods to make a subset for selected
  calendar years or selected regions. The resulting subset
  objects still contain the original header and footer information.
