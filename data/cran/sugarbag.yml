title: Create Tessellated Hexagon Maps
maintainer: Stephanie Kobakian
description: |-
  Create a hexagon tilegram from spatial polygons. Each polygon is
  represented by a hexagon tile, placed as close to it's original centroid
  as possible, with a focus on maintaining spatial relationship to a focal
  point. Developed to aid visualisation and analysis of spatial distributions
  across Australia, which can be challenging due to the concentration of the
  population on the coast and wide open interior.
