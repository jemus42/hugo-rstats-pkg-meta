title: Client for 'mapshaper' for 'Geospatial' Operations
maintainer: Andy Teucher
description: |-
  Edit and simplify 'geojson', 'Spatial', and 'sf'
  objects.  This is wrapper around the 'mapshaper' 'JavaScript' library
  by Matthew Bloch <https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/> to perform
  topologically-aware polygon simplification, as well as other
  operations such as clipping, erasing, dissolving, and converting
  'multi-part' to 'single-part' geometries.  It relies on the
  'geojsonio' package for working with 'geojson' objects, the 'sf'
  package for working with 'sf' objects, and the 'sp' and 'rgdal'
  packages for working with 'Spatial' objects.
