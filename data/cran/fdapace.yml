title: Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics
maintainer: Cody Carroll
description: |-
  A versatile package that provides implementation of various
  methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this
  package is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique for
  functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random trajectories
  and time courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation
  (PACE) algorithm. This core algorithm yields covariance and mean functions,
  eigenfunctions and principal component (scores), for both functional data and
  derivatives, for both dense (functional) and sparse (longitudinal) sampling designs.
  For sparse designs, it provides fitted continuous trajectories with confidence bands,
  even for subjects with very few longitudinal observations. PACE is a viable and
  flexible alternative to random effects modeling of longitudinal data. There is also a
  Matlab version (PACE) that contains some methods not available on fdapace and vice
  versa. Please cite our package if you use it (You may run the command
  citation("fdapace") to get the citation format and bibtex entry).
