title: Collaborative Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation
maintainer: Cheng Ju
description: Implements the general template for collaborative targeted maximum likelihood
  estimation. It also provides several commonly used C-TMLE instantiation, like the
  vanilla/scalable variable-selection C-TMLE (Ju et al. (2017) <doi:10.1177/0962280217729845>)
  and the glmnet-C-TMLE algorithm (Ju et al. (2017) <arXiv:1706.10029>).
