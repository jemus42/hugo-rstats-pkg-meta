version: '1.0'
title: Calculates Scrabble score for strings
maintainer: Will Kurt
description: Given a word will produce that word's scrabble score. Unlike many naive
  implementations this package takes into consideration the distribution of letter
  in scrabble. So a word like 'zzz' will be scored '10' rather than '30'.
