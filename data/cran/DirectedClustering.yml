title: Directed Weighted Clustering Coefficient
maintainer: Gian Paolo Clemente
description: |-
  Allows the computation of clustering coefficients for directed and weighted networks by using different approaches.
  It allows to compute clustering coefficients that are not present in 'igraph' package.
  A description of clustering coefficients can be found in "Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective", Clemente, G.P., Grassi, R. (2017),
  <doi:10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.007>.
