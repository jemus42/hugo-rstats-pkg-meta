  Correction of the P-Value after Multiple Coding in Generalized
  Linear Models
maintainer: Jeremie Riou
description: We propose to determine the correction of the significance level after
  multiple coding of an explanatory variable in Generalized Linear Model. The different
  methods of correction of the p-value are the Single step Bonferroni procedure, and
  resampling based methods developed by P.H.Westfall in 1993. Resampling methods are
  based on the permutation and the parametric bootstrap procedure. If some continuous,
  and dichotomous transformations are performed this package offers an exact correction
  of the p-value developed by B.Liquet & D.Commenges in 2005. The naive method with
  no correction is also available.
