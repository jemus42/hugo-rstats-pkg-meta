title: Methods of Moments
maintainer: Pierre Chausse
description: Several classes for moment-based models are defined. The classes are
  defined for moment conditions derived from a single equation or a system of equations.
  The conditions can also be expressed as functions or formulas. Several methods are
  also offered to facilitate the development of different estimation techniques. The
  methods that are currently provided are the Generalized method of moments (Hansen
  1982; <doi:10.2307/1912775>), for single equations and systems of equation, and  the
  Generalized Empirical Likelihood (Smith 1997; <doi:10.1111/j.0013-0133.1997.174.x>,
  Kitamura 1997; <doi:10.1214/aos/1069362388>, Newey and Smith 2004; <doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00482.x>,
  and Anatolyev 2005 <doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2005.00601.x>).
