title: Statistical Metrics for Multisite Replication Studies
maintainer: Maya B. Mathur
description: |-
  For a multisite replication project, computes the consistency metric P_orig, which is
  the probability that the original study would observe an estimated effect size as extreme or more extreme
  than it actually did, if in fact the original study were statistically consistent with the replications. Other
  recommended metrics are: (1) the probability of a true effect of scientifically meaningful size in the same direction as the estimate
  the original study; and (2) the probability of a true effect of meaningful size in the direction opposite
  the original study's estimate. These two can be computed using the package \code{MetaUtility::prop_stronger}.
  Additionally computes older metrics used in replication projects (namely expected agreement in "statistical significance" between an original study and replication studies as well
  as prediction intervals for the replication estimates). See Mathur and VanderWeele (under review; <https://osf.io/apnjk/>)
  for details.
