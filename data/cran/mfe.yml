title: Meta-Feature Extractor
maintainer: Adriano Rivolli
description: |-
  Extracts meta-features from datasets to support the design of
  recommendation systems based on Meta-Learning. The meta-features, also called
  characterization measures, are able to characterize the complexity of datasets
  and to provide estimates of algorithm performance. The package contains not
  only the standard characterization measures, but also more recent
  characterization measures. By making available a large set of meta-feature
  extraction functions, tasks like comprehensive data characterization, deep
  data exploration and large number of Meta-Learning based data analysis can be
  performed. These concepts are described in the paper: Rivolli A., Garcia L.,
  Soares c., Vanschoren J. and Carvalho A. (2018) <arXiv:1808.10406>.
