title: Full Factorial Breeding Analysis
maintainer: Aimee Lee Houde
description: 'We facilitate the analysis of full factorial mating designs with mixed-effects
  models. The observed data functions extract the variance explained by random and
  fixed effects and provide their significance. We then calculate the additive genetic,
  nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance components explaining the phenotype.
  In particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for estimating these components
  for nonnormal data types. The resampled data functions are used to produce bootstrap
  confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple function. This package
  will facilitate the analyses of full factorial mating designs in R, especially for
  the analysis of binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability
  to incorporate additional random and fixed effects and power analyses. The paper
  associated with the package including worked examples is: Houde ALS, Pitcher TE
  (2016) <doi:10.1002/ece3.1943>.'
