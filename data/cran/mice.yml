description: |-
  Multiple imputation using Fully Conditional Specification (FCS)
  implemented by the MICE algorithm as described in Van Buuren and
  Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v045.i03>. Each variable has
  its own imputation model. Built-in imputation models are provided for
  continuous data (predictive mean matching, normal), binary data (logistic
  regression), unordered categorical data (polytomous logistic regression)
  and ordered categorical data (proportional odds). MICE can also impute
  continuous two-level data (normal model, pan, second-level variables).
  Passive imputation can be used to maintain consistency between variables.
  Various diagnostic plots are available to inspect the quality of the
  imputations.
