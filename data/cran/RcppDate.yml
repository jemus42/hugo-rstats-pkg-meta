title: '''date'' C++ Header Library for Date and Time Functionality'
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  'date' is a C++ header library offering extensive date
  and time functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards
  written by Howard Hinnant and released under the MIT license. A
  slightly modified version has been accepted (along with 'tz.h') as
  part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from the
  upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that other R packages can
  use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the types have
  explicit 'Rcpp' wrapper though these may be added as needed.
