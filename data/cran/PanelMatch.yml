  Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series
  Cross-Sectional Data

description: |-
  Implements a set of methodological tools
  that enable researchers to apply matching methods to
  time-series cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang
  (2018) <http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf>
  proposes a nonparametric generalization of the
  difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
  on the linearity assumption as often done in
  practice. Researchers first select a method of matching
  each treated observation for a given unit in a
  particular time period with control observations from
  other units in the same time period that have a similar
  treatment and covariate history. These methods include
  standard matching methods based on propensity score and
  Mahalanobis distance, as well as weighting methods. Once
  matching is done, both short-term and long-term average
  treatment effects for the treated can be estimated with
  standard errors. The package also offers a visualization
  technique that allows researchers to assess the quality
  of matches by examining the resulting covariate balance.
