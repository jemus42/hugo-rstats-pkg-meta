title: Easy Interface to Effective Concentration Calculations
maintainer: Zhian N. Kamvar
description: |-
  Because fungicide resistance is an important phenotypic trait for
  fungi and oomycetes, it is necessary to have a standardized method of
  statistically analyzing the Effective Concentration (EC) values. This
  package is designed for those who are not terribly familiar with R to be
  able to analyze and plot an entire set of isolates using the 'drc' package.
