title: Statistics for psychiatric research
maintainer: Yasuyuki Okumura
description: The rpsychi offers a number of functions for psychiatry, psychiatric
  nursing, clinical psychology. Functions are primarily for statistical significance
  testing using published work. For example, you can conduct a factorial analysis
  of variance (ANOVA), which requires only the mean, standard deviation, and sample
  size for each cell, rather than the individual data. This package covers fundamental
  statistical tests such as t-test, chi-square test, analysis of variance, and multiple
  regression analysis. With some exceptions, you can obtain effect size and its confidence
  interval. These functions help you to obtain effect size from published work, and
  then to conduct a priori power analysis or meta-analysis, even if a researcher do
  not report effect size in a published work.
