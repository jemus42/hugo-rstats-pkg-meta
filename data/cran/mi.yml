title: Missing Data Imputation and Model Checking
maintainer: Ben Goodrich
description: The mi package provides functions for data manipulation, imputing missing
  values in an approximate Bayesian framework, diagnostics of the models used to generate
  the imputations, confidence-building mechanisms to validate some of the assumptions
  of the imputation algorithm, and functions to analyze multiply imputed data sets
  with the appropriate degree of sampling uncertainty.
