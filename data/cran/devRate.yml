  Quantify the Relationship Between Development Rate and
  Temperature in Ectotherms
maintainer: Francois Rebaudo
description: |-
  A set of functions to quantify the relationship between development
  rate and temperature and to build phenological models. The package comprises
  a set of models and estimated parameters borrowed from a literature review
  in ectotherms. The methods and literature review are described in Rebaudo
  et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12935> and Rebaudo and Rabhi (2018)
  <doi:10.1111/eea.12693>. An example can be found in Rebaudo et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s13355-017-0480-5>.
