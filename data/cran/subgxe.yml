title: Combine Multiple GWAS by Using Gene-Environment Interactions
maintainer: Alexander Rix
description: |-
  Classical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide
  association studies (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects and power can
  be compromised in the presence of heterogeneity. 'subgxe' is a R package
  that implements p-value assisted subset testing for association (pASTA),
  a method developed by Yu et al. (2019) <doi:10.1159/000496867>. pASTA
  generalizes association analysis based on subsets by incorporating
  gene-environment interactions into the testing procedure.
