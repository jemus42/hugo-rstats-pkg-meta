title: Easy Access to Model Information for Various Model Objects
maintainer: Daniel LÃ¼decke
description: |-
  A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to
  information contained in various R models, like model formulas, model terms,
  information about random effects, data that was used to fit the model or
  data from response variables. 'insight' mainly revolves around two types
  of functions: Functions that find (the names of) information, starting with
  'find_', and functions that get the underlying data, starting with 'get_'.
  The package has a consistent syntax and works with many different model
  objects, where otherwise functions to access these information are missing.
