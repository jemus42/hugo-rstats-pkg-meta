  Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Its Uncertainty in Tropical
  Forests
maintainer: Maxime Réjou-Méchain
description: |-
  Contains functions to estimate aboveground biomass/carbon and its uncertainty in tropical forests.
  These functions allow to (1) retrieve and to correct taxonomy, (2) estimate wood density and its uncertainty,
  (3) construct height-diameter models, (4) manage tree and plot coordinates,
  (5) estimate the aboveground biomass/carbon at the stand level with associated uncertainty.
