title: Estimate Power and Required Sample Size in QCA
maintainer: Ingo Rohlfing
description: |-
  Researchers working with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)
  can use the package to estimate power of a sufficient term
  using permutation tests. A term can be anything: A condition, conjunction or
  disjunction of any combination of these. The package further allows users to plot
  the estimation results and to estimate the number of cases required to achieve a
  certain level of power, given a prespecified null and alternative hypothesis.
