title: High-Dimensional Regression with Measurement Error
maintainer: Oystein Sorensen
description: |-
  Penalized regression for generalized linear models for
  measurement error problems (aka. errors-in-variables). The package
  contains a version of the lasso (L1-penalization) which corrects
  for measurement error (Sorensen et al. (2015) <doi:10.5705/ss.2013.180>).
  It also contains an implementation of the Generalized Matrix Uncertainty
  Selector, which is a version the (Generalized) Dantzig Selector for the
  case of measurement error (Sorensen et al. (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1425626>).
