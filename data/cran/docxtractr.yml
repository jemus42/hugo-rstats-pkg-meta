  Extract Data Tables and Comments from 'Microsoft' 'Word'
  Documents
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  'Microsoft Word' 'docx' files provide an 'XML' structure that is fairly
  straightforward to navigate, especially when it applies to 'Word' tables and
  comments. Tools are provided to determine table count/structure, comment count
  and also to extract/clean tables and comments from 'Microsoft Word' 'docx' documents.
  There is also nascent support for '.doc' files.
