title: Terminal Text Formatting Using Escape Sequences
maintainer: Christofer Backlin
description: |-
  Can be used for coloring output in terminals.
  It was developed for the standard Ubuntu terminal but should be compatible
  with any terminal using xterm or ANSI escape sequences. If run in windows,
  RStudio, or any other platform not supporting such escape sequences it
  gracefully passes on any output without modifying it.
