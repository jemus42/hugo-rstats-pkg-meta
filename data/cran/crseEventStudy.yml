  A Robust and Powerful Test of Abnormal Stock Returns in
  Long-Horizon Event Studies
maintainer: Siegfried KÃ¶stlmeier
description: Based on Dutta et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jempfin.2018.02.004>, this
  package provides their standardized test for abnormal returns in long-horizon event
  studies. The methods used improve the major weaknesses of size, power, and robustness
  of long-run statistical tests described in Kothari/Warner (2007) <doi:10.1016/B978-0-444-53265-7.50015-9>.
  Abnormal returns are weighted by their statistical precision (i.e., standard deviation),
  resulting in abnormal standardized returns. This procedure efficiently captures
  the heteroskedasticity problem. Clustering techniques following Cameron et al. (2011)
  <10.1198/jbes.2010.07136> are adopted for computing cross-sectional correlation
  robust standard errors. The statistical tests in this package therefore accounts
  for potential biases arising from returns' cross-sectional correlation, autocorrelation,
  and volatility clustering without power loss.
