title: Render R Markdown Outputs Lazily
maintainer: ORPHANED
description: |-
  An R Markdown html document format that provides the ability to lazily
  load plot outputs as the user scrolls over them.  This is useful for large R
  Markdown documents with many plots, as it allows for a fast initial page load and
  defers loading of individual graphics to the time that the user navigates near them.
