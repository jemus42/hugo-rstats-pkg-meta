  Fast Spline Function Based Constrained Maximum Likelihood
  Estimator for AUC Estimation of Interval Censored Survival Data
maintainer: Jiaxing Lin<jiaxing.lin@duke.edu>
description: The kernel of this 'Rcpp' based package is an efficient implementation
  of the generalized gradient projection method for spline function based constrained
  maximum likelihood estimator for interval censored survival data (Wu, Yuan; Zhang,
  Ying. Partially monotone tensor spline estimation of the joint distribution function
  with bivariate current status data. Ann. Statist. 40, 2012, 1609-1636 <doi:10.1214/12-AOS1016>).
  The key function computes the density function of the joint distribution of event
  time and the marker and returns the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
  for the interval censored survival data as well as area under the curve (AUC).
