  Calculating Effective Sizes Based on Known Demographic
  Parameters of a Population
maintainer: Annegret Grimm
description: Effective population sizes (often abbreviated as "Neff") are essential
  in biodiversity monitoring and conservation. For the first time, calculating effective
  sizes with data obtained within less than a generation but considering demographic
  parameters is possible. This individual based model uses demographic parameters
  of a population to calculate annual effective sizes and effective population sizes
  (per generation). A defined number of alleles and loci will be used to simulate
  the genotypes of the individuals. Stepwise mutation rates can be included. Variations
  in life history parameters (sex ratio, sex-specific survival, recruitment rate,
  reproductive skew) are possible. These results will help managers to define existing
  populations as viable or not.
