title: Birnbaum-Saunders Model
maintainer: Rocio Paola Maehara
description: It provides the density, distribution function, quantile function, random
  number generator, reliability function, failure rate, likelihood function, moments
  and EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimators, also empirical quantile and
  generated envelope for a given sample, all this for the three parameter Birnbaum-Saunders
  model based on Skew-Normal Distribution. Also, it provides the random number generator
  for the mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal distribution. Additionally,
  we incorporate the EM algorithm based on the assumption that the error term follows
  a finite mixture of Sinh-normal distributions.
