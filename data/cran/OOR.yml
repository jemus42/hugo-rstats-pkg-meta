title: Optimistic Optimization in R
maintainer: M. Binois
description: Implementation of optimistic optimization methods for global optimization
  of deterministic or stochastic functions. The algorithms feature guarantees of the
  convergence to a global optimum. They require minimal assumptions on the (only local)
  smoothness, where the smoothness parameter does not need to be known. They are expected
  to be useful for the most difficult functions when we have no information on smoothness
  and the gradients are unknown or do not exist. Due to the weak assumptions, however,
  they can be mostly effective only in small dimensions, for example, for hyperparameter
  tuning.
