title: Selection of Training Populations by Genetic Algorithm
maintainer: Deniz Akdemir
description: Combining Predictive Analytics and Experimental Design to Optimize Results.
  To be utilized to select a test data calibrated training population in high dimensional
  prediction problems and assumes that the explanatory variables are observed for
  all of the individuals. Once a "good" training set is identified, the response variable
  can be obtained only for this set to build a model for predicting the response in
  the test set. The algorithms in the package can be tweaked to solve some other subset
  selection problems.
