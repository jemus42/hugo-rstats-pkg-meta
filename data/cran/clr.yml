title: Curve Linear Regression via Dimension Reduction
maintainer: Amandine Pierrot
description: |-
  A new methodology for linear regression with both curve response
  and curve regressors, which is described in Cho, Goude, Brossat and Yao
  (2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.722900> and (2015)
  <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-18732-7_3>. The key idea behind this methodology is
  dimension reduction based on a singular value decomposition in a Hilbert
  space, which reduces the curve regression problem to several scalar linear
  regression problems.
