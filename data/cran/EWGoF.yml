description: 'Contains a large number of the goodness-of-fit tests for the Exponential
  and Weibull distributions classified into families: the tests based on the empirical
  distribution function, the tests based on the probability plot, the tests based
  on the normalized spacings, the tests based on the Laplace transform and the likelihood
  based tests.'
