title: Modular Approach to Dose Finding Clinical Trials
maintainer: Kristian Brock
description: |-
  Methods for working with dose-finding clinical trials. We start by
  providing a common interface to various dose-finding methodologies like the
  continual reassessment method (CRM) by O'Quigley et al. (1990)
  <doi:10.2307/2531628>, the Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN) by Liu &
  Yuan (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12089>, and the 3+3 described by Korn et al.
  (1994) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780131802>. We then add optional embellishments to
  provide extra desirable behaviour, like avoiding skipping doses, stopping
  after n patients have been treated at the recommended dose, or demanding
  that n patients are treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining
  together these embellishments using the pipe operator from 'magrittr', it is
  simple to tailor the behaviour of dose-finding designs so that they do what
  you want. Furthermore, using this flexible interface for creating
  dose-finding designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate
  dose-pathways for future cohorts of patients.
