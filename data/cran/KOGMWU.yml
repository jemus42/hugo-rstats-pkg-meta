title: Functional Summary and Meta-Analysis of Gene Expression Data
maintainer: Mikhail V. Matz
description: Rank-based tests for enrichment of KOG (euKaryotic Orthologous Groups)
  classes with up- or down-regulated genes based on a continuous measure. The meta-analysis
  is based on correlation of KOG delta-ranks across datasets (delta-rank is the difference
  between mean rank of genes belonging to a KOG class and mean rank of all other genes).
  With binary measure (1 or 0 to indicate significant and non-significant genes),
  one-tailed Fisher's exact test for over-representation of each KOG class among significant
  genes will be performed.
