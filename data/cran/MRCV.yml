  Methods for Analyzing Multiple Response Categorical Variables
  (MRCVs)
maintainer: Natalie Koziol
description: |-
  The MRCV package provides functions for analyzing the association between
  one single response categorical variable (SRCV) and one multiple response
  categorical variable (MRCV), or between two or three MRCVs.  A modified Pearson
  chi-square statistic can be used to test for marginal independence for the one or
  two MRCV case, or a more general loglinear modeling approach can be used to examine
  various other structures of association for the two or three MRCV case.  Bootstrap-
  and asymptotic-based standardized residuals and model-predicted odds ratios are
  available, in addition to other descriptive information.
