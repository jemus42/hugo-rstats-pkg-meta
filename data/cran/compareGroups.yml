description: Create data summaries for quality control, extensive reports for exploring
  data, as well as publication-ready univariate or bivariate tables in several formats
  (plain text, HTML,LaTeX, PDF, Word or Excel. Create figures to quickly visualise
  the distribution of your data (boxplots, barplots, normality-plots, etc.). Display
  statistics (mean, median, frequencies, incidences, etc.). Perform the appropriate
  tests (t-test, Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher, log-rank, ...) depending
  on the nature of the described variable (normal, non-normal or qualitative). Summarize
  genetic data (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) data displaying Allele Frequencies
  and performing Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium tests among other typical statistics and
  tests for these kind of data.
