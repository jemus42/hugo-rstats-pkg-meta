  Sequential Quadratic Programming for Fast Maximum-Likelihood
  Estimation of Mixture Proportions
maintainer: Peter Carbonetto
description: |-
  Provides an optimization method based on sequential
  quadratic programming (SQP) for maximum likelihood estimation of
  the mixture proportions in a finite mixture model where the
  component densities are known. The algorithm is expected to obtain
  solutions that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art
  MOSEK interior-point solver (called by function "KWDual" in the
  'REBayes' package), and they are expected to arrive at solutions
  more quickly when the number of samples is large and the number of
  mixture components is not too large. This implements the "mix-SQP"
  algorithm, with some improvements, described in Y. Kim,
