title: Functions for Robust Variable Handling
maintainer: Mehrad Mahmoudian
description: Variables are the fundamental parts of each programming language but
  handling them efficiently might be frustrating for programmers. This package contains
  some functions to help user (especially data explorers) to make more sense of their
  variables and take the most out of variables and hardware resources. These functions
  are written, collected and crafted over 7 years of experience in statistical data
  analysis on high-dimensional data, and for each of them there was a need. Functions
  in this package are suppose to be efficient and easy to use, hence they will be
  frequently updated to make them more convenient.
