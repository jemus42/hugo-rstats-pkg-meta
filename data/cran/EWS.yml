description: Early Warning Systems (EWS) are a toolbox for policymakers to prevent
  or attenuate the impact of economic downturns. Modern EWS are based on the econometric
  framework of Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.4.777>. Specifically,
  this framework includes four dichotomous models, relying on a logit approach to
  model the relationship between yield spreads and future recessions, controlling
  for recession risk factors. These models can be estimated in a univariate or a balanced
  panel framework as in Candelon, Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.03.015>.
  This package provides both methods for estimating these models and a dataset covering
  13 OECD countries over a period of 45 years. This package constitutes a useful toolbox
  (data and functions) for scholars as well as policymakers.
