  Provide a tool to easily build customized data flows to pre-process large volumes
  of information from different sources. To this end, 'bdpar' allows to (i) easily use and
  create new functionalities and (ii) develop new data source extractors according to the
  user needs. Additionally, the package provides by default a predefined data flow
  to extract and pre-process the most relevant information (tokens, dates, ... ) from some textual
  sources (SMS, Email, tweets, YouTube comments).
