title: Robust Estimation of Location and Scatter
maintainer: Steffen Liebscher
description: The restlos package provides algorithms for robust estimation of location
  (mean and mode) and scatter based on minimum spanning trees (pMST), self-organizing
  maps (Flood Algorithm), Delaunay triangulations (RDELA), and nested minimum volume
  convex sets (MVCH). The functions are also suitable for outlier detection.
