  Mean Partition, Uncertainty Assessment, Cluster Validation and
  Visualization Selection for Cluster Analysis
maintainer: Lixiang Zhang
description: Providing mean partition for ensemble clustering by optimal transport
  alignment(OTA), uncertainty measures for both partition-wise and cluster-wise assessment
  and multiple visualization functions to show uncertainty, for instance, membership
  heat map and plot of covering point set. A partition refers to an overall clustering
  result.
