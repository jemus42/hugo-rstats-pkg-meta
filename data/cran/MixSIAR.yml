title: Bayesian Mixing Models in R
maintainer: Brian Stock
description: |-
  Creates and runs Bayesian mixing models to analyze
  biological tracer data (i.e. stable isotopes, fatty acids), which estimate the
  proportions of source (prey) contributions to a mixture (consumer). 'MixSIAR'
  is not one model, but a framework that allows a user to create a mixing model
  based on their data structure and research questions, via options for fixed/
  random effects, source data types, priors, and error terms. 'MixSIAR' incorporates
  several years of advances since 'MixSIR' and 'SIAR'.
