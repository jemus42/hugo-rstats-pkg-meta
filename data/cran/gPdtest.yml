title: Bootstrap goodness-of-fit test for the generalized Pareto<U+000a>distribution
maintainer: Elizabeth Gonzalez Estrada
description: This package computes the bootstrap goodness-of-fit test<U+000a>for the
  generalized Pareto distribution by Villasenor-Alva and<U+000a>Gonzalez-Estrada (2009).
  The null hypothesis includes heavy and<U+000a>non-heavy tailed gPd's. A function
  for fitting the gPd to data<U+000a>using the parameter estimation methods proposed
  in the same<U+000a>article is also provided.
