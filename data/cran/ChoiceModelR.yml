title: Choice Modeling in R
maintainer: John V Colias
description: Implements an MCMC algorithm to estimate a hierarchical<U+000a>multinomial
  logit model with a normal heterogeneity<U+000a>distribution. The algorithm uses
  a hybrid Gibbs Sampler with a<U+000a>random walk metropolis step for the MNL coefficients
  for each<U+000a>unit. Dependent variable may be discrete or continuous.<U+000a>Independent
  variables may be discrete or continuous with<U+000a>optional order constraints.
  Means of the distribution of<U+000a>heterogeneity can optionally be modeled as a
  linear function of<U+000a>unit characteristics variables.
