  Accelerated Failure Time Model with Generalized Estimating
  Equations
maintainer: Sy Han Chiou
description: |-
  A collection of methods for both the rank-based estimates and least-square estimates
  to the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model.
  For rank-based estimation, it provides approaches that include the computationally
  efficient Gehan's weight and the general's weight such as the logrank weight.
  Details of the rank-based estimation can be found in
  Chiou et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9388-2> and
  Chiou et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/sim.6415>.
  For the least-square estimation, the estimating equation is solved with
  generalized estimating equations (GEE).
  Moreover, in multivariate cases, the dependence working correlation structure
  can be specified in GEE's setting.
  Details on the least-squares estimation can be found in
  Chiou et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s10985-014-9292-x>.
