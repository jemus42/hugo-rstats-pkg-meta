title: Fit Repeated Linear Regressions
maintainer: Lijun Wang
description: When fitting a set of linear regressions which have some same variables,
  we can separate the matrix and reduce the computation cost. This package aims to
  fit a set of repeated linear regressions faster. More details can be found in this
  blog Lijun Wang (2017) <https://stats.hohoweiya.xyz/2017/09/26/An-R-Package-Fit-Repeated-Linear-Regressions/>.
