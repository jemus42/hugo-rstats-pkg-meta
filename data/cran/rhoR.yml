title: Rho for Inter Rater Reliability
maintainer: Cody L Marquart
description: |-
  Rho is used to test the generalization of inter rater reliability
  (IRR) statistics. Calculating rho starts by generating a large number of
  simulated, fully-coded data sets: a sizable collection of hypothetical
  populations, all of which have a kappa value below a given threshold -- which
  indicates unacceptable agreement. Then kappa is calculated on a sample from
  each of those sets in the collection to see if it is equal to or higher than
  the kappa in then real sample. If less than five percent of the distribution
  of samples from the simulated data sets is greater than actual observed kappa,
  the null hypothesis is rejected and one can conclude that if the two raters had
  coded the rest of the data, we would have acceptable agreement (kappa above the
  threshold).
