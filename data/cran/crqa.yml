  Continuous Time-Series

description: |2-

  Cross-recurrence quantification analysis
  of two time-series, of either categorical or
  continuous values. It provides different methods
  for profiling cross-recurrence, i.e., only looking
  at the diagonal recurrent points, as well as more
  in-depth measures of the whole cross-recurrence plot,
  e.g., recurrence rate. Please refer to by Coco and Dale (2014)
  <doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00510> for further details about the method.
