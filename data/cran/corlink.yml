  Record Linkage, Incorporating Imputation for Missing Agreement
  Patterns, and Modeling Correlation Patterns Between Fields
maintainer: John Ferguson
description: A matrix of agreement patterns and counts for record pairs is the input
  for the procedure.  An EM algorithm is used to impute plausible values for missing
  record pairs.  A second EM algorithm, incorporating possible correlations between
  per-field agreement, is used to estimate posterior probabilities that each pair
  is a true match - i.e. constitutes the same individual.
