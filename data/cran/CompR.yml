title: Paired Comparison Data Analysis
maintainer: Michel Semenou
description: Different tools for describing and analysing paired comparison data are
  presented. Main methods are estimation of products scores according Bradley Terry
  Luce model. A segmentation of the individual could be conducted on the basis of
  a mixture distribution approach. The number of classes can be tested by the use
  of Monte Carlo simulations. This package deals also with multi-criteria paired comparison
  data.
