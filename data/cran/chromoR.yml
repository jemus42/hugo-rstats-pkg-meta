title: Analysis of chromosomal interactions data (correction,<U+000a>segmentation
  and comparison)
maintainer: Yoli Shavit
description: chromoR provides users with a statistical pipeline for analysing chromosomal
  interactions data (Hi-C data).It combines wavelet methods and a Bayesian approach
  for correction (bias and noise) and comparison (detecting significant changes between
  Hi-C maps) of Hi-C contact maps.In addition, it also support detection of change
  points in 1D Hi-C contact profiles.
