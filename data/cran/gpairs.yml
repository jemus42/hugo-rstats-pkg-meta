title: The Generalized Pairs Plot
maintainer: John W. Emerson
description: Offers a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition
  that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional
  grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more
  variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers
  a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables.
