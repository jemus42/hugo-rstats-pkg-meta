title: Interval Testing Procedure for Functional Data
maintainer: Alessia Pini
description: 'Implementation of the Interval Testing Procedure for functional data
  in different frameworks (i.e., one or two-population frameworks, functional linear
  models) by means of different basis expansions (i.e., B-spline, Fourier, and phase-amplitude
  Fourier). The current version of the package requires functional data evaluated
  on a uniform grid; it automatically projects each function on a chosen functional
  basis; it performs the entire family of multivariate tests; and, finally, it provides
  the matrix of the p-values of the previous tests and the vector of the corrected
  p-values. The functional basis, the coupled or uncoupled scenario, and the kind
  of test can be chosen by the user. The package provides also a plotting function
  creating a graphical output of the procedure: the p-value heat-map, the plot of
  the corrected p-values, and the plot of the functional data.'
