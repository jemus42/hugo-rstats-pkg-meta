description: |-
  The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) provides tools to enable users
  of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and visualise data on
  Australian plants and animals; these have been made available from
  <https://ala.org.au/>. ALA4R provides a subset of the tools to be
  directly used within R. It enables the R community to directly access data
  and resources hosted by the ALA.
