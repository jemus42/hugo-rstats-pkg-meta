  A Method to Search for Differentially Expressed Genes and to
  Detect Recurrent Chromosomal Copy Number Aberrations
maintainer: Doulaye Dembele
description: |-
  A fold change rank based method is presented to search for genes with changing
  expression and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy number aberrations. This
  method may be useful for high-throughput biological data (micro-array, sequencing, ...).
  Probabilities are associated with genes or probes in the data set and there is no
  problem of multiple tests when using this method. For array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization data, segmentation results are obtained by merging the significant
  probes detected.
