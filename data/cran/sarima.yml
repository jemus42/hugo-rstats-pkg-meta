version: 0.8.2
title: Simulation and Prediction with Seasonal ARIMA Models
maintainer: Georgi N. Boshnakov
description: |-
  Functions, classes and methods for time series modelling with ARIMA
  and related models. The aim of the package is to provide consistent
  interface for the user. For example, a single function autocorrelations()
  computes various kinds of theoretical and sample autocorrelations. This is
  work in progress, see the documentation and vignettes for the current
  functionality.  Function sarima() fits extended multiplicative seasonal
  ARIMA models with trends, exogenous variables and arbitrary roots on the
  unit circle, which can be fixed or estimated.
