title: Tools for Analyzing Finite Mixture Models
maintainer: Derek Young
description: Analyzes finite mixture models for various parametric and semiparametric
  settings.  This includes mixtures of parametric distributions (normal, multivariate
  normal, multinomial, gamma), various Reliability Mixture Models (RMMs), mixtures-of-regressions
  settings (linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, linear regression
  with changepoints, predictor-dependent mixing proportions, random effects regressions,
  hierarchical mixtures-of-experts), and tools for selecting the number of components
  (bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test statistic, mixturegrams, and model selection
  criteria).  Bayesian estimation of mixtures-of-linear-regressions models is available
  as well as a novel data depth method for obtaining credible bands.  This package
  is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.
