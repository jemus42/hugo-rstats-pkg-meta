maintainer: Rodney Edmondson
description: |-
  Example software for the analysis of data from designed
  experiments, especially agricultural crop experiments. The basics
  of the analysis of designed experiments are discussed
  using real examples from agricultural field trials.
  A range of statistical methods using a range
  of R statistical packages are  exemplified . The experimental
  data is made available as separate data sets for each example
  and the R analysis code is made available as example code.
  The example code can be readily extended, as required.
