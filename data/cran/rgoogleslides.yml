title: R Interface to Google Slides
maintainer: Hairizuan Noorazman
description: Previously, when one is working with in the Google Ecosystem (Using Google
  Drive etc), there is hardly any good workflow of getting the values calculated from
  R and getting that into Google Slides. The normal and easy way out would be to just
  copy your work over but when you have a number of analysis to present with a lot
  of changes between each environment, it just becomes quite cumbersome.
