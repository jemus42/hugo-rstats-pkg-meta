title: Approximate Unconditional and Permutation Tests
maintainer: Arjun Sondhi
description: |-
  Performs approximate unconditional and permutation testing for
  2x2 contingency tables. Motivated by testing for disease association with rare
  genetic variants in case-control studies. When variants are extremely rare,
  these tests give better control of Type I error than standard tests.
