title: Bayesian Regression Models with Global-Local Shrinkage Priors
maintainer: Daniel F. Schmidt
description: Fits linear or logistic regression model using Bayesian global-local
  shrinkage prior hierarchies as described in Polson and Scott (2010) <doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694587.003.0017>.
  Handles ridge, lasso, horseshoe and horseshoe+ regression with logistic, Gaussian,
  Laplace or Student-t distributed targets using the algorithms summarized in Makalic
  and Schmidt (2016) <arXiv:1611.06649>.
