title: Multiple Imputation using Chained Random Forests
maintainer: Shangzhi Hong
description: |-
  Functions for methods for multiple imputation using chained random
  forests. Implemented algorithms can handle missing data in both continuous
  and categorical variables by using prediction-based or node-based
  conditional distributions constructed using random forests. For
  prediction-based imputation, the method based on the empirical distribution
  of out-of-bag prediction errors of random forests and the method based on
  normality assumption are provided. For node-based imputation, the method
  based on the conditional distribution formed by predicting nodes of random
  forests and the method based on measures of proximities of random forests
  are provided. More details of the statistical methods can be found in
  Hong et al. (2020) <arXiv:2004.14823>.
