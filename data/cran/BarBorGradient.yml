title: Function Minimum Approximator
maintainer: JÃ¡nos Hevner
description: |-
  Tool to find where a function has its lowest value(minimum). The
  functions can be any dimensions. Recommended use is with eps=10^-10, but can be
  run with 10^-20, although this depends on the function. Two more methods are in
  this package, simple gradient method (Gradmod) and Powell method (Powell). These
  are not recommended for use, their purpose are purely for comparison.
