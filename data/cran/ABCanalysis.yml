title: Computed ABC Analysis
maintainer: Florian Lerch
description: For a given data set, the package provides a novel method of computing
  precise limits to acquire subsets which are easily interpreted. Closely related
  to the Lorenz curve, the ABC curve visualizes the data by graphically representing
  the cumulative distribution function. Based on an ABC analysis the algorithm calculates,
  with the help of the ABC curve, the optimal limits by exploiting the mathematical
  properties pertaining to distribution of analyzed items. The data containing positive
  values is divided into three disjoint subsets A, B and C, with subset A comprising
  very profitable values, i.e. largest data values ("the important few"), subset B
  comprising values where the yield equals to the effort required to obtain it, and
  the subset C comprising of non-profitable values, i.e., the smallest data sets ("the
  trivial many"). Package is based on "Computed ABC Analysis for rational Selection
  of most informative Variables in multivariate Data", PLoS One. Ultsch. A., Lotsch
