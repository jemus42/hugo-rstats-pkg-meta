title: '''ggplot2'' Based Publication Ready Plots'
maintainer: Alboukadel Kassambara
description: |-
  The 'ggplot2' package is excellent and flexible for elegant data
  visualization in R. However the default generated plots requires some formatting
  before we can send them for publication. Furthermore, to customize a 'ggplot',
  the syntax is opaque and this raises the level of difficulty for researchers
  with no advanced R programming skills. 'ggpubr' provides some easy-to-use
  functions for creating and customizing 'ggplot2'- based publication ready plots.
