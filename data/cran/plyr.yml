title: Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: |-
  A set of tools that solves a common set of
  problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces,
  operate on each piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For
  example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or
  time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse
  high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development
  of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton Dickinson'.
