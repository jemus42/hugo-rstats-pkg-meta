description: |-
  API client for 'ClimMob', an open source software for crowdsourcing
  citizen science in agriculture under the 'tricot' method <https://climmob.net/>.
  Developed by van Etten et al. (2019) <doi:10.1017/S0014479716000739>, it turns the
  research paradigm on its head; instead of a few researchers designing complicated
  trials to compare several technologies in search of the best solutions,
  it enables many farmers to carry out reasonably simple experiments that
  taken together can offer even more information. 'ClimMobTools' enables project
  managers to deep explore and analyse their 'ClimMob' data in R.
