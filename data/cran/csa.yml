description: Integration of Earth system data from various sources is a challenging
  task. Except for their qualitative heterogeneity, different data records exist for
  describing similar Earth system process at different spatio-temporal scales. Data
  inter-comparison and validation are usually performed at a single spatial or temporal
  scale, which could hamper the identification of potential discrepancies in other
  scales. 'csa' package offers a simple, yet efficient, graphical method for synthesizing
  and comparing observed and modelled data across a range of spatio-temporal scales.
  Instead of focusing at specific scales, such as annual means or original grid resolution,
  we examine how their statistical properties change across spatio-temporal continuum.
