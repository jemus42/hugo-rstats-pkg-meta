title: Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Algorithm for solving Ax=b
maintainer: B N Mandal
description: The package solves linear system of equations Ax=b by using Preconditioned
  Conjugate Gradient Algorithm where A is real symmetric positive definite matrix.
  A suitable preconditioner matrix may be provided by user. This can also be used
  to minimize quadratic function (x'Ax)/2-bx for unknown x.
