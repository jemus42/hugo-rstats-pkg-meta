title: Empirical Bayes Variable Selection via ICM/M Algorithm
maintainer: Vitara Pungpapong
description: Carries out empirical Bayes variable selection via ICM/M algorithm. The
  basic problem is to fit high-dimensional regression which most coefficients are
  assumed to be zero. This package allows incorporating the Ising prior to capture
  structure of predictors in the modeling process. The current version of this package
  can handle the normal, binary logistic, and Cox's regression (Pungpapong et. al.
  (2015) <doi:10.1214/15-EJS1034>, Pungpapong et. al. (2017) <arXiv:1707.08298>).
