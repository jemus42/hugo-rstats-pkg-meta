title: A Simple Way to Specify Symmetric, Block Diagonal Matrices
maintainer: Matthew L. Fidler
description: |-
  Provides a simple mechanism to specify a symmetric block diagonal matrices (often
  used for covariance matrices).  This is based on the domain specific language implemented
  in 'nlmixr' but expanded to create matrices in R generally instead of specifying parts of matrices
  to estimate.
