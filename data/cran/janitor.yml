title: Simple Tools for Examining and Cleaning Dirty Data
maintainer: Sam Firke
description: |-
  The main janitor functions can: perfectly format data.frame column
  names; provide quick counts of variable combinations (i.e., frequency
  tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records. Other janitor functions
  nicely format the tabulation results. These tabulate-and-report functions
  approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package
  follows the principles of the "tidyverse" and works well with the pipe function
  %>%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is
  optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything
  covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for
  the fun stuff.
