title: Renewal Hawkes Process
maintainer: Feng Chen
description: |-
  Simulate a renewal Hawkes (RHawkes) self-exciting process,
  with a given immigrant hazard rate function and offspring density function.
  Calculate the likelihood of a RHawkes process with given hazard rate function
  and offspring density function for an (increasing) sequence of event times.
  Calculate the Rosenblatt residuals of the event times. Predict
  future event times based on observed event times up to a given time.
