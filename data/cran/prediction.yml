version: 0.3.14
title: Tidy, Type-Safe 'prediction()' Methods
maintainer: Thomas J. Leeper
description: A one-function package containing 'prediction()', a type-safe alternative
  to 'predict()' that always returns a data frame. The 'summary()' method provides
  a data frame with average predictions, possibly over counterfactual versions of
  the data (a la the 'margins' command in 'Stata'). Marginal effect estimation is
  provided by the related package, 'margins' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins>.
  The package currently supports common model types (e.g., "lm", "glm") from the 'stats'
  package, as well as numerous other model classes from other add-on packages. See
  the README or main package documentation page for a complete listing.
