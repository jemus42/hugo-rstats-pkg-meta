title: Apply Two Fuzzy Numbers on a Monotone Function
maintainer: Abbas Parchami
description: One can easily draw the membership function of f(x,y) by package 'FuzzyNumbers.Ext.2'
  in which f(.,.) is supposed monotone and x and y are two fuzzy numbers. This work
  is possible using function f2apply() which is an extension of function fapply()
  from Package 'FuzzyNumbers' for two-variable monotone functions. Moreover, this
  package has the ability of computing the core, support and alpha-cuts of the fuzzy-valued
  final result.
