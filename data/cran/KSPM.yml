title: Kernel Semi-Parametric Models
maintainer: Catherine Schramm
description: To fit the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions. It allows
  multiple kernels and unlimited interactions in the same model. Coefficients are
  estimated by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood; penalization terms and hyperparameters
  are estimated by minimizing leave-one-out error. It includes predictions with confidence/prediction
  intervals, statistical tests for the significance of each kernel, a procedure for
  variable selection and graphical tools for diagnostics and interpretation of covariate
  effects. Currently it is implemented for continuous dependent variables. The package
  is based on the paper of Liu et al. (2007), <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00799.x>.
