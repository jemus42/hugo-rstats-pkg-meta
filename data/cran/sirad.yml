  Evapotranspiration
maintainer: Jedrzej S. Bojanowski
description: Calculating daily global solar radiation at horizontal surface using
  several well-known models (i.e. Angstrom-Prescott, Supit-Van Kappel, Hargreaves,
  Bristow and Campbell, and Mahmood-Hubbard), and model calibration based on ground-truth
  data, and (3) model auto-calibration. The FAO Penmann-Monteith equation to calculate
  evapotranspiration is also included.
