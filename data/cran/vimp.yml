title: Perform Inference on Algorithm-Agnostic Variable Importance
maintainer: Brian D. Williamson
description: |-
  Calculate point estimates of and valid confidence intervals for
  nonparametric, algorithm-agnostic variable importance measures in high and low dimensions,
  using flexible estimators of the underlying regression functions. For more information
  about the methods, please see Williamson et al. (Biometrics, 2020) and Williamson et al. (arXiv, 2020+) <arXiv:2004.03683>.
