title: Simulate Genotypes from the BN-PSD Admixture Model
maintainer: Alejandro Ochoa
description: The Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) admixture model has k intermediate
  subpopulations from which n individuals draw their alleles dictated by their individual-specific
  admixture proportions.  The BN-PSD model additionally imposes the Balding-Nichols
  (BN) allele frequency model to the intermediate populations, which therefore evolved
  independently from a common ancestral population T with subpopulation-specific FST
  (Wright's fixation index) parameters.  The BN-PSD model can be used to yield complex
  population structures.  Method described in Ochoa and Storey (2016) <doi:10.1101/083923>.
