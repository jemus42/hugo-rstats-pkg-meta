version: 0.0.1
title: Identify Zero-Inflated Distributions
maintainer: Lei Wang
description: |-
  Computes bootstrapped Monte Carlo estimate of p value of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and
  likelihood ratio test for zero-inflated count data, based on the work of Aldirawi et al. (2019)
  <doi:10.1109/BHI.2019.8834661>. With the package, user can also find tools to simulate
  random deviates from zero inflated or hurdle models and obtain  maximum likelihood estimate
  of unknown parameters in these models.
