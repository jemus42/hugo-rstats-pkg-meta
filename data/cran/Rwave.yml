title: Time-Frequency Analysis of 1-D Signals
maintainer: Jonathan M. Lees
description: |-
  A set of R functions which provide an
  environment for the Time-Frequency analysis of 1-D signals (and
  especially for the wavelet and Gabor transforms of noisy
  signals). It was originally written for Splus by Rene Carmona,
  Bruno Torresani, and Wen L. Hwang, first at the University of
  California at Irvine and then at Princeton University.  Credit
  should also be given to Andrea Wang whose functions on the
  dyadic wavelet transform are included. Rwave is based on the
  book: "Practical Time-Frequency Analysis: Gabor and Wavelet
  Transforms with an Implementation in S", by Rene Carmona, Wen
  L. Hwang and Bruno Torresani (1998, eBook ISBN:978008053942), Academic Press.
