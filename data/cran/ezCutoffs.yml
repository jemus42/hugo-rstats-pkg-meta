title: Fit Measure Cutoffs in SEM
maintainer: Bjarne Schmalbach
description: Calculate cutoff values for model fit measures used in structural equation
  modeling (SEM) by simulating and testing data sets (cf. Hu & Bentler, 1999 <doi:10.1080/10705519909540118>)
  with the same parameters (population model, number of observations, etc.) as the
  model under consideration.
