maintainer: Ulrike Groemping
description: |-
  Regular and non-regular Fractional Factorial 2-level designs
  can be created. Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional
  Factorial designs with 2-level factors are offered (main
  effects and interaction plots for all factors simultaneously,
  cube plot for looking at the simultaneous effects of three
  factors, full or half normal plot, alias structure in a more
  readable format than with the built-in function alias).
