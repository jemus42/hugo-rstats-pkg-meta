title: Database Preferences and Skyline Computation
maintainer: Patrick Roocks
description: |-
  Routines to select and visualize the maxima for a given strict
  partial order. This especially includes the computation of the Pareto
  frontier, also known as (Top-k) Skyline operator (see Börzsönyi, et al.
  (2001) <doi:10.1109/ICDE.2001.914855>), and some generalizations
  known as database preferences (see Kießling (2002)
  <doi:10.1016/B978-155860869-6/50035-4>).
