  Sparse and Non-Sparse Partial Robust M Regression and
  Classification
maintainer: Irene Hoffmann
description: Robust dimension reduction methods for regression and discriminant analysis
  are implemented that yield estimates with a partial least squares alike interpretability.
  Partial robust M regression (PRM) is robust to both vertical outliers and leverage
  points. Sparse partial robust M regression (SPRM) is a related robust method with
  sparse coefficient estimate, and therefore with intrinsic variable selection. For
  binary classification related discriminant methods are PRM-DA and SPRM-DA.
