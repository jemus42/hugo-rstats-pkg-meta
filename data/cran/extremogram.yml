title: Estimation of Extreme Value Dependence for Time Series Data
maintainer: Nadezda Frolova
description: Estimation of the sample univariate, cross and return time extremograms.
  The package can also adds empirical confidence bands to each of the extremogram
  plots via a permutation procedure under the assumption that the data are independent.
  Finally, the stationary bootstrap allows us to construct credible confidence bands
  for the extremograms.
