  Test for Monotonicity in Expected Asset Returns, Sorted by
  Portfolios
maintainer: Siegfried KÃ¶stlmeier
description: Test for monotonicity in financial variables sorted by portfolios. It
  is conventional practice in empirical research to form portfolios of assets ranked
  by a certain sort variable. A t-test is then used to consider the mean return spread
  between the portfolios with the highest and lowest values of the sort variable.
  Yet comparing only the average returns on the top and bottom portfolios does not
  provide a sufficient way to test for a monotonic relation between expected returns
  and the sort variable. This package provides nonparametric tests for the full set
  of monotonic patterns by Patton, A. and Timmermann, A. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.06.006>
  and compares the proposed results with extant alternatives such as t-tests, Bonferroni
  bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations.
