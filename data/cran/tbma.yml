title: Tree-Based Moving Average Forecasting Model
maintainer: Burakhan Sel
description: We provide a forecasting model for time series forecasting problems with
  predictors. The offered model, which is based on a submitted research and called
  tree-based moving average (TBMA),  is based on the integration of the moving average
  approach to tree-based ensemble approach.  The tree-based ensemble models can capture
  the complex correlations between the predictors and response variable but lack in
  modelling time series components. The integration of the moving average approach
  to the tree-based ensemble approach helps the TBMA model to handle both correlations
  and autocorrelations in time series data. This package provides a tbma() forecasting
  function that utilizes the ranger() function from the 'ranger' package. With the
  help of the ranger() function, various types of tree-based ensemble models, such
  as extremely randomized trees and random forests, can be used in the TBMA model.
