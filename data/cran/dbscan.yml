  Density Based Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and
  Related Algorithms
maintainer: Michael Hahsler
description: |-
  A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of
  the DBSCAN family for spatial data. Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial
  clustering of applications with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to identify
  the clustering structure) clustering algorithms HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN) and the LOF (local outlier
  factor) algorithm. The implementations use the kd-tree data structure (from
  library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN
  and fixed-radius NN search is also provided.
