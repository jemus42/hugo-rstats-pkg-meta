title: Analyze High-Dimensional Data Using Discrete Morse Theory
maintainer: Paul Pearson
description: |-
  Topological Data Analysis using Mapper (discrete Morse theory).
  Generate a 1-dimensional simplicial complex from a filter
  function defined on the data:  1. Define a filter function (lens) on the
  data.  2. Perform clustering within within each level set and generate
  one node (vertex) for each cluster.  3. For each pair of clusters in
  adjacent level sets with a nonempty intersection, generate one edge
  between vertices.  The function mapper1D uses a filter function with
  codomain R, while the the function mapper2D uses a filter function with
  codomain R^2.
