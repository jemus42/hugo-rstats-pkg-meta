version: 0.2.5.2
title: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) using CUDA
maintainer: Sven Koitka
description: |-
  Wrapper package for the nmfgpu library, which implements several
  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms for CUDA platforms.
  By using the acceleration of GPGPU computing, the NMF can be used for
  real-world problems inside the R environment. All CUDA devices starting with
  Kepler architecture are supported by the library.
