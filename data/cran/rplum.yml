title: Bayesian Age-Depth Modelling of '210Pb'-Dated Cores
maintainer: Maarten Blaauw
description: An approach to age-depth modelling that uses Bayesian statistics to reconstruct
  accumulation histories for '210Pb'-dated deposits using prior information. It can
  combine '210Pb', radiocarbon, and other dates in the chronologies. See Aquino 'et'
  'al.' (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0328-7>. Note that parts of the code underlying
  'rplum' are derived from the 'rbacon' package by the same authors. Subsequent versions
  of 'rplum' and 'rbacon' are planned to reduce duplication, with 'rplum' importing
  'rbacon' instead.
