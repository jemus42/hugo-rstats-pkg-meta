  Nonparametric Estimation of Regression Models with
  Factor-by-Curve Interactions
maintainer: Marta Sestelo
description: |-
  A method for obtaining nonparametric estimates of regression models
  with or without factor-by-curve interactions using local polynomial kernel
  smoothers or splines. Additionally, a parametric model (allometric model) can be
  estimated.
