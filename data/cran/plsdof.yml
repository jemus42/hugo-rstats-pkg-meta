  Degrees of Freedom and Statistical Inference for Partial Least
  Squares Regression
maintainer: Frederic Bertrand
description: |-
  The plsdof package provides Degrees of Freedom estimates
  for Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression. Model selection for
  PLS is based on various information criteria (aic, bic, gmdl)
  or on cross-validation. Estimates for the mean and covariance
  of the PLS regression coefficients are available. They allow
  the construction of approximate confidence intervals and the
  application of test procedures. Further, cross-validation
  procedures for Ridge Regression and Principal Components
  Regression are available.
