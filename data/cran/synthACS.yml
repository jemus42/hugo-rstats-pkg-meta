  Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS
  Data
maintainer: Alex Whitworth
description: |-
  Provides access to curated American Community Survey (ACS) base tables via a wrapper
  to library(acs). Builds synthetic micro-datasets at any user-specified geographic level with
  ten default attributes; and, conducts spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM) via simulated
  annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by default. Lastly, we provide functionality for
  data-extensibility of micro-datasets.
