  Stability Parameters
maintainer: B. C. Ajay
description: |-
  Computes various stability parameters from Additive Main Effects
  and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis results such as  Modified
  AMMI Stability Value (MASV), Sums of the Absolute Value of the Interaction
  Principal Component Scores (SIPC), Sum Across Environments of
  Genotype-Environment Interaction Modelled by AMMI (AMGE), Sum Across
  Environments of Absolute Value of Genotype-Environment Interaction Modelled
  by AMMI (AV_(AMGE)), AMMI Stability Index (ASI), Modified ASI (MASI), AMMI
  Based Stability Parameter (ASTAB), Annicchiarico's D Parameter (DA), Zhang's
  D Parameter (DZ), Averages of the Squared Eigenvector Values (EV), Stability
  Measure Based on Fitted AMMI Model (FA), Absolute Value of the Relative
  Contribution of IPCs to the Interaction (Za). Further calculates the
  Simultaneous Selection Index for Yield and Stability from the computed
  stability parameters. See the vignette for complete list of citations for
  the methods implemented.
