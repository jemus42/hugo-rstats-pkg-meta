title: Jack, Zonal, and Schur Polynomials
maintainer: St√©phane Laurent
description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials, zonal polynomials,
  and Schur polynomials. Mainly based on Demmel & Koev's paper (2006) <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1>.
  Zonal polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack polynomials.
  Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur polynomials appear in the
  field of combinatorics.
