  Parameter Estimation in Linear Transformation Model with
  Interval-Censored Data and Covariate Measurement Error
maintainer: Soutrik Mandal
description: Estimates the parameters of the semiparametric linear transformation
  model using imputation method, naive method and regression calibration method when
  time-to-event is interval-censored and a covariate is measured with error. A right
  censoring indicator must be available. The methods implemented in this package can
  be found in Mandal, S., Wang, S. and Sinha, S. (2019+). Analysis of Linear Transformation
  Models with Covariate Measurement Error and Interval Censoring. (accepted, Statistics
  In Medicine).
