title: Polygon Clipping
maintainer: Adrian Baddeley
description: R port of Angus Johnson's open source library Clipper. Performs polygon
  clipping operations (intersection, union, set minus, set difference) for polygonal
  regions of arbitrary complexity, including holes. Computes offset polygons (spatial
  buffer zones, morphological dilations, Minkowski dilations) for polygonal regions
  and polygonal lines. Computes Minkowski Sum of general polygons. There is a function
  for removing self-intersections from polygon data.
