title: Match One Sample using Two Criteria
maintainer: Bo Zhang
description: |-
  Multivariate matching in observational studies typically has two goals: 1. to construct
  treated and control groups that have similar distribution of observed covariates and 2. to produce
  matched pairs or sets that are homogeneous in a few priority variables. This packages implements a
  network-based method built around a tripartite graph that can simultaneously achieve both goals. A
  detailed 'RMarkdown' tutorial can be found at <https://github.com/bzhangupenn/match2C/tree/master/tutorial>.
