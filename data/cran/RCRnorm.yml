  An Integrated Regression Model for Normalizing 'NanoString
  nCounter' Data
maintainer: Gaoxiang Jia
description: '''NanoString nCounter'' is a medium-throughput platform that measures
  gene or microRNA expression levels. Here is a publication that introduces this platform:
  Malkov (2009) <doi:10.1186/1756-0500-2-80>. Here is the webpage of ''NanoString
  nCounter'' where you can find detailed information about this platform <https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/ncounter-technology>.
  It has great clinical application, such as diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Implements
  integrated system of random-coefficient hierarchical regression model to normalize
  data from ''NanoString nCounter'' platform so that noise from various sources can
  be removed.'
