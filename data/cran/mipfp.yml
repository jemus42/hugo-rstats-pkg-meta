  Multidimensional Iterative Proportional Fitting and Alternative
  Models
maintainer: Johan Barthelemy
description: |-
  An implementation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPFP),
  maximum likelihood, minimum chi-square and weighted least squares procedures
  for updating a N-dimensional array with respect to given target marginal
  distributions (which, in turn can be multidimensional). The package also
  provides an application of the IPFP to simulate multivariate Bernoulli
  distributions.
