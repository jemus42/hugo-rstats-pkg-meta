title: Matched Samples that are Balanced and Representative by Design
maintainer: Jose R. Zubizarreta
description: Includes functions for the construction of matched samples that are balanced
  and representative by design.  Among others, these functions can be used for matching
  in observational studies with treated and control units, with cases and controls,
  in related settings with instrumental variables, and in discontinuity designs.  Also,
  they can be used for the design of randomized experiments, for example, for matching
  before randomization.  By default, 'designmatch' uses the 'GLPK' optimization solver,
  but its performance is greatly enhanced by the 'Gurobi' optimization solver and
  its associated R interface.  For their installation, please follow the instructions
  at <http://user.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-optimizer> and <http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.0/refman/r_api_overview.html>.  We
  have also included directions in the gurobi_installation file in the inst folder.
