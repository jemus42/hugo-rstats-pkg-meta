title: Binary and Categorical Image Similarity Index
maintainer: Geoffrey Thompson
description: |-
  Computes a structural similarity metric (after the style of
  MS-SSIM for images) for binary and categorical 2D and 3D images. Can be
  based on accuracy (simple matching), Cohen's kappa, Rand index, adjusted
  Rand index, Jaccard index, Dice index, normalized mutual information, or
  adjusted mutual information. In addition, has fast computation
  of Cohen's kappa, the Rand indices, and the two mutual informations.
  Implements the methods of Thompson and Maitra (2020) <arXiv:2004.09073>.
