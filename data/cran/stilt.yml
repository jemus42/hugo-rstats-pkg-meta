title: Separable Gaussian Process Interpolation (Emulation)
maintainer: Kelsey Ruckert
description: Functions for simplified emulation of time series computer model output
  in model parameter space using Gaussian processes. Stilt can be used more generally
  for Kriging of spatio-temporal fields. There are functions to predict at new parameter
  settings, to test the emulator using cross-validation (which includes information
  on 95% confidence interval empirical coverage), and to produce contour plots over
  2D slices in model parameter space.
