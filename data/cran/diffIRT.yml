title: Diffusion IRT Models for Response and Response Time Data
maintainer: Dylan Molenaar
description: |-
  Package to fit diffusion-based IRT models to response and
  response time data. Models are fit using marginal maximum
  likelihood. Parameter restrictions (fixed value and equality
  constraints) are possible. In addition, factor scores (person drift
  rate and person boundary separation) can be estimated. Model fit
  assessment tools are also available. The traditional diffusion model
  can be estimated as well.
