title: Sensitivity Analysis for Full Matching in Observational Studies
maintainer: Paul R. Rosenbaum
description: Sensitivity to unmeasured biases in an observational study that is a
  full match.  Function senfm() performs tests and function senfmCI() creates confidence
  intervals.  The method uses Huber's M-statistics, including least squares, and is
  described in Rosenbaum (2007, Biometrics) <DOI:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00717.x>.
