  Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM)
  Algorithm
maintainer: Emmanuelle Comets
description: 'The SAEMIX package implements the Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm
  for parameter estimation in (non)linear mixed effects models. The SAEM algorithm:
  - computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the population parameters, without
  any approximation of the model (linearisation, quadrature approximation,...), using
  the Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, - provides
  standard errors for the maximum likelihood estimator - estimates the conditional
  modes, the conditional means and the conditional standard deviations of the individual
  parameters, using the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm. Several applications of SAEM
  in agronomy, animal breeding and PKPD analysis have been published by members of
  the Monolix group (<http://group.monolix.org/>).'
