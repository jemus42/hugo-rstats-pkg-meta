title: Hierarchical Bayesian Vector Autoregression
maintainer: Nikolas Kuschnig
description: |-
  Estimation of hierarchical Bayesian vector autoregressive models.
  Implements hierarchical prior selection for conjugate priors in the fashion
  of Giannone, Lenza & Primiceri (2015) <doi:10.1162/REST_a_00483>. Functions
  to compute and identify impulse responses, calculate forecasts,
  forecast error variance decompositions and scenarios are available.
  Several methods to print, plot and summarise results facilitate analysis.
