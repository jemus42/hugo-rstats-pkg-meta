title: The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model
maintainer: Venelin Mitov
description: |-
  The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model (POUMM) allows to
  estimate the phylogenetic heritability of continuous traits, to test
  hypotheses of neutral evolution versus stabilizing selection, to quantify
  the strength of stabilizing selection, to estimate measurement error and to
  make predictions about the evolution of a phenotype and phenotypic variation
  in a population. The package implements combined maximum likelihood and
  Bayesian inference of the univariate Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed
  Model, fast parallel likelihood calculation, maximum likelihood
  inference of the genotypic values at the tips, functions for summarizing and
  plotting traces and posterior samples, functions for simulation of a univariate
  continuous trait evolution model along a phylogenetic tree. So far, the
  package has been used for estimating the heritability of quantitative traits
  in macroevolutionary and epidemiological studies, see e.g.
  Bertels et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/molbev/msx246> and
  Mitov and Stadler (2018) <doi:10.1093/molbev/msx328>. The algorithm for
  parallel POUMM likelihood calculation has been published in
  Mitov and Stadler (2019) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13136>.
