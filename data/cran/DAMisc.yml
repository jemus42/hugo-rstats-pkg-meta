title: Dave Armstrong's Miscellaneous Functions
maintainer: Dave Armstrong
description: Miscellaneous set of functions I use in my teaching either at the University
  of Western Ontario or the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
  (ICPSR) Summer Program in Quantitative Methods.  Broadly, the functions help with
  presentation and interpretation of LMs and GLMs, but also implement some new tools
  like Alternating Least Squares Optimal Scaling for dependent variables, a Bayesian
  analog to the ALSOS algorithm.  There are also tools to help understand interactions
  in both LMs and binary GLMs.
