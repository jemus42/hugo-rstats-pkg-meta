title: Finite Mixture of Multivariate Censored/Missing Data
maintainer: Francisco H. C. de Alencar
description: It fits finite mixture models for censored or/and missing data using
  several multivariate distributions. Point estimation and asymptotic inference (via
  empirical information matrix) are offered as well as censored data generation. Pairwise
  scatter and contour plots can be generated. Possible multivariate distributions
  are the well-known normal, Student-t and skew-normal distributions. This package
  is an complement of Lachos, V. H., Moreno, E. J. L., Chen, K. & Cabral, C. R. B.
  (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2017.05.005> for the multivariate skew-normal case.
