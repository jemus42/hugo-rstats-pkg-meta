title: Tools to Generate Vector Time Series
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  A method 'generate()' is implemented in this package for the random
  generation of vector time series according to models obtained by 'RMAWGEN',
  'vars' or other packages.  This package was created to generalize the
  algorithms of the 'RMAWGEN' package for the analysis and generation of any
  environmental vector time series.
