  Response
maintainer: Michael C Sachs
description: |-
  Contains the core methods for the evaluation of principal
  surrogates in a single clinical trial. Provides a flexible interface for
  defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate, the models
  for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses, and the
  estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be used
  for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation
  summary methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing.
