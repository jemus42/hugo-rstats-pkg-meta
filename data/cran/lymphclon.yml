  Accurate Estimation of Clonal Coincidences and Abundances from
  Biological Replicates
maintainer: Yi Liu
description: We provide a clonality score estimator that takes full advantage of the
  multi-biological-replicate structure of modern sequencing experiments; it specifically
  takes into account the reality that, typically, the clonal coverage is well below
  0.1%.
