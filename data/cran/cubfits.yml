title: Codon Usage Bias Fits
maintainer: Wei-Chen Chen
description: |-
  Estimating mutation and selection coefficients on synonymous
  codon bias usage based on models of ribosome overhead cost (ROC).
  Multinomial logistic regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo are used to
  estimate and predict protein production rates with/without the presence
  of expressions and measurement errors. Work flows with examples for
  simulation, estimation and prediction processes are also provided
  with parallelization speedup. The whole framework is tested with
  yeast genome and gene expression data of Yassour, et al. (2009)
