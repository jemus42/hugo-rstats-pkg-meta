title: Some Empiric and Nonparametric Copula Models
maintainer: Oskar Laverny
description: 'Provides S4 classes and methods to fit several copula models: The classic
  empirical checkerboard copula and the empirical checkerboard copula with known margins,
  see Cuberos, Masiello and Maume-Deschamps (2019) <doi:10.1080/03610926.2019.1586936>
  are proposed. These two models allow to fit copulas in high dimension with a small
  number of observations, and they are always proper copulas. Some flexibility is
  added via a possibility to differentiate the checkerboard parameter by dimension.
  The last model consist of the implementation of the Copula Recursive Tree algorithm
  proposed by Laverny, Maume-Deschamps, Masiello and Rulli√®re (2020) <arXiv:2005.02912>,
  including the localised dimension reduction, which fits a copula by recursive splitting
  of the copula domain. We also provide an efficient way of mixing copulas, allowing
  to bag the algorithm into a forest, and a generic way of measuring d-dimensional
  boxes with a copula.'
