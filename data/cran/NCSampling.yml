title: Nearest Centroid (NC) Sampling
maintainer: Gavin Melville
description: Provides functionality for performing Nearest Centroid (NC) Sampling.
  The NC sampling procedure was developed for forestry applications and selects plots
  for ground measurement so as to maximize the efficiency of imputation estimates.
  It uses multiple auxiliary variables and multivariate clustering to search for an
  optimal sample. Further details are given in Melville G. & Stone C. (2016) <doi:10.1080/00049158.2016.1218265>.
