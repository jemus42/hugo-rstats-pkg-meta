title: Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan'
maintainer: Paul-Christian Bürkner
description: |-
  Fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models
  using 'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. A wide range of distributions
  and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit -- among others --
  linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal,
  zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a
  multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and
  smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic
  standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the
  response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional
  regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage
  users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
  Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive
  checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. References: Bürkner (2017)
