title: Contextualization and Evaluation of COI-5P Barcode Data
maintainer: Cameron M. Nugent
description: |-
  Designed for the cleaning, contextualization and assessment of cytochrome c
  oxidase I DNA barcode data (COI-5P, or the five prime portion of COI). It contains
  functions for placing COI-5P barcode sequences into a common reading frame,
  translating DNA sequences to amino acids and for assessing the likelihood that a
  given barcode sequence includes an insertion or deletion error. The error assessment
  relies on the comparison of input sequences against nucleotide and amino acid profile
  hidden Markov models (PHMMs) (for details see Durbin et al. 1998, ISBN: 9780521629713)
  trained on a taxonomically diverse set of reference sequences. The functions are
  provided as a complete pipeline and are also available individually for efficient and
  targeted analysis of barcode data.
