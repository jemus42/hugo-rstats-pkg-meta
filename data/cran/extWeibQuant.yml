title: Estimate Lower Extreme Quantile with the Censored Weibull MLE<U+000a>and Censored
  Weibull Mixture
maintainer: Yang (Seagle) Liu
description: It implements the subjectively censored Weibull MLE and censored Weibull
  mixture methods for the lower quantile estimation. Quantile estimates from these
  two methods are robust to model misspecification in the lower tail. It also includes
  functions to evaluation the standard error of the resulting quantile estimates.
  Also, the methods here can be used to fit the Weibull or Weibull mixture for the
  Type-I or Type-II right censored data.
