title: Identify Event Sequences Using Time Series Joins
maintainer: Mark Sendak
description: |-
  Examine any number of time series data frames to identify
  instances in which various criteria are met within specified time
  frames. In clinical medicine, these types of events are often
  called "constellations of signs and symptoms", because a single
  condition depends on a series of events occurring within a certain
  amount of time of each other. This package was written to work with
  any number of time series data frames and is optimized for speed
  to work well with data frames with millions of rows.
