title: '''Rcpp'' Interface to the APT Package Manager'
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The 'APT Package Management System' provides Debian and
  Debian-derived Linux systems with a powerful system to resolve package
  dependencies. This package offers access directly from R.  This can
  only work on a system with a suitable 'libapt-pkg-dev' installation
  so functionality is curtailed if such a library is not found.
