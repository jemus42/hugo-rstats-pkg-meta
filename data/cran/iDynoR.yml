title: R Analysis package for iDynoMiCS Simulation Results
maintainer: Kieran Alden
description: 'iDynoMiCS is a computer program, developed by an international team
  of researchers, whose purpose is to model and simulate microbial communities in
  an individual-based way. It is described in detail in the paper "iDynoMiCS: next-generation
  individual-based modelling of biofilms" by Lardon et al, published in Environmental
  Microbiology in 2011. The simulation produces results in XML file format, describing
  the state of each species in each timestep (agent_State), a summary of the species
  statistics for a timepoint (agent_Sum), the state of each solute grid in each timestep
  (env_State) and a summary of the solutes for a timestep (env_Sum). This R package
  provides a means of reading this XML data into R such that the simulation response
  can be statistically analysed. iDynoMiCS is available from the website iDynoMiCS.org,
  where a full tutorial on using both the simulation and this R package is provided.'
