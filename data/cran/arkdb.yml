title: Archive and Unarchive Databases Using Flat Files
maintainer: Carl Boettiger
description: |-
  Flat text files provide a robust, compressible, and portable
  way to store tables from databases.  This package provides convenient
  functions for exporting tables from relational database connections
  into compressed text files and streaming those text files back into
  a database without requiring the whole table to fit in working memory.
