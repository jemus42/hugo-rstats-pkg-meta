title: Manipulation of Linear Systems of (in)Equalities
maintainer: Mark van der Loo
description: |-
  Variable elimination (Gaussian elimination, Fourier-Motzkin elimination),
  Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, reduction to reduced row echelon form, value substitution,
  projecting a vector on the convex polytope described by a system of (in)equations,
  simplify systems by removing spurious columns and rows and collapse implied equalities,
  test if a matrix is totally unimodular, compute variable ranges implied by linear
  (in)equalities.
