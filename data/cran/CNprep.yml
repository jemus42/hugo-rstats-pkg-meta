title: Pre-process DNA Copy Number (CN) Data for Detection of CN Events
maintainer: Guoli Sun
description: This package evaluates DNA copy number data, using both their initial
  form (copy number as a noisy function of genomic position) and their approximation
  by a piecewise-constant function (segmentation), for the purpose of identifying
  genomic regions where the copy number differs from the norm.
