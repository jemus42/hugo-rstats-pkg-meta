title: Incomplete Block Designs
maintainer: B N Mandal
description: A collection of several utility functions related to binary incomplete
  block designs. The package contains function to generate A- and D-efficient binary
  incomplete block designs with given numbers of treatments, number of blocks and
  block size. The package also contains function to generate an incomplete block design
  with specified concurrence matrix. There are functions to generate balanced treatment
  incomplete block designs and incomplete block designs for test versus control treatments
  comparisons with specified concurrence matrix. Package also allows performing analysis
  of variance of data and computing estimated marginal means of factors from experiments
  using a connected incomplete block design. Tests of hypothesis of treatment contrasts
  in incomplete block design set up is supported.
