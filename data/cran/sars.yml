  Fit and Compare Species-Area Relationship Models Using
  Multimodel Inference
maintainer: Thomas J. Matthews
description: |-
  Implements the basic elements of the multi-model
  inference paradigm for up to twenty species-area relationship models (SAR), using simple
  R list-objects and functions, as in Triantis et al. 2012 <DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02652.x>.
  The package is scalable and users can easily create their own model and data objects. Additional
  SAR related functions are provided.
