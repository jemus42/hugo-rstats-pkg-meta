  Examine Measurement Invariance via Equivalence Testing and
  Projection Method
maintainer: Ge Jiang
description: Functions for examining measurement invariance via equivalence testing
  along with adjusted RMSEA(root mean square error of approximation; Steiger & Lind,
  1980) cutoff values. In particular, a projection-based method is implemented to
  test the equality of latent factor means across groups without assuming the equality
  of intercepts.
