title: Bayesian Model Averaging Library
maintainer: Stefan Zeugner
description: Bayesian model averaging for linear models with a wide choice of (customizable)
  priors. Built-in priors include coefficient priors (fixed, flexible and hyper-g
  priors), 5 kinds of model priors, moreover model sampling by enumeration or various
  MCMC approaches. Post-processing functions allow for inferring posterior inclusion
  and model probabilities, various moments, coefficient and predictive densities.
  Plotting functions available for posterior model size, MCMC convergence, predictive
  and coefficient densities, best models representation, BMA comparison.
