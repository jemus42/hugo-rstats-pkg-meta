  Functions for timing R scripts, as well as implementations of
  Stack and List structures.
maintainer: Sergei Izrailev
description: |-
  This package provides the timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that
  can be nested. One can record all timings while a complex script is
  running, and examine the values later. It is also possible to instrument
  the timing calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this package provides
  class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'List', implemented as a
  list, both of which support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first', 'last' and
  'clear'.
