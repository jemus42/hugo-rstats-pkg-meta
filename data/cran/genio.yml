version: 1.0.12
title: Genetics Input/Output Functions
maintainer: Alejandro Ochoa
description: Implements readers and writers for file formats associated with genetics
  data.  Reading and writing plink BED/BIM/FAM formats is fully supported, including
  a lightning-fast BED reader and writer implementations.  Other functions are 'readr'
  wrappers that are more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient for these particular
  applications; handles plink and eigenstrat tables (FAM, BIM, IND, and SNP files).  There
  are also "make" functions for FAM and BIM tables with default values to go with
  simulated genotype data.
