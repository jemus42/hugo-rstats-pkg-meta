title: An Implementation of Flower Pollination Algorithm in R
maintainer: Amanda Pratama Putra
description: |-
  A nature-inspired metaheuristics algorithm based on the pollination
  process of flowers. This R package makes it easy to implement the standard
  flower pollination algorithm for every user. The algorithm was first developed
  by Xin-She Yang in 2012 (<DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-32894-7_27>).
