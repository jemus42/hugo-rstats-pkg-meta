description: |-
  Toolbox for chemometrics analysis of bidimensional gas
  chromatography data. This package import data for common scientific data
  format (NetCDF) and fold it to 2D chromatogram. Then, it can perform
  preprocessing and multivariate analysis. In the preprocessing algorithms,
  baseline correction, smoothing, and peak alignment are available.
  While in multivariate analysis, multiway principal component analysis is
  incorporated.
