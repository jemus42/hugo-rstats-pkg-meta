  Visualizing and Analyzing Mass Spectrometry Related Data in
  Proteomics
maintainer: Christian Panse
description: |-
  Helps with quality checks, visualizations
  and analysis of mass spectrometry data, coming from proteomics
  experiments. The package is developed, tested and used at the Functional
  Genomics Center Zurich <https://fgcz.ch>. We use this package
  mainly for prototyping, teaching, and having fun with proteomics data.
  But it can also be used to do data analysis for small scale data sets.
