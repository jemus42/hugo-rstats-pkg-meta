  Early Testing for a Treatment Effect using Surrogate Marker
  Information
maintainer: Layla Parast
description: 'Provides functions to test for a treatment effect in terms of the difference
  in survival between a treatment group and a control group using surrogate marker
  information obtained at some early time point in a time-to-event outcome setting.
  Nonparametric kernel estimation is used to estimate the test statistic and perturbation
  resampling is used for variance estimation. More details will be available in the
  future in: Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2019). Using a Surrogate Marker for Early Testing
  of a Treatment Effect. Biometrics, In press.'
