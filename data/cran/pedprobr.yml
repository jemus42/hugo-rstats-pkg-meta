description: |-
  An implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for calculating
  pedigree likelihoods given genetic marker data (Elston and Stewart (1971)
  <doi:10.1159/000152448>). The standard algorithm is extended to allow inbred
  founders. Mutation modelling is supported by the 'pedmut' package. 'pedprobr'
  is part of the ped suite, a collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R,
  based on 'pedtools' for handling pedigrees and markers.
