title: Interface to Diverse Estimation Methods of Causal Networks
maintainer: Christina Heinze-Deml
description: |-
  Unified interface for the estimation of causal networks, including
  the methods 'backShift' (from package 'backShift'), 'bivariateANM' (bivariate
  additive noise model), 'bivariateCAM' (bivariate causal additive model),
  'CAM' (causal additive model) (from package 'CAM'; the package is
  temporarily unavailable on the CRAN repository; formerly available versions
  can be obtained from the archive), 'hiddenICP' (invariant
  causal prediction with hidden variables), 'ICP' (invariant causal prediction)
  (from package 'InvariantCausalPrediction'), 'GES' (greedy equivalence
  search), 'GIES' (greedy interventional equivalence search), 'LINGAM', 'PC' (PC
  Algorithm), 'FCI' (fast causal inference),
  'RFCI' (really fast causal inference) (all from package 'pcalg') and
  regression.
