  High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational
  Mathematics
maintainer: Joseph Wood
description: |-
  Provides optimized functions and flexible combinatorial iterators
  implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp' for solving problems in combinatorics and
  computational mathematics. Utilizes parallel programming via 'RcppThread'
  for maximal performance. Also makes use of the RMatrix class from the
  'RcppParallel' library. There are combination/permutation functions with
  constraint parameters that allow for generation of all results of a vector
  meeting specific criteria (e.g. generating integer partitions/compositions
  or finding all combinations such that the sum is between two bounds).
  Capable of generating specific combinations/permutations (e.g. retrieve
  only the nth lexicographical result) which sets up nicely for
  parallelization as well as random sampling. Gmp support permits exploration
  where the total number of results is large (e.g. comboSample(10000, 500,
  n = 4)). Additionally, there are several high performance number theoretic
  functions that are useful for problems common in computational mathematics.
  Some of these functions make use of the fast integer division library
  'libdivide'. The primeSieve function is based on the segmented sieve of
  Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch. It is also efficient for large
  numbers by using the cache friendly improvements originally developed by
  Tom√°s Oliveira. Finally, there is a prime counting function that implements
  Legendre's formula based on the work of Kim Walisch.
