  Searching for Footprints of Selection using 'Extended Haplotype
  Homozygosity' Based Tests
maintainer: Alexander Klassmann
description: |-
  Population genetic data such as 'Single Nucleotide
  Polymorphisms' (SNPs) is often used to identify genomic regions
  that have been under recent natural or artificial selection
  and might provide clues about the molecular mechanisms of adaptation.
  One approach, the concept of an 'Extended Haplotype Homozygosity' (EHH),
  introduced by (Sabeti 2002) <doi:10.1038/nature01140>, has given rise to
  several statistics designed for whole genome scans.
  The package provides functions to compute three of these,
  namely: 'iHS' (Voight 2006) <doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072> for
  detecting positive or 'Darwinian' selection within a single population as well as
  'Rsb' (Tang 2007) <doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050171> and
  'XP-EHH' (Sabeti 2007) <doi:10.1038/nature06250>, targeted
  at differential selection between two populations.
  Various plotting functions are also included to facilitate
  visualization and interpretation of these statistics.
  Due to changes in the API, albeit mostly minor,
  versions 3.X are not compatible with versions 2.0.X.
