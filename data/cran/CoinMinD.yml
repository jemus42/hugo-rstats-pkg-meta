title: Simultaneous Confidence Interval for Multinomial Proportion
maintainer: Sumathi
description: Methods for obtaining simultaneous confidence interval for<U+000a>multinomial
  proportion have been proposed by many authors and<U+000a>the present study include
  a variety of widely applicable<U+000a>procedures. Seven classical methods (Wilson,
  Quesenberry and<U+000a>Hurst, Goodman, Wald with and without continuity correction,<U+000a>Fitzpatrick
  and Scott, Sison and Glaz) and Bayesian Dirichlet<U+000a>models are included in
  the package. The advantage of MCMC pack<U+000a>has been exploited to derive the
  Dirichlet posterior directly<U+000a>and this also helps in handling the Dirichlet
  prior parameters.<U+000a>This package is prepared to have equal and unequal values
  for<U+000a>the Dirichlet prior distribution that will provide better scope<U+000a>for
  data analysis and associated sensitivity analysis.
