version: 0.0.13
title: R Interface to the Vowpal Wabbit
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The 'Vowpal Wabbit' project is a fast out-of-core learning
  system sponsored by Microsoft Research (having started at Yahoo! Research)
  and written by John Langford along with a number of contributors. This R
  package does not include the distributed computing implementation of the
  cluster/ directory of the upstream sources. Use of the software as a network
  service is also not directly supported as the aim is a simpler direct call
  from R for validation and comparison. Note that this package contains an
  embedded older version of 'Vowpal Wabbit'. The package 'rvw' at the GitHub
  repo <https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rvw> can provide an alternative using
  an external 'Vowpal Wabbit' library installation.
