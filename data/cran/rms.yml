description: "Regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation,\ngraphics, prediction,
  and typesetting by storing enhanced model design\nattributes in the fit.  'rms'
  is a collection of functions that\nassist with and streamline modeling.  It also
  contains functions for\nbinary and ordinal logistic regression models, ordinal models
  for\ncontinuous Y with a variety of distribution families, and the Buckley-James\nmultiple
  regression model for right-censored responses, and implements\npenalized maximum
  likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary\nlinear models.  'rms' works with
  almost any regression model, but it\nwas especially written to work with binary
  or ordinal regression\nmodels, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models,\nordinary
  linear models,\tthe Buckley-James model, generalized least\nsquares for serially
  or spatially correlated observations, generalized\nlinear models, and quantile regression."
