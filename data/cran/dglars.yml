title: Differential Geometric Least Angle Regression
maintainer: Luigi Augugliaro
description: Differential geometric least angle regression method for fitting sparse
  generalized linear models. In this version of the package, the user can fit models
  specifying Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and Inverse Gaussian family. Furthermore,
  several link functions can be used to model the relationship between the conditional
  expected value of the response variable and the linear predictor. The solution curve
  can be computed using an efficient predictor-corrector or a cyclic coordinate descent
  algorithm, as described in the paper linked to via the URL below.
