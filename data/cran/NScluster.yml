description: |-
  Simulation and estimation for Neyman-Scott spatial cluster point
  process models and their extensions, based on the methodology in Tanaka, Ogata,
  and Stoyan (2008) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200610339>. To estimate parameters by the
  simplex method, parallel computation using 'OpenMP' application programming
  interface is available.
