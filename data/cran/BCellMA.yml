title: B Cell Receptor Somatic Hyper Mutation Analysis
maintainer: Olena Ohlei
description: Includes a set of functions to analyze for instance nucleotide frequencies
  as well as transition and  transversion. Can reconstruct germline sequences based
  on the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT/HighV-QUEST) outputs,
  calculate and plot the difference (%) of nucleotides at 6 positions around a mutation
  to identify and characterize hotspot motifs as well as calculate and plot average
  mutation frequencies of nucleotide mutations resulting in amino acid substitution.
