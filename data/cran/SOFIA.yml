maintainer: Luis Diaz-Garcia
description: Software that leverages the capabilities of Circos by manipulating data,
  preparing configuration files, and running the Perl-native Circos directly from
  the R environment with minimal user intervention. Circos is a novel software that
  addresses the challenges in visualizing genetic data by creating circular ideograms
  composed of tracks of heatmaps, scatter plots, line plots, histograms, links between
  common markers, glyphs, text, and etc. Please see <http://www.circos.ca>.
