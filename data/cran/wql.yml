title: Exploring Water Quality Monitoring Data
maintainer: Joseph Stachelek
description: |-
  Functions to assist in the processing and
  exploration of data from environmental monitoring programs.
  The package name stands for "water quality" and reflects the
  original focus on time series data for physical and chemical
  properties of water, as well as the biota. Intended for
  programs that sample approximately monthly, quarterly or
  annually at discrete stations, a feature of many legacy data
  sets. Most of the functions should be useful for analysis of
  similar-frequency time series regardless of the subject
  matter.
