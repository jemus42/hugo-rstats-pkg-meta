title: Estimation of Large Block Covariance Matrices
maintainer: Marie Perrot-Dockès
description: |-
  Computation of large covariance matrices having a block structure up to a permutation of their columns and rows
  from a small number of samples with respect to the dimension of the matrix.
  The method is described in the paper Perrot-Dockès et al. (2019) <arXiv:1806.10093>.
