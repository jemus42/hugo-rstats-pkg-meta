  Easy-to-use interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the seasonal adjustment
  software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full access to almost all
  options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS, automatic ARIMA model
  search, outlier detection and support for user defined holiday variables,
  such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. A graphical user interface can be
  used through the 'seasonalview' package. Uses the X-13-binaries from the
  'x13binary' package.
