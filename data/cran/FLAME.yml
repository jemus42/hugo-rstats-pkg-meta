title: Interpretable Matching for Causal Inference
maintainer: Vittorio Orlandi
description: |-
  Efficient implementations of the algorithms in the
  Almost-Matching-Exactly framework for interpretable matching in causal
  inference. These algorithms match units via a learned, weighted Hamming
  distance that determines which covariates are more important to match on.
  For more information and examples, see the Almost-Matching-Exactly website.
