  Bayesian Inference from the Conditional Genetic Stock
  Identification Model
maintainer: Eric C. Anderson
description: |-
  Implements Bayesian inference for the conditional genetic
  stock identification model.  It allows inference of mixed fisheries and also
  simulation of mixtures to predict accuracy.  A full description of the underlying
  methods is available in a recently published article in the
  Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences: <doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0016>.
