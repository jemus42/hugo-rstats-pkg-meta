  Consistent Significance Controlled Variable Selection in Linear
  Regression
maintainer: Jongwook Kim
description: Provides significance controlled variable selection algorithms with different
  directions (forward, backward, stepwise) based on diverse criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted
  r-square, PRESS, or p-value). The algorithm selects a final model with only significant
  variables based on a correction choice of False Discovery Rate, Bonferroni, or no
  correction.
