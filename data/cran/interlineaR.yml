  Importing Interlinearized Corpora and Dictionaries as Produced
  by Descriptive Linguistics Software
maintainer: Sylvain Loiseau
description: |-
  Interlinearized glossed texts (IGT) are used in descriptive linguistics for
  representing a morphological analysis of a text through a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss.
  'InterlineaR' provide a set of functions that targets several popular formats of IGT
  ('SIL Toolbox', 'EMELD XML') and that turns an IGT into a set of data frames following
  a relational model (the tables represent the different linguistic units: texts,
  sentences, word, morphems).
  The same pieces of software ('SIL FLEX', 'SIL Toolbox') typically produce dictionaries
  of the morphemes used in the glosses. 'InterlineaR' provide a function for turning
  the LIFT XML dictionary format into a set of data frames following a relational model
  in order to represent the dictionary entries, the sense(s) attached to the entries,
  the example(s) attached to senses, etc.
