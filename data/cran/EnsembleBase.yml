  Extensible Package for Parallel, Batch Training of Base Learners
  for Ensemble Modeling
maintainer: Alireza S. Mahani
description: Extensible S4 classes and methods for batch training of regression and
  classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Neural
  Network, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Penalized Regression (L1/L2),
  and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. These algorithms constitute a set of 'base
  learners', which can subsequently be combined together to form ensemble predictions.
  This package provides cross-validation wrappers to allow for downstream application
  of ensemble integration techniques, including best-error selection. All base learner
  estimation objects are retained, allowing for repeated prediction calls without
  the need for re-training. For large problems, an option is provided to save estimation
  objects to disk, along with prediction methods that utilize these objects. This
  allows users to train and predict with large ensembles of base learners without
  being constrained by system RAM.
