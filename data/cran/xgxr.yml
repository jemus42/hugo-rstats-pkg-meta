version: 1.0.9
title: Exploratory Graphics for Pharmacometrics
maintainer: Andrew Stein
description: |-
  Supports a structured approach
  for exploring PKPD data <https://opensource.nibr.com/xgx>. It also
  contains helper functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R
  practices (by appending the program name, figure name location, and
  draft status to each plot). In addition, it enables the modeler to
  follow best graphical practices (by providing a theme that
  reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and
  reverse-log-transform-scale functions for more readable axes).
  Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing functions for
  rapidly exploring pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) datasets.
