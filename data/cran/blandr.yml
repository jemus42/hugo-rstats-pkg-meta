title: Bland-Altman Method Comparison
maintainer: Deepankar Datta
description: |-
  Carries out Bland Altman analyses (also known as a Tukey
  mean-difference plot) as described by JM Bland and DG Altman in
  1986 <doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8>. This package was created in
  2015 as existing Bland-Altman analysis functions did not calculate
  confidence intervals. This package was created to rectify this,
  and create reproducible plots. This package is also available as a module
  for the 'jamovi' statistical spreadsheet (see <https://www.jamovi.org>
  for more information).
