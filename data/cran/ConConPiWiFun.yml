  Optimisation with Continuous Convex Piecewise (Linear and
  Quadratic) Functions
maintainer: Robin Girard
description: Continuous convex piecewise linear (ccpl) resp. quadratic (ccpq) functions
  can be implemented with sorted breakpoints and slopes. This includes functions that
  are ccpl (resp. ccpq) on a convex set (i.e. an interval or a point) and infinite
  out of the domain. These functions can be very useful for a large class of optimisation
  problems. Efficient manipulation (such as log(N) insertion) of such data structure
  is obtained with map standard template library of C++ (that hides balanced trees).
  This package is a wrapper on such a class based on Rcpp modules.
