title: Widen, Process, then Re-Tidy Data
maintainer: David Robinson
description: |-
  Encapsulates the pattern of untidying data into a wide matrix,
  performing some processing, then turning it back into a tidy form. This
  is useful for several operations such as co-occurrence counts,
  correlations, or clustering that are mathematically convenient on wide matrices.
