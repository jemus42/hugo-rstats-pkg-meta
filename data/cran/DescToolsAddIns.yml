title: Interactive Functions to be Used as Shortcuts in 'RStudio'
maintainer: Andri Signorell
description: '''RStudio'' as of recently offers the option to define addins and assign
  shortcuts to them. This package contains addins for a few most frequently used functions
  in a data scientist''s (at least mine) daily work (like str(), example(), plot(),
  head(), view(), Desc()). Most of these functions will use the current selection
  in the editor window and send the specific command to the console while instantly
  executing it. Assigning shortcuts to these addins will save you quite a few keystrokes.'
