title: Decode Coded Variables to Plain Text and the Other Way Around
maintainer: Erik Bulow
description: |-
  Main function "decode" is used to decode coded key values to plain
  text. Function "code" can be used to code plain text to code if there is a
  1:1 relation between the two. The concept relies on 'keyvalue' objects used
  for translation. There are several 'keyvalue' objects included in the areas
  of geographical regional codes, administrative health care unit codes,
  diagnosis codes and more. It is also easy to extend the use by arbitrary
  code sets.
