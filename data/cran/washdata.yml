title: Urban Water and Sanitation Survey Dataset
maintainer: Ernest Guevarra
description: |-
  Urban water and sanitation survey dataset collected by Water and
  Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) with technical support from
  Valid International. These citywide surveys have been collecting data
  allowing water and sanitation service levels across the entire city to be
  characterised, while also allowing more detailed data to be collected in
  areas of the city of particular interest. These surveys are intended to
  generate useful information for others working in the water and sanitation
  sector. Current release version includes datasets collected from a survey
  conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2017. This survey in Dhaka is one of
  a series of surveys to be conducted by WSUP in various
  cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya;
  Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia. This
  package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are completed and
  datasets have been made available.
