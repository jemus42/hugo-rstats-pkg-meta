title: Estimate Energy Fluxes in Food Webs
maintainer: Benoit Gauzens
description: Compute energy fluxes in trophic networks, from resources to their consumers,
  and can be applied to systems ranging from simple two-species interactions to highly
  complex food webs. It implements the approach described in Gauzens et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1101/229450> to calculate energy fluxes, which are also used to calculate
  equilibrium stability.
