  Mixtures of Power Exponential and Skew Power Exponential
  Distributions for Use in Model-Based Clustering and
  Classification
maintainer: Utkarsh J. Dang
description: |-
  Mixtures of skewed and elliptical distributions are implemented using mixtures of multivariate skew
  power exponential and power exponential distributions, respectively. A generalized expectation-maximization
  framework is used for parameter estimation. Methodology for mixtures of power exponential distributions is
  from Dang et al. (2015) <doi: 10.1111/biom.12351>.
