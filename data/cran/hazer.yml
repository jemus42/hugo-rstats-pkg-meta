title: Identifying Foggy and Cloudy Images by Quantifying Haziness
maintainer: Bijan Seyednasrollah
description: Provides a set of functions to estimate haziness of an image based on
  RGB bands. It returns a haze factor, varying from 0 to 1, a metric for fogginess
  and cloudiness. The package also presents additional functions to estimate brightness,
  darkness and contrast rasters of the RGB image. This package can be used for several
  applications such as inference of weather quality data and performing environmental
  studies from interpreting digital images.
