title: A Semi-Parametric Test for Specifying Functional Form
maintainer: Cathrine Ulla Jensen
description: A central decision in a parametric regression is how to specify the relation
  between an dependent variable and each explanatory variable. This package provides
  a semi-parametric tool for comparing different transformations of an  explanatory
  variables in a parametric regression. The functions is relevant in a situation,
  where you would use a box-cox or Box-Tidwell transformations.  In contrast to the
  classic power-transformations, the methods in this package allows for  theoretical
  driven user input and the possibility to compare with a non-parametric transformation.
