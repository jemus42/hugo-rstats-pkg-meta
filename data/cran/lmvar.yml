title: Linear Regression with Non-Constant Variances
maintainer: Marco Nijmeijer
description: 'Runs a linear-like regression with in which both the expected value
  and the variance can vary per observation. The expected values mu follows the standard
  linear model mu = X_mu * beta_mu. The standard deviation sigma follows the model
  log(sigma) = X_sigma * beta_sigma. The package comes with two vignettes: ''Intro''
  gives an introduction, ''Math'' gives mathematical details.'
