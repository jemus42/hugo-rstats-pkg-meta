  Estimating Trend, Velocity and Acceleration from Sea Level
  Records
maintainer: Phil J Watson
description: |-
  Analysis of annual average ocean water level time series, providing
  improved estimates of trend (mean sea level) and associated real-time velocities and
  accelerations. Improved trend estimates are based on singular spectrum analysis
  methods. Various gap-filling options are included to accommodate incomplete time
  series records. The package also includes a range of diagnostic tools to inspect
  the components comprising the original time series which enables expert
  interpretation and selection of likely trend components. A wide range of
  screen and plot to file options are available in the package.
