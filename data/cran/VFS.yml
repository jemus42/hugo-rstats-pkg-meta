title: Vegetated Filter Strip and Erosion Model
maintainer: Sarah Goslee
description: |-
  Empirical models for runoff, erosion, and phosphorus loss
  across a vegetated filter strip, given slope, soils, climate, and
  vegetation (Gall et al., 2018) <doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1505-x>.
  It also includes functions for deriving climate parameters from
  measured daily weather data, and for simulating rainfall. Models
  implemented include MUSLE (Williams, 1975) and APLE (Vadas et al.,
  2009 <doi:10.2134/jeq2008.0337>).
