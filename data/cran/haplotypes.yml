  Manipulating DNA Sequences and Estimating Unambiguous Haplotype
  Network with Statistical Parsimony
maintainer: Caner Aktas
description: Provides S4 classes and methods for reading and manipulating aligned
  DNA sequences, supporting an indel coding methods (only simple indel coding method
  is available in the current version), showing base substitutions and indels, calculating
  absolute pairwise distances between DNA sequences, and collapses identical DNA sequences
  into haplotypes or inferring haplotypes using user provided absolute pairwise character
  difference matrix.  This package also includes S4 classes and methods for estimating
  genealogical relationships among haplotypes using statistical parsimony and plotting
  parsimony networks.
