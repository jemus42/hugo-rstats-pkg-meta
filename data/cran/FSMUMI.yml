title: Imputation of Time Series Based on Fuzzy Logic
maintainer: Thi Thu Hong Phan
description: Filling large gaps in low or uncorrelated multivariate time series uses
  a new fuzzy weighted similarity measure. It contains all required functions to create
  large missing consecutive values within time series and then fill these gaps, according
  to the paper Phan et al. (2018), <DOI:10.1155/2018/9095683>. Performance indicators
  are also provided to compare similarity between two univariate signals (incomplete
  signal and imputed signal).
