  Visualising Bipartite Networks and Calculating Some (Ecological)
  Indices
maintainer: Carsten F. Dormann
description: Functions to visualise webs and calculate a series of indices commonly
  used to describe pattern in (ecological) webs. It focuses on webs consisting of
  only two levels (bipartite), e.g. pollination webs or predator-prey-webs. Visualisation
  is important to get an idea of what we are actually looking at, while the indices
  summarise different aspects of the web's topology.
