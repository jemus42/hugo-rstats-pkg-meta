title: Unconstrained Numerical Optimization Algorithms
maintainer: James Melville
description: |-
  Optimization algorithms implemented in R, including
  conjugate gradient (CG), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the
  limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) methods. Most internal parameters can be set
  through the call interface. The solvers hold up quite well for
  higher-dimensional problems.
