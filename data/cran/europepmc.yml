title: R Interface to the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service
maintainer: Najko Jahn
description: |-
  An R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service
  (see <https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService> for more information). It
  gives access to both metadata on life science literature and open access
  full texts. Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature
  sources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the
  agricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to bibliographic
  metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and reference lists.
  Links between life-science literature and other EBI databases, including
  ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. No registration or API key is
  required. See the vignettes for usage examples.
