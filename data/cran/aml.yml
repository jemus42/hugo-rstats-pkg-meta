title: Adaptive Mixed LASSO
maintainer: Dong Wang
description: This package implements the adaptive mixed lasso (AML) method proposed
  by Wang et al.(2011).  AML applies adaptive lasso penalty to a large number of predictors,  thus
  producing a sparse model, while accounting for the population structure in the linear
  mixed model framework.  The package here is primarily designed for application to
  genome wide association studies or genomic prediction in plant breeding populations,
  though it could be applied to other settings of linear mixed models.
