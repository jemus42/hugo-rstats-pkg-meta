title: Insert Proper Minus Signs
maintainer: Benjamin E. Wolfe
description: |-
  Provides convenience functions to replace hyphen-minuses (ASCII 45)
  with proper minus signs (Unicode character 2212). The true minus matches
  the plus symbol in width, line thickness, and height above the baseline.
  It was designed for mathematics, looks better in presentation,
  and is understood properly by screen readers.
