title: Robust Geostatistical Analysis of Spatial Data
maintainer: Andreas Papritz
description: |-
  Provides functions for efficiently fitting linear models with
  spatially correlated errors by robust and Gaussian (Restricted)
  Maximum Likelihood and for computing robust and customary point
  and block external-drift Kriging predictions, along with utility
  functions for variogram modelling in ad hoc geostatistical analyses,
  model building, model evaluation by cross-validation, (conditional)
  simulation of Gaussian processes, unbiased back-transformation of
  Kriging predictions of log-transformed data.
