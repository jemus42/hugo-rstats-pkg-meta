version: 1.10.0
title: Manipulate and Visualize VCF Data
maintainer: Brian J. Knaus
description: |-
  Facilitates easy manipulation of variant call format (VCF) data.
  Functions are provided to rapidly read from and write to VCF files. Once
  VCF data is read into R a parser function extracts matrices of data. This
  information can then be used for quality control or other purposes. Additional
  functions provide visualization of genomic data. Once processing is complete
  data may be written to a VCF file (*.vcf.gz). It also may be converted into
  other popular R objects (e.g., genlight, DNAbin). VcfR provides a link between
  VCF data and familiar R software.
