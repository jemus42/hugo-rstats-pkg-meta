title: Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes
maintainer: Peter Carbonetto
description: |-
  The R package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes
  approach for large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery
  rate (FDR) estimation based on the methods proposed in
  M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new deal",
  <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>. These methods can be applied
  whenever two sets of summary statistics---estimated effects and
  standard errors---are available, just as 'qvalue' can be applied
  to previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces are
  provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and ash.workhorse(),
  which has more options and is geared toward advanced users. The
  ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a flexible modeling
  interface that can accommodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g.,
  normal, Poisson) and mixture priors (e.g., uniform, normal).
