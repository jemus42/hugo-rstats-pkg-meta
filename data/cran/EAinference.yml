title: Estimator Augmentation and Simulation-Based Inference
maintainer: Seunghyun Min
description: |-
  Estimator augmentation methods for statistical inference on high-dimensional data,
  as described in Zhou, Q. (2014) <arXiv:1401.4425v2>
  and Zhou, Q. and Min, S. (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-EJS1309>.
  It provides several simulation-based inference methods: (a) Gaussian and
  wild multiplier bootstrap for lasso, group lasso, scaled lasso, scaled group
  lasso and their de-biased estimators, (b) importance sampler for approximating
  p-values in these methods, (c) Markov chain Monte Carlo lasso sampler with
  applications in post-selection inference.
