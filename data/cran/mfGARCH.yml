title: Mixed-Frequency GARCH Models
maintainer: Onno Kleen
description: 'Estimating GARCH-MIDAS (MIxed-DAta-Sampling) models (Engle, Ghysels,
  Sohn, 2013, <doi:10.1162/REST_a_00300>) and related statistical inference, accompanying
  the paper "Two are better than one: Volatility forecasting using multiplicative
  component GARCH models" by Conrad and Kleen (2020, <doi:10.1002/jae.2742>). The
  GARCH-MIDAS model decomposes the conditional variance of (daily) stock returns into
  a short- and long-term component, where the latter may depend on an exogenous covariate
  sampled at a lower frequency.'
