title: Implementation of the Horseshoe Prior
maintainer: Stephanie van der Pas
description: |-
  Contains functions for applying the horseshoe prior to high-
  dimensional linear regression, yielding the posterior mean and credible
  intervals, amongst other things. The key parameter tau can be equipped with
  a prior or estimated via maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE).
  The main function, horseshoe, is for linear regression. In addition, there
  are functions specifically for the sparse normal means problem, allowing
  for faster computation of for example the posterior mean and posterior
  variance. Finally, there is a function available to perform variable
  selection, using either a form of thresholding, or credible intervals.
