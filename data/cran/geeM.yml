description: |-
  GEE estimation of the parameters in mean structures with possible
  correlation between the outcomes. User-specified mean link and variance
  functions are allowed, along with observation weighting. The 'M' in the name
  'geeM' is meant to emphasize the use of the Matrix package, which allows for an
  implementation based fully in R.
