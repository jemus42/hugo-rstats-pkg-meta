title: QUick IDentification of DIagnostic CHaracters
maintainer: A. Luise Kuehn
description: 'Provides tools for an automated identification of diagnostic molecular
  characters, i.e. such columns in a given nucleotide or amino acid alignment that
  allow to distinguish taxa from each other. These characters can then be used to
  complement the formal descriptions of the taxa, which are often based on morphological
  and anatomical features. Especially for morphologically cryptic species, this will
  be helpful. QUIDDICH distinguishes between four different types of diagnostic characters.
  For more information, see "Kuehn, A.L., Haase, M. 2019. QUIDDICH: QUick IDentification
  of DIagnostic CHaracters."'
