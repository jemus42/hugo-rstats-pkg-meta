title: Transmission Ratio Distortion
maintainer: Lam Opal Huang
description: Transmission Ratio Distortion (TRD) is a genetic phenomenon where the
  two alleles from either parent are not transmitted to the offspring at the expected
  1:1 ratio under Mendelian inheritance, leading to spurious signals in genetic association
  studies. Functions in this package are developed to account for this phenomenon
  using loglinear model and Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT). Some population
  information can also be calculated.
