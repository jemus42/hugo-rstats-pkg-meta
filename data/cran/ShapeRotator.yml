  Standardised Rigid Rotations of Articulated Three-Dimensional
  Structures
maintainer: Marta Vidal-Garcia
description: Here we describe a simple geometric rigid rotation approach that removes
  the effect of random translation and rotation, enabling the morphological analysis
  of 3D articulated structures. Our method is based on Cartesian coordinates in 3D
  space so it can be applied to any morphometric problem that also uses 3D coordinates.
