title: Longitudinal Concordance Correlation
maintainer: Thiago de Paula Oliveira
description: Estimates the longitudinal concordance correlation to access the longitudinal
  agreement profile. The estimation approach implemented is variance components approach
  based on polynomial mixed effects regression model, as proposed by Oliveira, Hinde
  and Zocchi (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13253-018-0321-1>.  In addition, non-parametric
  confidence intervals were implemented using percentile method or normal-approximation
  based on Fisher Z-transformation.
