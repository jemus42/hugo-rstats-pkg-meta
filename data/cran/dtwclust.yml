  Time Series Clustering Along with Optimizations for the Dynamic
  Time Warping Distance
maintainer: Alexis Sarda
description: |-
  Time series clustering along with optimized techniques related
  to the Dynamic Time Warping distance and its corresponding lower bounds.
  Implementations of partitional, hierarchical, fuzzy, k-Shape and TADPole
  clustering are available. Functionality can be easily extended with
  custom distance measures and centroid definitions. Implementations of
  DTW barycenter averaging, a distance based on global alignment kernels,
  and the soft-DTW distance and centroid routines are also provided.
  All included distance functions have custom loops optimized for the
  calculation of cross-distance matrices, including parallelization support.
  Several cluster validity indices are included.
