title: R Package for Ridge Fusion in Statistical Learning
maintainer: Bradley S. Price
description: This package implements ridge fusion methodology for inverse covariance
  matrix estimation for use in quadratic discriminant analysis.  The package also
  contains function for model based clustering using ridge fusion for inverse matrix
  estimation, as well as tuning parameter selection functions.  We have also implemented
  QDA using joint inverse covariance estimation.
