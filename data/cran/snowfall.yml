version: 1.84-6.1
title: Easier cluster computing (based on snow).
maintainer: Jochen Knaus
description: |-
  Usability wrapper around snow for easier development of
  parallel R programs. This package offers e.g. extended error
  checks, and additional functions. All functions work in
  sequential mode, too, if no cluster is present or wished.
  Package is also designed as connector to the cluster management
  tool sfCluster, but can also used without it.
