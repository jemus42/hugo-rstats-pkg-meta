description: |-
  Fits the Multiple Random Dot Product Graph Model and performs a test
  for whether two networks come from the same distribution. Both methods are
  proposed in Nielsen, A.M., Witten, D., (2018) "The Multiple Random Dot Product Graph
  Model", arXiv preprint <arXiv:1811.12172> (Submitted to Journal of Computational
  and Graphical Statistics).
