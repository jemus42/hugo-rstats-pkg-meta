description: |-
  Functions to test/check/verify/investigate the ordering of vectors.
  The 'is_[strictly_]*' family of functions test vectors for
  'sorted', 'monotonic', 'increasing', 'decreasing' order; 'is_constant'
  and 'is_incremental' test for the degree of ordering. `ordering`
  provides a numeric indication of ordering -2 (strictly decreasing) to
  2 (strictly increasing).
