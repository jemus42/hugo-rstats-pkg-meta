title: Distance Sampling Survey Design
maintainer: Laura Marshall
description: |-
  Creates survey designs for distance sampling surveys. These
  designs can be assessed for various effort and coverage statistics.
  Once the user is satisfied with the design characteristics they can
  generate a set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey.
  Many of the designs implemented in this R package were first made
  available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are detailed in
  Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al. (2008,
  ISBN-13: 978-0199225873). Find out more about estimating animal/plant
  abundance with distance sampling at <http://distancesampling.org/>.
