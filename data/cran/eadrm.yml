title: Fitting Dose-Response Models Using an Evolutionary Algorithm
maintainer: Eric Bair
description: |-
  Fits dose-response models using an evolutionary
  algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The procedure currently
  can fit 3-parameter, 4-parameter, and 5-parameter log-logistic models
  as well as exponential models. Functions are also provided to plot,
  make predictions, and calculate confidence intervals for the resulting
  models. For details see "Nonlinear Dose-response Modeling of
  High-Throughput Screening Data Using an Evolutionary Algorithm",
