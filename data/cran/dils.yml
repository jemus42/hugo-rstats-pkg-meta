description: Combine multiple-relationship networks into a single weighted<U+000a>network.  The
  approach is similar to factor analysis in the that<U+000a>contribution from each
  constituent network varies so as to maximize the<U+000a>information gleaned from
  the multiple-relationship networks.<U+000a>This implementation uses Principal Component
  Analysis calculated using<U+000a>'prcomp' with bootstrap subsampling.  Missing links
  are imputed using<U+000a>the method of Chen et al.<U+000a>(2012).
