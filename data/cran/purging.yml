  Simple Method for Purging Mediation Effects among Independent
  Variables
maintainer: Philip D. Waggoner
description: Simple method of purging independent variables of mediating effects.
  First, regress the direct variable on the indirect variable. Then, used the stored
  residuals as the new purged (direct) variable in the updated specification. This
  purging process allows for use of a new direct variable uncorrelated with the indirect
  variable. Please cite the method and/or package using Waggoner, Philip D. (2018)
