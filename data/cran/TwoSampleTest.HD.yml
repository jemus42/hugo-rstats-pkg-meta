  A Two-Sample Test for the Equality of Distributions for
  High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Marta Cousido Rocha
description: For high-dimensional data whose main feature is a large number, p, of
  variables but a small sample size, the null hypothesis that the marginal distributions
  of p variables are the same for two groups is tested. We propose a test statistic
  motivated by the simple idea of comparing, for each of the p variables, the empirical
  characteristic functions computed from the two samples. If one rejects this global
  null hypothesis of no differences in distributions between the two groups, a set
  of permutation p-values is reported to identify which variables are not equally
  distributed in both groups.
