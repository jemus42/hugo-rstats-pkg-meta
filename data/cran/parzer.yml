title: Parse Messy Geographic Coordinates
maintainer: Scott Chamberlain
description: |-
  Parse geographic coordinates from various formats
  to decimal degree numeric values. Parse coordinates into
  their parts (degree, minutes, seconds); calculate hemisphere
  from coordinates; pull out individually degrees,
  minutes, or seconds; add and subtract degrees, minutes,
  and seconds. C++ code herein originally inspired from code
  written by Jeffrey D. Bogan (<http://bit.ly/CLongLatString>),
  but then completely re-written.
