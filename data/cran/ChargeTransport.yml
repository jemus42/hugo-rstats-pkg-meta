title: Charge Transfer Rates and Charge Carrier Mobilities
maintainer: Julien Id√©
description: This package provides functions to compute Marcus, Marcus-Levich-Jortner
  or Landau-Zener charge transfer rates. These rates can then be used to perform kinetic
  Monte Carlo simulations to estimate charge carrier mobilities in molecular materials.
  The preparation of this package was supported by the the Fondazione Cariplo (PLENOS
  project, ref. 2011-0349).
