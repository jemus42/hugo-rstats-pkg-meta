title: Programming with Big Data -- Interface to 'ZeroMQ'
maintainer: Wei-Chen Chen
description: |-
  'ZeroMQ' is a well-known library for high-performance
  asynchronous messaging in scalable, distributed applications.  This
  package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize
  'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming
  frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.2.2)
  is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation
  of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with
  'rzmq' are also provided.
