title: Collapsed Gibbs Sampling Methods for Topic Models
maintainer: Jonathan Chang
description: |-
  Implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
  and related models.  This includes (but is not limited
  to) sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-membership stochastic
  blockmodel.  Inference for all of these models is
  implemented via a fast collapsed Gibbs sampler written
  in C.  Utility functions for reading/writing data
  typically used in topic models, as well as tools for
  examining posterior distributions are also included.
