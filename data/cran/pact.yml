title: Predictive Analysis of Clinical Trials
maintainer: Jyothi Subramanian
description: |-
  A prediction-based approach to the analysis of data from
  randomized clinical trials is implemented. Based on response and
  covariate data from a randomized clinical trial comparing a new
  experimental treatment E versus a control C, the objective is to
  develop and internally validate a model that can identify subjects
  likely to benefit from E rather than C. Currently,
  survival and binary response types are permitted.
