title: 'GAD: Analysis of variance from general principles'
maintainer: Leonardo Sandrini-Neto
description: |-
  This package analyses complex ANOVA models with any
  combination of orthogonal/nested and fixed/random factors, as
  described by Underwood (1997). There are two restrictions: (i)
  data must be balanced; (ii) fixed nested factors are not
  allowed. Homogeneity of variances is checked using Cochran's C
  test and 'a posteriori' comparisons of means are done using
  Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure.
