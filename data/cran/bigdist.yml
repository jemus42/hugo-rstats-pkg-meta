title: Store Distance Matrices on Disk
maintainer: Komala Sheshachala Srikanth
description: Provides utilities to compute, store and access distance matrices on
  disk as file-backed matrices provided by the 'bigstatsr' package. File-backed distance
  matrices are stored as a symmetric matrix to facilitate out-of-memory operations
  on file-backed matrix while the in-memory 'dist' object stores only the lower diagonal
  elements. 'disto' provides an unified interface to work with in-memory and disk-based
  distance matrices.
