title: Bayesian Inference for Discrete Weibull Regression
maintainer: Hamed Haselimashhadi
description: A Bayesian regression model for discrete response, where the conditional
  distribution is modelled via a discrete Weibull distribution. This package provides
  an implementation of Metropolis-Hastings and Reversible-Jumps algorithms to draw
  samples from the posterior. It covers a wide range of regularizations through any
  two parameter prior. Examples are Laplace (Lasso), Gaussian (ridge), Uniform, Cauchy
  and customized priors like a mixture of priors. An extensive visual toolbox is included
  to check the validity of the results as well as several measures of goodness-of-fit.
