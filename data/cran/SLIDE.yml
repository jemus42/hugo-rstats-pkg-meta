title: Single Cell Linkage by Distance Estimation is SLIDE
maintainer: Arjun Panda
description: |-
  This statistical method uses the nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate absolute distances between single cells
  based on a chosen constellation of surface proteins, with these distances being a measure of the similarity between the
  two cells being compared. Based on Sen, N., Mukherjee, G., and Arvin, A.M. (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.07.008>.
