  Exact Test from the Combinations of Mutually Exclusive
  Alterations (CoMEt) Algorithm
maintainer: Max Leiserson
description: An algorithm for identifying combinations of mutually exclusive alterations
  in cancer genomes. CoMEt represents the mutations in a set M of k genes with a 2^k
  dimensional contingency table, and then computes the tail probability of observing
  T(M) exclusive alterations using an exact statistical test.
