description: To detect outliers using different methods namely model based outlier
  detection (Barnett, V. 1978 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2347159>), distance based
  outlier detection (Hautamaki, V., Karkkainen, I., and Franti, P. 2004 <http://cs.uef.fi/~franti/papers.html>),
  dispersion based outlier detection (Jin, W., Tung, A., and Han, J. 2001 <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-25465-X_7>),
  depth based outlier detection (Johnson, T., Kwok, I., and Ng, R.T. 1998 <http://www.aaai.org/Library/KDD/1998/kdd98-038.php>)
  and density based outlier detection (Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P., Sander, J., and
  Xu, X. 1996 <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001507>). This package provides
  labelling of observations as outliers and outlierliness of each outlier. For univariate,
