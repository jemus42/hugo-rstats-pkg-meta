maintainer: Maxime Turgeon
description: |-
  Principal component of explained variance (PCEV) is a statistical
  tool for the analysis of a multivariate response vector. It is a dimension-
  reduction technique, similar to Principal component analysis (PCA), that seeks
  to maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained
  by a set of covariates.
