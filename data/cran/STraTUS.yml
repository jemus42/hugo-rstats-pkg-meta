  Enumeration and Uniform Sampling of Transmission Trees for a
  Known Phylogeny
maintainer: Matthew Hall
description: For a single, known pathogen phylogeny, provides functions for enumeration
  of the set of compatible epidemic transmission trees, and for uniform sampling from
  that set. Optional arguments allow for incomplete sampling with a known number of
  missing individuals, multiple sampling, and known infection time limits. Always
  assumed are a complete transmission bottleneck and no superinfection or reinfection.
  See Hall and Colijn (2019) <doi:10.1093/molbev/msz058> for methodology.
