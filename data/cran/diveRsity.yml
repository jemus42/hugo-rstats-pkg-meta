title: |-
  A Comprehensive, General Purpose Population Genetics Analysis
  Package
maintainer: Kevin Keenan
description: |-
  Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity partition
  statistics, genetic differentiation statistics, and locus informativeness
  for ancestry assignment.
  It also provides users with various option to calculate
  bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals both across loci,
  for pairwise population comparisons, and to plot these results interactively.
  Parallel computing capabilities and pairwise results without
  bootstrapping are provided.
  Also calculates F-statistics from Weir and Cockerham (1984).
  Various plotting features are provided, as well as Chi-square tests of
  genetic heterogeneity.
  Functionality for the calculation of various diversity parameters is
  possible for RAD-seq derived SNP data sets containing thousands of marker loci.
  A shiny application for the development of microsatellite multiplexes is
  also available.
