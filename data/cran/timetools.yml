  Seasonal/Sequential (Instants/Durations, Even or not) Time
  Series
maintainer: Vladislav Navel
description: 'Objects to manipulate sequential and seasonal time series. Sequential
  time series based on time instants and time durations are handled. Both can be regularly
  or unevenly spaced (overlapping durations are allowed). Only POSIX* format are used
  for dates and times. The following classes are provided : ''POSIXcti'', ''POSIXctp'',
  ''TimeIntervalDataFrame'', ''TimeInstantDataFrame'', ''SubtimeDataFrame'' ; methods
  to switch from a class to another and to modify the time support of series (hourly
  time series to daily time series for instance) are also defined. Tools provided
  can be used for instance to handle environmental monitoring data (not always produced
  on a regular time base).'
