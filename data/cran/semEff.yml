  Automatic Calculation of Effects for Piecewise Structural
  Equation Models
maintainer: Mark Murphy
description: |-
  Provides functionality to automatically calculate direct, indirect,
  and total effects from piecewise structural equation models, comprising
  lists of fitted models representing structured equations (Lefcheck 2016
  <doi:10/f8s8rb>). Confidence intervals are provided via bootstrapping.
