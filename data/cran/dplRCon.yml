title: Concordance for Dendroclimatology
maintainer: M R Pirie
description: 'The concordance method is a non-parametric method based on bootstrapping
  that is used to test the hypothesis that two subsets of time series are similar
  in terms of mean, variance or both. This method was developed to address a concern
  within dendroclimatology that young trees may produce a differing climate response
  to older more established trees. Details of this method are available in  Pirie,
  M. (2013). The Climate of New Zealand reconstructed from kauri tree rings: Enhancement
  through the use of novel statistical methodology. PhD. Dissertation, School of Environment
  and Department of Statistics, University of Auckland, New Zealand. This package
  also produces a figure with 3 panels, each panel is for a different climate variable.
  An example of this figure in included in "On the influence of tree size on the climate
  - growth relationship of New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis): insights from annual,
  monthly and daily growth patterns. J Wunder, AM Fowler, ER Cook, M Pirie, SPJ McCloskey.
  Trees 27 (4), 937-948". For further R functions for loading your own dendroclimatology
  datasets and performing dendrochronology analysis refer to the R package "dplR:
  Dendrochronology Program Library in R". The concordance procedure is intended to
  add to the standard dendrochronology techniques provided in "dplR".'
