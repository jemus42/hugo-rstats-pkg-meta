title: GUI Tools to Process, Analyze and Plot Fisheries Data
maintainer: Lorenzo D'Andrea
description: |-
  The tools you need to process, analyze, combine, integrate and
  plot your fishery data: the georeferenced dataset from the Vessel Monitoring
  System (VMS), from the Automatic Information System (AIS) or other tracking
  devices, as well as the catches or landings dataset from the Logbook or Vessel
  Register. Package 'vmsbase' is equipped by Viewer Tools to visually inspect data
  at different steps of the analyses and to produce effective outputs for reports
  and scientific publications. Viewers are conceived to show the VMS pings, to
  visualize single or multiple tracks for fishing vessels, or to represent the VMS
  data on Google Viewer, so that the user can produce easy to interpret and more
  realistic visualization of both fishing effort and effort behaviour. Package
  'vmsbase' represents the implementation of several R routines which have been
  developed by the "Tor Vergata" University of Rome Team involved in the Italian
  National Program for the Data Collection Framework for Fisheries Data between
  2009-2012.
