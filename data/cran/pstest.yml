title: Specification Tests for Parametric Propensity Score Models
maintainer: Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna
description: |-
  The propensity score is one of the most widely used tools in
  studying the causal effect of a treatment, intervention, or policy. Given that
  the propensity score is usually unknown, it has to be estimated, implying that
  the reliability of many treatment effect estimators depends on the correct
  specification of the (parametric) propensity score. This package implements the
  data-driven nonparametric diagnostic tools for detecting propensity score
  misspecification proposed by Sant'Anna and Song (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.02.002>.
