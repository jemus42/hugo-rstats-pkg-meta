title: Efficient Score Statistics for Genome-Wide SNP Set Analysis
maintainer: Alexander Sibley
description: |-
  An implementation of the use of efficient score statistics
  in genome-wide SNP set analysis with complex traits. Three standard score statistics
  (Cox, binomial, and Gaussian) are provided, but the package is easily extensible to
  include others. Code implementing the inferential procedure is primarily written in C++ and
  utilizes parallelization of the analysis to reduce runtime. A supporting function offers
  simple computation of observed, permutation, and FWER and FDR adjusted p-values.
