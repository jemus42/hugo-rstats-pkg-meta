title: Geographically-Weighted Models
maintainer: Binbin Lu
description: 'Techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics,termed geographically-weighted
  (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some
  global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration
  provides a better description. ''GWmodel'' includes functions to calibrate: GW summary
  statistics (Brunsdon et al. 2002)<doi: 10.1016/s0198-9715(01)00009-6>, GW principal
  components analysis (Harris et al. 2011)<doi: 10.1080/13658816.2011.554838>, GW
  discriminant analysis (Brunsdon et al. 2007)<doi: 10.1111/j.1538-4632.2007.00709.x>
  and various forms of GW regression (Brunsdon et al. 1996)<doi: 10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x>;
  some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.'
