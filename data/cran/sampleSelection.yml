title: Sample Selection Models
maintainer: Arne Henningsen
description: |-
  Two-step
  and maximum likelihood estimation
  of Heckman-type sample selection models:
  standard sample selection models (Tobit-2),
  endogenous switching regression models (Tobit-5),
  sample selection models with binary dependent outcome variable,
  interval regression with sample selection (only ML estimation),
  and endogenous treatment effects models.
  These methods are described in the three vignettes
  that are included in this package
  and in econometric textbooks such as
  Greene (2011, Econometric Analysis, 7th edition, Pearson).
