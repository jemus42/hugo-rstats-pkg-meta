title: An R Package for Simulating IRT-Based Computerized Adaptive<U+000a>Tests
maintainer: Steven W. Nydick
description: Functions designed to simulate data that conform to basic<U+000a>unidimensional
  IRT models (for now 3-parameter binary response models<U+000a>and graded response
  models) along with Post-Hoc CAT simulations of<U+000a>those models with various
  item selection methods, ability estimation<U+000a>methods, and termination criteria.
