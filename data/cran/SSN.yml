title: Spatial Modeling on Stream Networks
maintainer: Jay Ver Hoef
description: Spatial statistical modeling and prediction for data on stream networks,
  including models based on in-stream distance (Ver Hoef, J.M. and Peterson, E.E.,
  2010. <DOI:10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08248>.) Models are created using moving average
  constructions. Spatial linear models, including explanatory variables, can be fit
  with (restricted) maximum likelihood.  Mapping and other graphical functions are
  included.
