title: Fast Imputations Using 'Rcpp' and 'Armadillo'
maintainer: Maciej Nasinski
description: |2-

  Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm.
  There was used quantitative models with a closed-form solution. Thus package is based on linear algebra operations.
  The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve for a calculation where a grouping variable have to be used.
  A single evaluation of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement.
  Moreover there are offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages such as 'data.table' or 'dplyr'.
