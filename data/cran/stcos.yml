title: Space-Time Change of Support
maintainer: Andrew M. Raim
description: |-
  Spatio-temporal change of support (STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference
  on geographic and time domains which differ from those on which the data were observed. In
  particular, a parsimonious class of STCOS models supporting Gaussian outcomes was introduced
  by Bradley, Wikle, and Holan <doi:10.1002/sta4.94>. The 'stcos' package contains tools which
  facilitate use of STCOS models.
