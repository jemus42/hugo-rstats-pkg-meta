title: Vanilla HTML Components for 'Dash'
maintainer: Ryan Patrick Kyle
description: '''Dash'' is a web application framework that provides pure Python and
  R abstraction around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of writing HTML or using
  an HTML templating engine, you compose your layout using R functions within the
  ''dashHtmlComponents'' package. The source for this package is on GitHub: plotly/dash-html-components.'
