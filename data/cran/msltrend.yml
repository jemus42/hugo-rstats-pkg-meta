  Improved Techniques to Estimate Trend, Velocity and Acceleration
  from Sea Level Records
maintainer: Phil J Watson
description: |-
  Analysis of annual average ocean water level time series
  from long (minimum length 80 years) individual records, providing improved
  estimates of trend (mean sea level) and associated real-time velocities and
  accelerations. Improved trend estimates are based on Singular Spectrum Analysis
  methods. Various gap-filling options are included to accommodate incomplete time
  series records. The package also contains a forecasting module to consider the
  implication of user defined quantum of sea level rise between the end of the
  available historical record and the year 2100. A wide range of screen and pdf
  plotting options are available in the package.
