title: Access the 'Google Adwords' API
maintainer: Sean Longthorpe
description: |-
  Allows access to selected services that are part of the
  'Google Adwords' API <https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/start>.
  'Google Adwords' is an online advertising service by 'Google', that delivers Ads
  to users. This package offers a authentication process using 'OAUTH2'.  Currently,
  there are two methods of data of accessing the API, depending on the type of
  request. One method uses 'SOAP' requests which require building an 'XML' structure
  and then sent to the API. These are used for the 'ManagedCustomerService' and
  the 'TargetingIdeaService'. The second method is by building 'AWQL' queries for
  the reporting side of the 'Google Adwords' API.
