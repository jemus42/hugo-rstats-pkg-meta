description: |-
  Provides functions to aid the identification of probable/possible
  duplicates in Plant Genetic Resources (PGR) collections using
  'passport databases' comprising of information records of each constituent
  sample. These include methods for cleaning the data, creation of a
  searchable Key Word in Context (KWIC) index of keywords associated with
  sample records and the identification of nearly identical records with
  similar information by fuzzy, phonetic and semantic matching of keywords.
