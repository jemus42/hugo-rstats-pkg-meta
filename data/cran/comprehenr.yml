title: List Comprehensions
maintainer: Gregory Demin
description: |-
  Provides 'Python'-style list comprehensions.
  List comprehension expressions use usual loops (for(), while() and repeat()) and
  usual if() as list producers. In many cases it gives more concise notation than
  standard "*apply + filter" strategy.
