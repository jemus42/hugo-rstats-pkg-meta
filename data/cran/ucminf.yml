title: General-Purpose Unconstrained Non-Linear Optimization
maintainer: Stig Bousgaard Mortensen
description: |-
  An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization.
  The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse
  Hessian and soft line search with a trust region type monitoring of the
  input to the line search algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is
  designed for easy interchange with 'optim'.
