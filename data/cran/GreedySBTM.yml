title: Greedy Stochastic Block Transition Models
maintainer: Riccardo Rastelli
description: Performs clustering on the nodes of an undirected binary dynamic network,
  by maximising the exact integrated complete likelihood. The greedy algorithm used
  is described in Rastelli, R. (2017) "Exact integrated completed likelihood maximisation
  in a stochastic block transition model for dynamic networks" <arXiv:1710.03551>.
