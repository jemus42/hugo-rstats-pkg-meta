title: R Wrappers for EXPOKIT; Other Matrix Functions
maintainer: Nicholas J. Matzke
description: |-
  Wraps some of the matrix exponentiation
  utilities from EXPOKIT (<http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/>),
  a FORTRAN library that is widely recommended for matrix
  exponentiation (Sidje RB, 1998. "Expokit: A Software Package
  for Computing Matrix Exponentials." ACM Trans. Math. Softw.
  24(1): 130-156).  EXPOKIT includes functions for
  exponentiating both small, dense matrices, and large, sparse
  matrices (in sparse matrices, most of the cells have value 0).
  Rapid matrix exponentiation is useful in phylogenetics when we
  have a large number of states (as we do when we are inferring
  the history of transitions between the possible geographic
  ranges of a species), but is probably useful in other ways as
  well.
