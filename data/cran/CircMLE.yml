title: Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Circular Data
maintainer: Robert Fitak
description: |-
  A series of wrapper functions to
  implement the 10 maximum likelihood models of animal orientation
  described by Schnute and Groot (1992) <DOI:10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80068-5>. The
  functions also include the ability to use different optimizer
  methods and calculate various model selection metrics (i.e., AIC,
  AICc, BIC).  The ability to perform variants of the Hermans-Rasson test and
  Pycke test is also included as described in Landler et al. (2019)
  <DOI:10.1186/s12898-019-0246-8>.
