title: Rapid Calculation of Phylogenetic Information Content
maintainer: Alex Dornburg
description: Enables rapid calculation of phylogenetic information content using the
  latest advances in phylogenetic informativeness based theory. These advances include
  modifications that incorporate uneven branch lengths and any model of nucleotide
  substitution to provide assessments of the phylogenetic utility of any given dataset
  or dataset partition. Also provides new tools for data visualization and routines
  optimized for rapid statistical calculations, including approaches making use of
  Bayesian posterior distributions and parallel processing. Users can apply these
  approaches toward screening datasets for phylogenetic/genomic information content.
