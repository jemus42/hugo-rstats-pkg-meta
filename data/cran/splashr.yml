  Tools to Work with the 'Splash' 'JavaScript' Rendering and
  Scraping Service
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  'Splash' <https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash> is a 'JavaScript' rendering service.
  It is a lightweight web browser with an 'HTTP' API, implemented in 'Python' using 'Twisted'
  and 'QT' and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium' or 'seleniumPipes'
  R packages in a lightweight footprint. Some of 'Splash' features include the ability to process
  multiple web pages in parallel; retrieving 'HTML' results and/or take screen shots; disabling
  images or use 'Adblock Plus' rules to make rendering faster; executing custom 'JavaScript' in
  page context; getting detailed rendering info in 'HAR' format.
