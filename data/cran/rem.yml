maintainer: Laurence Brandenberger
description: 'Calculate endogenous network effects in event sequences and fit relational
  event models (REM): Using network event sequences (where each tie between a sender
  and a target in a network is time-stamped), REMs can measure how networks form and
  evolve over time. Endogenous patterns such as popularity effects, inertia, similarities,
  cycles or triads can be calculated and analyzed over time.'
