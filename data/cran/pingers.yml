title: Identify, Ping, and Log Internet Provider Connection Data
maintainer: Jesse Vent
description: |-
  To assist you with troubleshooting internet connection issues and
  assist in isolating packet loss on your network. It does this by allowing you to
  retrieve the top trace route destinations your internet provider uses, and recursively
  ping each server in series while capturing the results and writing them to a log file.
  Each iteration it queries the destinations again, before shuffling the sequence of
  destinations to ensure the analysis is unbiased and consistent across each trace route.
