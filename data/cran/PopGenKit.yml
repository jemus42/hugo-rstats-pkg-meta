  Useful functions for (batch) file conversion and data resampling
  in microsatellite datasets
maintainer: Sebastien Rioux Paquette
description: |-
  There are two main purposes to this package. The first is
  to allow batch conversion of Genepop (Rousset 2008) input files
  for use with Arlequin (Excoffier and Lischer 2010), which has a
  simple GUI to analyze batch files. Two commonly used simulation
  software, BottleSim (Kuo & Janzen 2003) and Easypop (Balloux
  2001) produce Genepop output files that can be analyzed this
  way. There are also functions to convert to and from BottleSim
  format, to quickly produce allele frequency tables or to
  convert a file directly for use in ordination analyses (e.g.
  principal component analysis). This package also includes
  functions to calculate allele rarefaction curves, confidence
  intervals on heterozygosity and allelic richness with
  resampling strategies (bootstrap and jackknife).
