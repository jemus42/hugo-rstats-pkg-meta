title: Data Exchange Between R and 'LabKey' Server
maintainer: Cory Nathe
description: |-
  The 'LabKey' client library for R makes it easy for R users to
  load live data from a 'LabKey' Server, <http://www.labkey.com/>,
  into the R environment for analysis, provided users have permissions
  to read the data. It also enables R users to insert, update, and
  delete records stored on a 'LabKey' Server, provided they have appropriate
  permissions to do so.
