title: Implementation of Marker-Assisted Mini-Pooling with Algorithm
maintainer: '"Tao Liu, PhD"'
description: |-
  To determine the number of quantitative assays needed for a sample
  of data using pooled testing methods, which include mini-pooling (MP), MP
  with algorithm (MPA), and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA). To estimate the number
  of assays needed, the package also provides a tool to conduct Monte Carlo (MC)
  to simulate different orders in which the sample would be collected to form pools.
  Using MC avoids the dependence of the estimated number of assays on any specific
  ordering of the samples to form pools.
