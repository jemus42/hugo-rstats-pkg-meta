  Performs cluster analysis using an ensemble
  clustering framework, Chiu & Talhouk (2018)
  <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1996-y>.  Results from a diverse set of
  algorithms are pooled together using methods such as majority voting,
  K-Modes, LinkCluE, and CSPA. There are options to compare cluster
  assignments across algorithms using internal and external indices,
  visualizations such as heatmaps, and significance testing for the
  existence of clusters.
