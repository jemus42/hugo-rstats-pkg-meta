title: Interface to 'TensorFlow' Hub
maintainer: Daniel Falbel
description: |-
  'TensorFlow' Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and
  consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a
  self-contained piece of a 'TensorFlow' graph, along with its weights and
  assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as
  transfer learning. Transfer learning train a model with a smaller dataset,
  improve generalization, and speed up training.
