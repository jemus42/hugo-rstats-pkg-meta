  Build Regression Models Quickly and Display the Results Using
  'ggplot2'
maintainer: Xikun Han
description: |-
  A set of functions to extract results from regression models and
  plot the effect size using 'ggplot2' seamlessly. While 'broom' is useful to
  convert statistical analysis objects into tidy data frames, 'coefplot' is adept at showing
  multivariate regression results. With specific outcome, this package could build regression models
  automatically, extract results into a data frame and provide a quicker way to summarize
  models' statistical findings using 'ggplot2'.
