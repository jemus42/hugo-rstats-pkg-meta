  Fitting Univariate Censored Linear Regression Model with
  Autoregressive Errors
maintainer: Fernanda L. Schumacher
description: |-
  It fits an univariate left or right censored linear regression model
  with autoregressive errors under the normal distribution. It provides estimates
  and standard errors of the parameters, prediction of future observations and
  it supports missing values on the dependent variable.
  It also performs influence diagnostic through local influence for three possible
  perturbation schemes.
