title: Build Function Factories
maintainer: Jon Harmon
description: |-
  Function factories are functions that make functions. They can be
  confusing to construct. Straightforward techniques can produce functions
  that are fragile or hard to understand. While more robust techniques exist
  to construct function factories, those techniques can be confusing. This
  package is designed to make it easier to construct function factories.
