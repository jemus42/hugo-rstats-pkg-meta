version: '0.80'
title: ANES Raking Implementation
maintainer: Josh Pasek
description: |-
  Provides a comprehensive system for selecting
  variables and weighting data to match the specifications of the American
  National Election Studies. The package includes methods for identifying
  discrepant variables, raking data, and assessing the effects of the raking
  algorithm. It also allows automated re-raking if target variables fall
  outside identified bounds and allows greater user specification than other
  available raking algorithms. A variety of simple weighted statistics that
  were previously in this package (version .55 and earlier) have been moved to
  the package 'weights.'
