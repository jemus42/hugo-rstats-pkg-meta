  Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for Bayesian
  Models
maintainer: Jonah Gabry
description: |-
  Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO)
  for Bayesian models fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo, as
  described in Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4>.
  The approximation uses Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS),
  a new procedure for regularizing importance weights.
  As a byproduct of the calculations, we also obtain approximate
  standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for the comparison
  of predictive errors between models. The package also provides methods
  for using stacking and other model weighting techniques to average
  Bayesian predictive distributions.
