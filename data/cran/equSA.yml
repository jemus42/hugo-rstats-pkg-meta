title: Learning High-Dimensional Graphical Models
maintainer: Bochao Jia
description: Provides an equivalent measure of partial correlation coefficients for
  high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying
  relationships between variables from single or multiple datasets. You can refer
  to Liang, F., Song, Q. and Qiu, P. (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1012391> for
  more detail. Based on this method, the package also provides the method for constructing
  networks for Next Generation Sequencing Data, jointly estimating multiple Gaussian
  Graphical Models, constructing single graphical model for heterogeneous dataset,
  inferring graphical models from high-dimensional missing data and estimating moral
  graph for Bayesian network.
