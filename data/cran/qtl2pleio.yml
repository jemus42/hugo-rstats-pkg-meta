title: Testing Pleiotropy in Multiparental Populations
maintainer: Frederick J Boehm
description: |-
  We implement an
  adaptation of Jiang & Zeng's (1995) <https://www.genetics.org/content/140/3/1111> likelihood ratio test for testing
  the null hypothesis of pleiotropy against the alternative hypothesis,
  two separate quantitative trait loci. The test differs from that in Jiang & Zeng (1995) <https://www.genetics.org/content/140/3/1111>
  and that in Tian et al. (2016) <doi:10.1534/genetics.115.183624> in
  that our test accommodates multiparental populations.
