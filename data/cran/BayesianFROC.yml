title: FROC Analysis by Bayesian Approaches
maintainer: Issei Tsunoda
description: 'Execute BayesianFROC::fit_GUI_Shiny() (or fit_GUI_Shiny_MRMC()) for
  a graphical user interface via Shiny. The free-response receiver operating characteristic
  (FROC) method is a generalization of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
  However, Chakraborty''s classical model is non-generative in the sense that it cannot
  synthesize data. This package aims to modify his models to be generative using a
  Bayesian approach, and to verify that our models fit practical datasets. In signal
  detection theory, the number of true positives never exceeds the number of targets.
  However, this is not explained by any existing model. Thus, in this package, the
  author contributes to FROC theory by refining Chakraborty’s model to obtain models
  that are generative. This modification allows us to use FROC analysis in a general
  statistical scheme, and as a benefit, our generative model can be applied to calculations
  of posterior predictive p values that require generation of synthetic datasets from
  fitted models. Furthermore, this package presents new models for comparison of modalities.
  Modality comparison is a common problem in radiology, and has been studied extensively.
  However, in many medical studies, such problems are addressed with non-Bayesian
  methods such as ANOVA. As a supplementary topic, this work presents a Bayesian model
  that includes individual differences. With this model, we can account for differences
  between individual readers when comparing modalities, using Bayesian rather than
  ML-methods. The author found the existing FROC model in [1] to be non-generative
  for calculation of  posterior predictive p values. Replacing the ML-based method
  with a Bayesian approach differs from standard practice but provides insight into
  the problems of existing methods. Please execute the following R scripts from the
  R (R studio) console, demo(demo_MRMC, package = "BayesianFROC"); demo(demo_srsc,
  package = "BayesianFROC"); demo(demo_stan, package = "BayesianFROC"); demo(demo_drawcurves_srsc,
  package = "BayesianFROC"); demo_Bayesian_FROC(); demo_Bayesian_FROC_without_pause().
