  Survival Data
maintainer: Miki Horiguchi
description: Performs inference of several model-free group contrast measures, which
  include difference/ratio of cumulative incidence rates at given time points, quantiles,
  and restricted mean survival times (RMST). Two kinds of covariate adjustment procedures
  (i.e., regression and augmentation) for inference of the metrics based on RMST are
  also included.
