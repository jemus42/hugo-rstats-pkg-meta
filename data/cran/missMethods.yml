  Supply functions for the creation and handling of missing data
  as well as tools to evaluate missing data methods. Nearly all possibilities

  Functions are supplied to compare parameter estimates and imputed values to
  true values to evaluate missing data methods. Evaluations of these types
  are done, for example, by Cetin-Berber et al. (2019)
  <doi:10.1177/0013164418805532>  and Kim et al. (2005)
