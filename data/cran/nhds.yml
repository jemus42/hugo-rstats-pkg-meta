  The National Hospital Discharge Survey (2010)
  summarizes the state of patients at the end of their hospital
  admissions. The US CDC publishes the data in the public domain, and
  describes it as follows: The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS)
  is a continuing nationwide sample survey of short-stay hospitals in
  the United States. The scope of NHDS encompasses patients discharged
  from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of military and Department
  of Veterans Affairs hospitals, located in the 50 States and the
  District of Columbia. Only hospitals having six or more beds for
  in-patient use are included in the survey. See
