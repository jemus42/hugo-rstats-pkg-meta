maintainer: Barret Schloerke
description: |2-

  The R package 'ggplot2' is a plotting system based on the grammar of graphics.
  'GGally' extends 'ggplot2' by adding several functions
  to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data.
  Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a two group pairwise plot
  matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to
  plot networks.
