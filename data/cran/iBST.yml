title: Improper Bagging Survival Tree
maintainer: Cyprien Mbogning
description: |-
  Fit a bagging survival tree on a mixture of population (susceptible and nonsusceptible)
  using either a pseudo R2 criterion or an adjusted Logrank criterion. The predictor is
  evaluated using the Out Of Bag Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and several scores of importance
  are computed for variable selection. The thresholds values for variable selection are
  computed using a nonparametric permutation test.
