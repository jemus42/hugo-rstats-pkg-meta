title: Causal Inference for Neuroscience
maintainer: Xi (Rossi) LUO

  while the continuous outcome measures respond at much slower time scale, for example
  event-related fMRI.  This package provide valid statistical tools with causal interpretation
  under these challenging settings, without imposing model assumptions.
