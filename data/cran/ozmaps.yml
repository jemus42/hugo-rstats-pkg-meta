description: |-
  Maps of Australian coastline and administrative regions. Data
  can be drawn or accessed directly as simple features objects. Includes
  simple functions for country or state maps of Australia and in-built data
  sets of administrative regions from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
  <https://www.abs.gov.au/>. Layers include electoral divisions and local
  government areas, simplified from the original sources but with sufficient
  detail to allow mapping of a local municipality.
