  Analysis, Seriation and Visualization of Archaeological Count
  Data
maintainer: Nicolas Frerebeau
description: |-
  An easy way to examine archaeological count data. This package
  provides a convenient and reproducible toolkit for relative and absolute
  dating and analysis of (chronological) patterns. It includes functions for
  matrix seriation (reciprocal ranking, CA-based seriation), chronological
  modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages and/or objects.
  Beyond these, the package provides several tests and measures of diversity:
  heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.),
  richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.),
  turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.).
  The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical thresholds:
  rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977) diagrams.
