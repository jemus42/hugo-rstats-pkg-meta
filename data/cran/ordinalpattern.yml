title: Tests Based on Ordinal Patterns
maintainer: Alexander Duerre
description: 'Ordinal patterns describe the dynamics of a time series by looking at
  the ranks of subsequent observations. By comparing ordinal patterns of two times
  series, Schnurr (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00362-013-0536-8> defines a robust and non-parametric
  dependence measure: the ordinal pattern coefficient. Functions to calculate this
  and a method to detect a change in the pattern coefficient proposed in Schnurr and
  Dehling (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1164706> are provided.'
