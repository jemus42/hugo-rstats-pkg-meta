description: 'Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object (2014, <doi: 10.1159/000363105>).
  The initial purpose was to create correlation structures that describe family relationships
  such as kinship and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data
  in mixed effects models, such as in the coxme function. Also includes a tool for
  pedigree drawing which is focused on producing compact layouts without intervention.
  Recent additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria,
  and kinship for the X chromosome.'
