title: Rcpp bindings for the Boost Date_Time library
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  This package provides R with access to Boost Date_Time
  functionality by using Rcpp modules.

  Functionality from Boost Date_Time for dates, durations (both for days
  and datetimes), timezones, and posix time ("ptime") is provided. The posix
  time implementation can support high-resolution of up to nano-second
  precision by using 96 bits (instead of R's 64) to present a ptime object.
