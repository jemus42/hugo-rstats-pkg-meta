  Parallel Pseudo Random Number Generator (PPRNG) 'sitmo' Header
  Files
maintainer: James Balamuta
description: |-
  Provided within are two high quality and fast PPRNGs that may be
  used in an 'OpenMP' parallel environment. In addition, there is a generator
  for one dimensional low-discrepancy sequence. The objective of this library
  to consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo' (C++98 & C++11), 'threefry' and
  'vandercorput' (C++11-only) engines on CRAN by enabling others to link to the
  header files inside of 'sitmo' instead of including a copy of each engine
  within their individual package. Lastly, the package contains example
  implementations using the 'sitmo' package and three accompanying vignette that
  provide additional information.
