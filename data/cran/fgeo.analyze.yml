title: Analyze ForestGEO Data
maintainer: Mauro Lepore
description: |-
  To help you access, transform, analyze, and
  visualize ForestGEO data, we developed a collection of R packages
  (<https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/>). This package, in particular,
  helps you to implement analyses of plot species distributions,
  topography, demography, and biomass. It also includes a torus
  translation test to determine habitat associations of tree species as
  described by Zuleta et al. (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11104-018-3878-0>. To
  learn more about ForestGEO visit <http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/>.
