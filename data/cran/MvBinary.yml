  One-Factor Distribution

description: Modelling Multivariate Binary Data with Blocks of Specific One-Factor
  Distribution. Variables are grouped into independent blocks. Each variable is described
  by two continuous parameters (its marginal probability and its dependency strength
  with the other block variables), and one binary parameter (positive or negative
  dependency). Model selection consists in the estimation of the repartition of the
  variables into blocks. It is carried out by the maximization of the BIC criterion
  by a deterministic (faster) algorithm or by a stochastic (more time consuming but
  optimal) algorithm. Tool functions facilitate the model interpretation.
