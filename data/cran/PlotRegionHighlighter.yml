description: |-
  Creates an envelope around a set of plotted points. The
  envelope is compact with a boundary that is continuous, smooth
  and convex. Each point is represented as a circle and the
  circles and connecting lines are the solution to the multiple
  pulley problem. This method can be used to highlight regions in
  a two-dimensional space.
