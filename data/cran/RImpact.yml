title: Calculates Measures of Scholarly Impact
maintainer: John Ruscio
description: |-
  The metrics() function calculates measures of scholarly impact.
  These include conventional measures, such as the number of publications
  and the total citations to all publications, as well as modern and
  robust metrics based on the vector of citations associated with each
  publication, such as the h index and many of its variants or rivals.
  These methods are described in Ruscio et al. (2012)
