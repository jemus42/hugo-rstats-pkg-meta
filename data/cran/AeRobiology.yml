description: 'Different tools for managing databases of airborne particles, elaborating
  the main calculations and visualization of results. In a first step, data are checked
  using tools for quality control and all missing gaps are completed. Then, the main

  graphical tools are available: pollen calendars, phenological plots, time series,
  tendencies, interactive plots, abundance plots...'
