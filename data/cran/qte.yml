title: Quantile Treatment Effects
maintainer: Brantly Callaway
description: Provides several methods for computing the Quantile Treatment Effect
  (QTE) and Quantile Treatment Effect on the Treated (QTT). The main cases covered
  are (i) Treatment is randomly assigned, (ii) Treatment is as good as randomly assigned
  after conditioning on some covariates (also called conditional independence or selection
  on observables) using the methods developed in Firpo (2007) <doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00738.x>,
  (iii) Identification is based on a Difference in Differences assumption (several
  varieties are available in the package e.g. Athey and Imbens (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00668.x>
