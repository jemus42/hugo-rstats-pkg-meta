title: Statistical Testing for AUC Data
maintainer: Josh Gardner
description: |-
  Performs statistical testing to compare predictive
  models based on multiple observations of the A' statistic (also known as
  Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, or AUC).
  Specifically, it implements a testing method based on the equivalence
  between the A' statistic and the Wilcoxon statistic.
  For more information, see Hanley and McNeil (1982) <doi:10.1148/radiology.143.1.7063747>.
