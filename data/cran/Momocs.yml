version: 1.3.0
title: Morphometrics using R
maintainer: Vincent Bonhomme
description: |-
  The development of this package
  is now over, it is superseded by Momocs2 and more generally MomX ecosystem.
  The goal of Momocs is to provide a complete, convenient,
  reproducible and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics.
  It includes most common 2D morphometrics approaches on outlines, open outlines,
  configurations of landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data preparation,
  manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar throughout.
  It allows reproducible, complex morphometrics analyses and other morphometrics approaches
  should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
