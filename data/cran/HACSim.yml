  Iterative Extrapolation of Species' Haplotype Accumulation
  Curves for Genetic Diversity Assessment
maintainer: Jarrett D. Phillips
description: 'Performs iterative extrapolation of species'' haplotype accumulation
  curves using a nonparametric stochastic (Monte Carlo) optimization method for assessment
  of specimen sampling completeness based on the approach of Phillips et al. (2015)
  <doi:10.1515/dna-2015-0008>, Phillips et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/ece3.4757> and
  Phillips et al. (2020) <doi: 10.7717/peerj-cs.243>. Any genomic marker can be targeted
  to assess likely required specimen sample sizes. The method is well-suited to assess
  sampling sufficiency for DNA barcoding initiatives.'
