title: Stabilizing Regression and Variable Selection
maintainer: Niklas Pfister
description: Contains an implementation of 'StabilizedRegression', a regression framework
  for heterogeneous data introduced in Pfister et al. (2019) <arXiv:1911.01850>. The
  procedure uses averaging to estimate a regression of a set of predictors X on a
  response variable Y by enforcing stability with respect to a given environment variable.
  The resulting regression leads to a variable selection procedure which allows to
  distinguish between stable and unstable predictors. The package further implements
  a visualization technique which illustrates the trade-off between stability and
  predictiveness of individual predictors.
