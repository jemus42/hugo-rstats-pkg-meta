title: A Swiss-Army Knife for Data I/O
maintainer: Thomas J. Leeper
description: |-
  Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that
  the user is probably willing to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine
  the data structure from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for
  data import and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based import is
  natively supported (including from SSL/HTTPS), compressed files can be read
  directly without explicit decompression, and fast import packages are used where
  appropriate. An additional convenience function, 'convert()', provides a simple
  method for converting between file types.
