title: Statistical Inference for MOdular NEtworks (SIMoNe)
maintainer: Julien Chiquet
description: |-
  Implements the inference of
  co-expression networks based on partial correlation
  coefficients from either steady-state or time-course
  transcriptomic data. Note that with both type of data this
  package can deal with samples collected in different
  experimental conditions and therefore not identically
  distributed. In this particular case, multiple but related
  networks are inferred on one simone run.
