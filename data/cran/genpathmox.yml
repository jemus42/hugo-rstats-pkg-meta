title: Generalized Pathmox Approach Segmentation Tree Analysis
maintainer: Giuseppe Lamberti
description: |-
  Provides a very interesting solution for
  handling segmentation variables in complex statistical methodology. It
  contains en extended version of the "Pathmox" algorithm (Lamberti, Sanchez
  and Aluja,(2016)<doi:10.1002/asmb.2168>) in the context of
  Partial Least Squares Path Modeling including the F-block
  test (to detect the responsible latent endogenous equations of the
  difference), the F-coefficient (to detect the path coefficients responsible
  of the difference) and the "invariance" test (to realize a comparison
  between the sub-models' latent variables). Furthermore, the package
  contains a generalized version of the "Pathmox" algorithm to approach
  different methodologies: linear regression and least absolute regression
  models.
