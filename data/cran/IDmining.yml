title: Intrinsic Dimension for Data Mining
maintainer: Jean Golay
description: |-
  Contains techniques for mining large and high-dimensional data
  sets by using the concept of Intrinsic Dimension (ID). Here the ID is
  not necessarily an integer. It is extended to fractal dimensions. And
  the Morisita estimator is used for the ID estimation, but other
  tools are included as well.
