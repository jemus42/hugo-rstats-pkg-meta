maintainer: Michael Kleinsasser
description: |-
  Efficient statistical inference of two-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) analysis.
  It can account for the correlated instruments and the horizontal pleiotropy,
  and can provide the accurate estimates of both causal effect and horizontal
  pleiotropy effect as well as the two corresponding p-values. There are two main
  functions in the 'PPMR' package. One is PMR_individual() for individual level data,
  the other is PMR_summary() for summary data.
