  functions of some obscure probability distributions, including the doubly non-

  upsilon distribution; the (weighted) sum of non-central chi-squares to a power;
  the (weighted) sum of log non-central chi-squares; the product of non-central
  chi-squares to powers; the product of doubly non-central F variables; the
