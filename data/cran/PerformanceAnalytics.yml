version: 2.0.4
title: Econometric Tools for Performance and Risk Analysis
maintainer: Brian G. Peterson
description: |-
  Collection of econometric functions for performance and risk
  analysis. In addition to standard risk and performance metrics, this
  package aims to aid practitioners and researchers in utilizing the latest
  research in analysis of non-normal return streams.  In general, it is most
  tested on return (rather than price) data on a regular scale, but most
  functions will work with irregular return data as well, and increasing
  numbers of functions will work with P&L or price data where possible.
