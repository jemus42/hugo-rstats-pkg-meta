title: Sample Size Computation for Fixed N with Optimal Reward
maintainer: Maurits Kaptein
description: Computes the optimal sample size for various 2-group designs (e.g., when
  comparing the means of two groups assuming equal variances, unequal variances, or
  comparing proportions) when the aim is to maximize the rewards over the full decision
  procedure of a) running a trial (with the computed sample size), and b) subsequently
  administering the winning treatment to the remaining N-n units in the population.
  Sample sizes and expected rewards for standard t- and z- tests are also provided.
