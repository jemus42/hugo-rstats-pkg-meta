  Multi-Modal Similarity Matrix Factorization for Integrative
  Multi-Omics Data Analysis
maintainer: Xiaoyao Yin
description: |-
  A new method to implement clustering from multiple modality data of certain samples,
  the function M2SMF() jointly factorizes multiple similarity matrices into a shared sub-matrix
  and several modality private sub-matrices, which is further used for clustering. Along with
  this method, we also provide function to calculate the similarity matrix and function to
  evaluate the best cluster number from the original data.
