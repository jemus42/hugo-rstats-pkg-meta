title: Abstractions for Promise-Based Asynchronous Programming
maintainer: Joe Cheng
description: |-
  Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous programming
  in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing a single
  R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background while also attending
  to something else. Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a
  syntax that is idiomatic R.
