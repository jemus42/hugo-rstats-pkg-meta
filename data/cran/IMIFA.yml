  Infinite Mixtures of Infinite Factor Analysers and Related

maintainer: Keefe Murphy
description: Provides flexible Bayesian estimation of Infinite Mixtures of Infinite
  Factor Analysers and related models, for nonparametrically clustering high-dimensional
  data, introduced by Murphy et al. (2019) <doi:10.1214/19-BA1179>. The IMIFA model
  conducts Bayesian nonparametric model-based clustering with factor analytic covariance
  structures without recourse to model selection criteria to choose the number of
  clusters or cluster-specific latent factors, mostly via efficient Gibbs updates.
  Model-specific diagnostic tools are also provided, as well as many options for plotting
  results, conducting posterior inference on parameters of interest, posterior predictive
  checking, and quantifying uncertainty.
