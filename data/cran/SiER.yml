  Signal Extraction Approach for Sparse Multivariate Response
  Regression
maintainer: Ruiyan Luo
description: Methods for regression with high-dimensional predictors and  univariate
  or maltivariate response variables. It considers the decomposition of the coefficient
  matrix that leads to the best approximation to the signal part in the response given
  any rank, and estimates the decomposition by solving a penalized generalized eigenvalue
  problem followed by a least squares procedure. Ruiyan Luo and Xin Qi (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.09.005>.
