title: Genome-Wide RNA Degradation Analysis Using BRIC-Seq Data
maintainer: Naoto Imamachi
description: |-
  BRIC-seq is a genome-wide approach for determining RNA stability in mammalian cells.
  This package provides a series of functions for performing quality check of your BRIC-seq data,
  calculation of RNA half-life for each transcript and comparison of RNA half-lives between two conditions.
