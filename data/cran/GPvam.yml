  Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Multiple Membership Mixed
  Models Used in Value-Added Modeling
maintainer: Andrew Karl
description: An EM algorithm, Karl et al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.004>,
  is used to estimate the generalized, variable, and complete persistence models,
  Mariano et al. (2010) <doi:10.3102/1076998609346967>. These are multiple-membership
  linear mixed models with teachers modeled as "G-side" effects and students modeled
  with either "G-side" or "R-side" effects.
