title: Important Concepts of Cooperative Game Theory
maintainer: Jochen Staudacher
description: |-
  The theory of cooperative games with transferable utility offers
  useful insights into the way parties can share gains from cooperation and
  secure sustainable agreements, see e.g. one of the books by Chakravarty,
  Mitra and Sarkar (2015, ISBN:978-1107058798) or by Driessen (1988,
  ISBN:978-9027727299) for more details. A comprehensive set of tools for
  cooperative game theory with transferable utility is provided. Users can
  create special families of cooperative games, like e.g. bankruptcy games,
  cost sharing games and weighted voting games. There are functions to check
  various game properties and to compute five different set-valued solution
  concepts for cooperative games. A large number of point-valued solution
  concepts is available reflecting the diverse application areas of
  cooperative game theory. Some of these point-valued solution concepts can
  be used to analyze weighted voting games and measure the influence of
  individual voters within a voting body. There are routines for visualizing
  both set-valued and point-valued solutions in the case of three or four
  players.
