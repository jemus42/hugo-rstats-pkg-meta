description: A set of asymptotic methods that can be used to directly estimate the
  expected (Fisher) information matrix by Liu, Tian, and Xin (2016) <doi:10.3102/1076998615621293>
  in diagnostic classification models or cognitive diagnostic models are provided
  when marginal maximum likelihood estimation is used. For these methods, both the
  item and structural model parameters are considered simultaneously. Specifically,
  the observed information matrix, the empirical cross-product information matrix
  and the sandwich-type co-variance matrix that can be used to estimate the asymptotic
  co-variance matrix (or the model parameter standard errors) within the context of
  diagnostic classification models are provided.
