title: Guided Correction Approach for Inherited bias (GCAI.bias)
maintainer: Guoshuai Cai
description: Many inherited biases and effects exists in RNA-seq due to both biological
  and technical effects. We observed the biological variance of testing target transcripts
  can influence the yield of sequencing reads, which might indicate a resource competition
  existing in RNA-seq. We developed this package to capture the bias depending on
  local sequence and perform the correction of this type of bias by borrowing information
  from spike-in measurement.
