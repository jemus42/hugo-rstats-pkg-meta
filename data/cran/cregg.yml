maintainer: Thomas J. Leeper
description: Simple tidying, analysis, and visualization of conjoint (factorial) experiments,
  including estimation and visualization of average marginal component effects ('AMCEs')
  and marginal means ('MMs') for weighted and un-weighted survey data, along with
  useful reference category diagnostics and statistical tests. Estimation of 'AMCEs'
  is based upon methods described by Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto (2014) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpt024>.
