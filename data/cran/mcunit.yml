title: Unit Tests for MC Methods
maintainer: Axel Gandy
description: Unit testing for Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC) methods, are implemented as extensions of the 'testthat' package. The
  MCMC methods check whether the MCMC chain has the correct invariant distribution.
  They do not check other properties of successful samplers such as whether the chain
  can reach all points, i.e. whether is recurrent. The tests require the ability to
  sample from the prior and to run steps of the MCMC chain. The methodology is described
  in Gandy and Scott (2020) <arXiv:2001.06465>.
