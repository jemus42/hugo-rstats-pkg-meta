title: Exact Tests and Confidence Intervals for 2x2 Tables
maintainer: Michael P. Fay
description: Calculates conditional exact tests (Fisher's exact test, Blaker's exact
  test, or  exact McNemar's test) and unconditional exact tests (including score-based
  tests on differences in proportions, ratios of proportions, and odds ratios, and
  Boshcloo's test) with appropriate matching confidence intervals, and provides power
  and sample size calculations. Gives melded confidence intervals for the binomial
  case. Gives boundary-optimized rejection region test (Gabriel, et al, 2018, <DOI:10.1002/sim.7579>),
  an unconditional exact test for the situation where the controls are all expected
  to fail.
