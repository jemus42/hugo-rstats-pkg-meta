title: Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease Dynamics
maintainer: Samuel Jenness
description: |-
  Tools for simulating mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics.
  Epidemic model classes include deterministic compartmental models, stochastic
  individual-contact models, and stochastic network models. Network models use the
  robust statistical methods of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs)
  from the Statnet suite of software packages in R. Standard templates for epidemic
  modeling include SI, SIR, and SIS disease types. EpiModel features
  an API for extending these templates to address novel scientific research aims.
