title: MCMC Sampling of Gene Genealogies Conditional on Genetic Data
maintainer: Kelly Burkett
description: Sample ancestral trees conditional on phased or unphased SNP genotype
  data. The actual tree sampling is done using a C++ program that is launched within
  R. The package also contains functions for specifying the tree-sampling settings
  (pre-processing) and for storing and manipulating the sampled trees (post-processing).
