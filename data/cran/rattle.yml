title: Graphical User Interface for Data Science in R
maintainer: Graham Williams
description: |-
  The R Analytic Tool To Learn Easily (Rattle) provides a
  collection of utilities functions for the data scientist. A
  Gnome (RGtk2) based graphical interface is included with
  the aim to provide a simple and intuitive introduction to R
  for data science, allowing a user to quickly load data from a CSV file
  (or via ODBC), transform and explore the data,
  build and evaluate models, and export models as PMML (predictive
  modelling markup language) or as scores. A key aspect of the GUI
  is that all R commands are logged and commented through the log tab.
  This can be saved as a standalone R script file and as
  an aid for the user to
  learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R itself.
