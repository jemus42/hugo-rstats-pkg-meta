title: Robust Methods for Epistasis Detection
maintainer: Lotfi Slim
description: |-
  Functions to perform robust epistasis detection in genome-wide
  association studies, as described in Slim et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/442749>.
  The implemented methods identify pairwise interactions between a particular
  target variant and the rest of the genotype, using a propensity score
  approach. The propensity score models the linkage disequilibrium between the
  target and the rest of the genotype. All methods are penalized regression
  approaches, which differently incorporate the propensity score to only
  recover the synergistic effects between the target and the genotype.
