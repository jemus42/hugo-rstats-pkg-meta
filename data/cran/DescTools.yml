title: Tools for Descriptive Statistics
maintainer: Andri Signorell
description: A collection of miscellaneous basic statistic functions and convenience
  wrappers for efficiently describing data. The author's intention was to create a
  toolbox, which facilitates the (notoriously time consuming) first descriptive tasks
  in data analysis, consisting of calculating descriptive statistics, drawing graphical
  summaries and reporting the results. The package contains furthermore functions
  to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data
  from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages
  and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them
  here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages
  (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and
  to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming,
  NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as
  naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'BigCamelCase' style was
  consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well.
