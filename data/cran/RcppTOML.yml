title: '''Rcpp'' Bindings to Parser for Tom''s Obvious Markup Language'
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
  "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
  <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>) suitable for both human editing as well
  as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
  connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R.
