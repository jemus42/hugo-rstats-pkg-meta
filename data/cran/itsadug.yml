title: Interpreting Time Series and Autocorrelated Data Using GAMMs
maintainer: Jacolien van Rij
description: |-
  GAMM (Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling; Lin & Zhang, 1999)
  as implemented in the R package 'mgcv' (Wood, S.N., 2006; 2011) is a nonlinear
  regression analysis which is particularly useful for time course data such as
  EEG, pupil dilation, gaze data (eye tracking), and articulography recordings,
  but also for behavioral data such as reaction times and response data. As time
  course measures are sensitive to autocorrelation problems, GAMMs implements
  methods to reduce the autocorrelation problems. This package includes functions
  for the evaluation of GAMM models (e.g., model comparisons, determining regions
  of significance, inspection of autocorrelational structure in residuals)
  and interpreting of GAMMs (e.g., visualization of complex interactions, and
  contrasts).
