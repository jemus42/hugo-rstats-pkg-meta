title: Ratio-of-Uniforms Simulation with Transformation
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Uses the generalized ratio-of-uniforms (RU) method to simulate
  from univariate and (low-dimensional) multivariate continuous distributions.
  The user specifies the log-density, up to an additive constant. The RU
  algorithm is applied after relocation of mode of the density to zero, and
  the user can choose a tuning parameter r. For details see Wakefield, Gelfand
  and Smith (1991) <DOI:10.1007/BF01889987>, Efficient generation of random
  variates via the ratio-of-uniforms method, Statistics and Computing (1991)
  1, 129-133.  A Box-Cox variable transformation can be used to make the input
  density suitable for the RU method and to improve efficiency.  In the
  multivariate case rotation of axes can also be used to improve efficiency.
  From version 1.2.0 the 'Rcpp' package
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp> can be used to improve efficiency.
