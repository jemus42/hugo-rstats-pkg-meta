title: Make Banner Comments with a Consistent Format
maintainer: Bill Venables
description: |-
  A convenience package for use while drafting code.
  It facilitates making stand-out comment lines decorated with
  bands of characters.  The input text strings are converted into
  R comment lines, suitably formatted. These are then displayed in
  a console window and, if possible, automatically transferred to a
  clipboard ready for pasting into an R script.  Designed to save
  time when drafting R scripts that will need to be navigated and
  maintained by other programmers.
