  Bayesian Nonparametric Spectral Density Estimation Using
  B-Spline Priors
maintainer: Matthew C. Edwards
description: Implementation of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs MCMC algorithm to flexibly
  estimate the spectral density of a stationary time series.  The algorithm updates
  a nonparametric B-spline prior using the Whittle likelihood to produce pseudo-posterior
  samples and is based on the work presented in Edwards, M.C., Meyer, R. and Christensen,
  N., Statistics and Computing (2018). <doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9796-9>.
