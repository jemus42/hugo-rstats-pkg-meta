title: Scaling Count and Binary Data with Sparse Factor Analysis
maintainer: Marc Ratkovic
description: Multidimensional scaling provides a means of uncovering a latent structure
  underlying observed data, while estimating the number of latent dimensions.  This
  package presents a means for scaling binary and count data, for example the votes
  and word counts for legislators.  Future work will include an EM implementation
  and extend this work to ordinal and continuous data.
