title: Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters
maintainer: Ahmed N. Albatineh
description: |-
  Identifies the optimal number of clusters by calculating the similarity between
  two clustering methods at the same number of clusters using the corrected indices of Rand and
  Jaccard as described in Albatineh and Niewiadomska-Bugaj (2011). The number of clusters at
  which the index attain its maximum more frequently is a candidate for being the optimal
  number of clusters.
