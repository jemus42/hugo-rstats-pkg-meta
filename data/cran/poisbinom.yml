title: A Faster Implementation of the Poisson-Binomial Distribution
maintainer: Santiago Olivella
description: Provides the probability, distribution, and quantile functions and random
  number generator for the Poisson-Binomial distribution.  This package relies on
  FFTW to implement the discrete Fourier transform, so that it is much faster than
  the existing implementation of the same algorithm in R.
