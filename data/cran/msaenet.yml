description: |-
  Multi-step adaptive elastic-net (MSAENet) algorithm for
  feature selection in high-dimensional regressions proposed in
  Xiao and Xu (2015) <DOI:10.1080/00949655.2015.1016944>,
  with support for multi-step adaptive MCP-net (MSAMNet) and
  multi-step adaptive SCAD-net (MSASNet) methods.
