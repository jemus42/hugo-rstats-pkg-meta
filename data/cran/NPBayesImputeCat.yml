title: Non-Parametric Bayesian Multiple Imputation for Categorical Data
maintainer: Jingchen Hu
description: These routines create multiple imputations of missing at random categorical
  data, and create multiply imputed synthesis of categorical data, with or without
  structural zeros. Imputations and syntheses are based on Dirichlet process mixtures
  of multinomial distributions, which is a non-parametric Bayesian modeling approach
  that allows for flexible joint modeling, described in Manrique-Vallier and Reiter
  (2014) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2013.844700>.
