title: Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution and Its Special Cases
maintainer: Marc Weibel
description: |-
  Detailed functionality for working
  with the univariate and multivariate Generalized Hyperbolic
  distribution and its special cases (Hyperbolic (hyp), Normal
  Inverse Gaussian (NIG), Variance Gamma (VG), skewed Student-t
  and Gaussian distribution). Especially, it contains fitting
  procedures, an AIC-based model selection routine, and functions
  for the computation of density, quantile, probability, random
  variates, expected shortfall and some portfolio optimization
  and plotting routines as well as the likelihood ratio test. In
  addition, it contains the Generalized Inverse Gaussian
  distribution. See Chapter 3 of A. J. McNeil, R. Frey, and P. Embrechts.
