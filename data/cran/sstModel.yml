description: |-
  Framework for the implementation of solvency related computations based on
  standard models for the Swiss Solvency Test (SST), a risk-based capital standard for Swiss
  insurance companies. Allows Monte Carlo simulation of market risk, some insurance risks and
  their aggregation. Additional toolbox for preprocessing computations. Convenient 'shiny' GUI
  combined with a parser for an input 'excel' (.xlsx) template to simplify model configuration,
  data fill-in and results visualization.
