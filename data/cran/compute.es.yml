title: Compute Effect Sizes
maintainer: AC Del Re
description: |-
  Several functions are available for calculating the most
  widely used effect sizes (ES), along with their variances, confidence
  intervals and p-values.  The output includes ES's of d (mean difference), g
  (unbiased estimate of d), r (correlation coefficient), z' (Fisher's z), and
  OR (odds ratio and log odds ratio). In addition, NNT (number needed to
  treat), U3, CLES (Common Language Effect Size) and Cliff's Delta are
  computed. This package uses recommended formulas as described in The
  Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, &
  Valentine, 2009).
