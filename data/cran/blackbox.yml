title: Black Box Optimization and Exploration of Parameter Space
maintainer: Fran√ßois Rousset
description: Performs prediction of a response function from simulated response values,
  allowing black-box optimization of functions estimated with some error. Includes
  a simple user interface for such applications, as well as more specialized functions
  designed to be called by the Migraine software (Rousset and Leblois, 2012 <doi:10.1093/molbev/MSR262>;
  Leblois et al., 2014 <doi:10.1093/molbev/msu212>; and see URL). The latter functions
  are used for prediction of likelihood surfaces and implied likelihood ratio confidence
  intervals, and for exploration of predictor space of the surface. Prediction of
  the response is based on ordinary Kriging (with residual error) of the input. Estimation
  of smoothing parameters is performed by generalized cross-validation.
