  Network Reverse Engineering with Approximate Bayesian
  Computation
maintainer: Frederic Bertrand
description: We developed an inference tool based on approximate Bayesian computation
  to decipher network data and assess the strength of the inferred links between network's
  actors. It is a new multi-level approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach.
  At the first level, the method captures the global properties of the network, such
  as scale-freeness and clustering coefficients, whereas the second level is targeted
  to capture local properties, including the probability of each couple of genes being
  linked. Up to now, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms have been scarcely
  used in that setting and, due to the computational overhead, their application was
  limited to a small number of genes. On the contrary, our algorithm was made to cope
  with that issue and has low computational cost. It can be used, for instance, for
  elucidating gene regulatory network, which is an important step towards understanding
  the normal cell physiology and complex pathological phenotype. Reverse-engineering
  consists in using gene expressions over time or over different experimental conditions
  to discover the structure of the gene network in a targeted cellular process. The
  fact that gene expression data are usually noisy, highly correlated, and have high
  dimensionality explains the need for specific statistical methods to reverse engineer
  the underlying network.
