  Diversification Rate Estimation and Fast Simulation of
  Reconstructed Phylogenetic Trees under Tree-Wide
  Time-Heterogeneous Birth-Death Processes Including
  Mass-Extinction Events
maintainer: Sebastian Hoehna
description: Simulation of reconstructed phylogenetic trees under tree-wide time-heterogeneous
  birth-death processes and estimation of diversification parameters under the same
  model. Speciation and extinction rates can be any function of time and mass-extinction
  events at specific times can be provided. Trees can be simulated either conditioned
  on the number of species, the time of the process, or both. Additionally, the likelihood
  equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood
  (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.
