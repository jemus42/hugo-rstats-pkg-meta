title: A Collection of Graphon Estimation Methods
maintainer: Kisung You
description: |-
  Provides a not-so-comprehensive list of methods for estimating graphon,
  a symmetric measurable function, from a single or multiple of observed networks.
  For a detailed introduction on graphon and popular estimation techniques,
  see the paper by Orbanz, P. and Roy, D.M.(2014) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2334607>.
  It also contains several auxiliary functions for generating sample networks
  using various network models and graphons.
