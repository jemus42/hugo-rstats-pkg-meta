title: Sparse Additive Modelling
maintainer: Haoming Jiang
description: |-
  Computationally efficient tools for high dimensional predictive
  modeling (regression and classification). SAM is short for sparse
  additive modeling, and adopts the computationally efficient basis
  spline technique. We solve  the optimization problems by various
  computational algorithms including the block coordinate descent
  algorithm, fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and newton method.
  The computation is further accelerated by warm-start and active-set tricks.
