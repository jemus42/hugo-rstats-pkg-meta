title: Build, Import and Export GEXF Graph Files
maintainer: George Vega Yon
description: |-
  Create, read and write 'GEXF' (Graph Exchange 'XML' Format) graph
  files (used in 'Gephi' and others). Using the 'XML' package, it allows the user to
  easily build/read graph files including attributes, 'GEXF' visual attributes (such
  as color, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and
  edge weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively
  through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through 'gexf-js' (a
  'javascript' library) and interact with the 'igraph' package.
