title: Ranked Set Sampling
maintainer: Busra Sevinc
description: Ranked set sampling (RSS) is introduced as an advanced method for data
  collection which is substantial for the statistical and methodological analysis
  in scientific studies by McIntyre (1952) (reprinted in 2005) <doi:10.1198/000313005X54180>.
  This package introduces the first package  that implements the RSS and its modified
  versions for sampling. With 'RSSampling', the researchers can sample with basic
  RSS and the modified versions, namely, Median RSS, Extreme RSS, Percentile RSS,
  Balanced groups RSS, Double RSS, L-RSS, Truncation-based RSS, Robust extreme RSS.
  The 'RSSampling' also allows imperfect ranking using an auxiliary variable (concomitant)
  which is widely used in the real life applications. Applicants can also use this
  package for parametric and nonparametric inference such as mean, median and variance
  estimation, regression analysis and some distribution-free tests where the the samples
  are obtained via basic RSS.
