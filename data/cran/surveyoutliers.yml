title: Helps Manage Outliers in Sample Surveys
maintainer: '"Robert Clark"'
description: At present, the only functionality is the calculation of optimal one-sided
  winsorizing cutoffs. The main function is optimal.onesided.cutoff.bygroup. It calculates
  the optimal tuning parameter for one-sided winsorisation, and so calculates winsorised
  values for a variable of interest. See the help file for this function for more
  details and an example.
