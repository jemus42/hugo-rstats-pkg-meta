  Inference of Parameters of Normal Distributions from a Mixture
  of Normals
maintainer: Luis M. Avila
description: |-
  This MCMC method takes a data numeric vector (Y) and assigns the elements of Y
  to a (potentially infinite) number of normal distributions. The individual normal distributions from a mixture of normals can be inferred.
  Following the method described in Escobar (1994) <doi:10.2307/2291223> we use a Dirichlet Process Prior (DPP) to describe stochastically our prior assumptions about the dimensionality of the data.
