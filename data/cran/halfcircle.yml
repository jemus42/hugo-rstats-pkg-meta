title: Plot Halfcircle Diagram
maintainer: Sohyun Park
description: There are growing concerns on flow data in diverse fields including trade,
  migration, knowledge diffusion, disease spread, and transportation. The package
  is an effective visual support to learn the pattern of flow which is called halfcircle
  diagram. The flow between two nodes placed on the center line of a circle is represented
  using a half circle drawn from the origin to the destination in a clockwise direction.
  Through changing the order of nodes, the halfcircle diagram enables users to examine
  the complex relationship between bidirectional flow and each potential determinants.
  Furthermore, the halfmeancenter function, which calculates (un) weighted mean center
  of half circles, makes the comparison easier.
