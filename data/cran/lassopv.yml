title: Nonparametric P-Value Estimation for Predictors in Lasso
maintainer: Lingfei Wang
description: 'Estimate the p-values for predictors x against target variable y in
  lasso regression, using the regularization strength when each predictor enters the
  active set of regularization path for the first time as the statistic. This is based
  on the assumption that predictors (of the same variance) that (first) become active
  earlier tend to be more significant. Three null distributions are supported: normal
  and spherical, which are computed separately for each predictor and analytically
  under approximation, which aims at efficiency and accuracy for small p-values.'
