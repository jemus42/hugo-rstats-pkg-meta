title: Least-Squares Means
maintainer: Russell Lenth
description: |-
  Obtain least-squares means for linear, generalized linear,
  and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of
  least-squares means, and comparisons of slopes.
  Plots and compact letter displays. Least-squares means were proposed in
  Harvey, W (1960) "Least-squares analysis of data with unequal subclass numbers",
  Tech Report ARS-20-8, USDA National Agricultural Library, and discussed
  further in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) "Population marginal means
  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means",
  The American Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>.
  NOTE: lsmeans now relies primarily on code in the 'emmeans' package.
  'lsmeans' will be archived in the near future.
