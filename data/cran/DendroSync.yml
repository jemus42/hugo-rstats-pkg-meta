  A Set of Tools for Calculating Spatial Synchrony Between
  Tree-Ring Chronologies
maintainer: Josu G. Alday
description: |-
  Provides functions for the calculation and plotting of synchrony in
  tree growth from tree-ring width chronologies (TRW index). It combines
  variance-covariance (VCOV) mixed modelling with functions that quantify
  the degree to which the TRW chronologies contain a common temporal
  signal. It also implements temporal trends in spatial synchrony using a
  moving window. These methods can also be used with other kind of ecological
  variables that have temporal autocorrelation corrected.
