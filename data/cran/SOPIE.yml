title: Non-Parametric Estimation of the Off-Pulse Interval of a Pulsar
maintainer: Willem Daniel Schutte
description: |-
  Provides functions to non-parametrically estimate the off-pulse interval of a source
  function originating from a pulsar. The technique is based on a sequential application of P-values
  obtained from goodness-of-fit tests for the uniform distribution, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling and Rayleigh goodness-of-fit tests.
