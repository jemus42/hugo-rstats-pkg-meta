title: Parse Eye-Tracking Data into Fixations
maintainer: Daan van Renswoude
description: Eye-tracking data must be transformed into fixations and saccades before
  it can be analyzed. This package provides a non-parametric speed-based approach
  to do this on a trial basis. The method is especially useful when there are large
  differences in data quality, as the thresholds are adjusted accordingly. The same
  pre-processing procedure can be applied to all participants, while accounting for
  individual differences in data quality.
