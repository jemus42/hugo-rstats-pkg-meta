title: Mountain Plots, Folded Empirical Cumulative Distribution Plots
maintainer: Kevin Wright
description: |-
  Lattice functions for drawing folded empirical cumulative
  distribution plots, or mountain plots. A mountain plot is similar
  to an empirical CDF plot, except that the curve increases from
  0 to 0.5, then decreases from 0.5 to 1 using an inverted scale at
  the right side.
