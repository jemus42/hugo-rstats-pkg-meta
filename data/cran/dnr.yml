  Simulate Dynamic Networks using Exponential Random Graph Models
  (ERGM) Family
maintainer: Abhirup Mallik
description: |-
  Functions are provided to fit temporal lag models to dynamic
  networks. The models are build on top of exponential random graph models (ERGM) framework. There are
  functions for simulating or forecasting networks for future time points.
  Stable Multiple Time Step Simulation/Prediction from Lagged Dynamic Network Regression Models. Mallik, Almquist (2017, under review).
