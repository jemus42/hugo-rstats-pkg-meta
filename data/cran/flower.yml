title: Tools for characterizing flowering traits
maintainer: Xie WANG
description: Flowering is an important life history trait of flowering plants. It
  has been mainly analyzed with respect to flowering onset and duration of flowering.
  This tools provide some functions to compute the temporal distribution of an flowering
  individual related to other population members. fCV() measures the temporal variation
  in flowering. RIind() measures the rank order of flowering for individual plants
  within a population. SI(), SI2(), SI3(), and SI4() calculate flowering synchrony
  with different methods.
