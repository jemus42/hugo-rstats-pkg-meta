title: Smooth Estimation of GPD Shape Parameter
maintainer: Kaspar Rufibach
description: Given independent and identically distributed observations X(1), ...,
  X(n) from a Generalized Pareto distribution with shape parameter gamma in [-1,0],
  offers several estimates to compute estimates of gamma. The estimates are based
  on the principle of replacing the order statistics by quantiles of a distribution
  function based on a log--concave density function. This procedure is justified by
  the fact that the GPD density is log--concave for gamma in [-1,0].
