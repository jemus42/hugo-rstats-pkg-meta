title: Biomarker Prognostic Enrichment Tool
maintainer: Jeremy Roth
description: Prognostic Enrichment is a clinical trial strategy of evaluating an intervention
  in a patient population with a higher rate of the unwanted event than the broader
  patient population (R. Temple (2010) <DOI:10.1038/clpt.2010.233>). A higher event
  rate translates to a lower sample size for the clinical trial, which can have both
  practical and ethical advantages. This package is a tool to help evaluate biomarkers
  for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials.
