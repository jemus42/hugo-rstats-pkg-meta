description: Data sets and functions for chi-squared Hardy-Weinberg and case-control
  association tests of highly polymorphic genetic data [e.g., human leukocyte antigen
  (HLA) data]. Performs association tests at multiple levels of polymorphism (haplotype,
  locus and HLA amino-acids) as described in Pappas DJ, Marin W, Hollenbach JA, Mack
  SJ (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.humimm.2015.12.006>. Combines rare variants to a common
  class to account for sparse cells in tables as described by Hollenbach JA, Mack
  SJ, Thomson G, Gourraud PA (2012) <doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-842-9_14>.
