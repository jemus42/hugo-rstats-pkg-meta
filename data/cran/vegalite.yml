  Tools to Encode Visualizations with the 'Grammar of
  Graphics'-Like 'Vega-Lite' 'Spec'
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  The 'Vega-Lite' 'JavaScript' framework provides a higher-level grammar
  for visual analysis, akin to 'ggplot' or 'Tableau', that generates complete 'Vega'
  specifications. Functions exist which enable building a valid 'spec' from scratch
  or importing a previously created 'spec' file. Functions also exist to export 'spec'
  files and to generate code which will enable plots to be embedded in properly
  configured web pages. The default behavior is to generate an 'htmlwidget'.
