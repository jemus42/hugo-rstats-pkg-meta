title: R Interface to the DataONE REST API
maintainer: Matthew B. Jones
description: |-
  Provides read and write access to data and metadata from
  the DataONE network <https://www.dataone.org> of data repositories.
  Each DataONE repository implements a consistent repository application
  programming interface. Users call methods in R to access these remote
  repository functions, such as methods to query the metadata catalog, get
  access to metadata for particular data packages, and read the data objects
  from the data repository. Users can also insert and update data objects on
  repositories that support these methods.
