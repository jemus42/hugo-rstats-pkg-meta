title: Distance-Sampling Analyses for Density and Abundance Estimation
maintainer: Trent McDonald
description: |-
  Distance-sampling is a popular method for estimating density and
  abundance of organisms in ecology. Rdistance contains routines that
  assist with analysis of
  distance-sampling data collected on point or line transects.
  Distance models are specified using regression-like formula (similar
  to lm, glm, etc.). Abundance routines
  perform automated bootstrapping and automated detection-function
  selection. Overall (study area) and site-level (transect or point)
  abundance estimates are available. A large suite of classical,
  parametric detection functions are
  included along with some uncommon parametric
  functions (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential) and non-parametric
  smoothed distance functions. Custom (user-defined) detection functions
  are easily implemented (see vignette).
  The help files and vignettes have been
  vetted by multiple authors and tested in workshop
  settings.
