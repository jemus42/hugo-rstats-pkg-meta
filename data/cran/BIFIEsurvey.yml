maintainer: Alexander Robitzsch
description: |2-

  Contains tools for survey statistics (especially in educational
  assessment) for datasets with replication designs (jackknife,
  bootstrap, replicate weights; see Kolenikov, 2010;
  Pfefferman & Rao, 2009a, 2009b, <doi:10.1016/S0169-7161(09)70003-3>,
  <doi:10.1016/S0169-7161(09)70037-9>); Shao, 1996,
  <doi:10.1080/02331889708802523>).
  Descriptive statistics, linear and logistic regression,
  path models for manifest variables with measurement error
  correction and two-level hierarchical regressions for weighted
  samples are included. Statistical inference can be conducted for
  multiply imputed datasets and nested multiply imputed datasets
  and is in particularly suited for the analysis of plausible values
  (for details see George, Oberwimmer & Itzlinger-Bruneforth, 2016;
  Bruneforth, Oberwimmer & Robitzsch, 2016; Robitzsch, Pham &
  Yanagida, 2016; <doi:10.17888/fdb-demo:bistE813I-16a>).
  The package development was supported by BIFIE (Federal Institute for
  Educational Research, Innovation and Development of the Austrian
  School System; Salzburg, Austria).
