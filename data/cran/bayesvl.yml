  Visually Learning the Graphical Structure of Bayesian Networks
  and Performing MCMC with 'Stan'
maintainer: Viet-Phuong La
description: 'Provides users with its associated functions for pedagogical purposes
  in visually learning Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations.
  It enables users to: a) Create and examine the (starting) graphical structure of
  Bayesian networks; b) Create random Bayesian networks using a dataset with customized
  constraints; c) Generate ''Stan'' code for structures of Bayesian networks for sampling
  the data and learning parameters; d) Plot the network graphs; e) Perform Markov
  chain Monte Carlo computations and produce graphs for posteriors checks. The package
  refers to one reference item, which describes the methods and algorithms: Vuong,
  Quan-Hoang and La, Viet-Phuong (2019) <doi:10.31219/osf.io/w5dx6> The ''bayesvl''
  R package. Open Science Framework (May 18).'
