title: eBird Data Extraction and Processing in R
maintainer: Matthew Strimas-Mackey
description: |-
  Extract and process bird sightings records from
  eBird (<http://ebird.org>), an online tool for recording bird
  observations.  Public access to the full eBird database is via the
  eBird Basic Dataset (EBD; see <http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download>
  for access), a downloadable text file. This package is an interface to
  AWK for extracting data from the EBD based on taxonomic, spatial, or
  temporal filters, to produce a manageable file size that can be
  imported into R.
