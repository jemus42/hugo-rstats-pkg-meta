title: Generalized Nonlinear Models
maintainer: Heather Turner
description: Functions to specify and fit generalized nonlinear models, including
  models with multiplicative interaction terms such as the UNIDIFF model from sociology
  and the AMMI model from crop science, and many others.  Over-parameterized representations
  of models are used throughout; functions are provided for inference on estimable
  parameter combinations, as well as standard methods for diagnostics etc.
