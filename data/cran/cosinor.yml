title: Tools for estimating and predicting the cosinor model
maintainer: Michael Sachs
description: cosinor is a set of simple functions that transforms longitudinal<U+000a>data
  to estimate the cosinor linear model as described in Tong (1976).<U+000a>Methods
  are given to summarize the mean, amplitude and acrophase, to<U+000a>predict the
  mean annual outcome value, and to test the coefficients.
