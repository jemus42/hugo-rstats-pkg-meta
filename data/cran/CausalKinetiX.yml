title: Learning Stable Structures in Kinetic Systems
maintainer: Niklas Pfister
description: Implementation of 'CausalKinetiX', a framework for learning stable structures
  in kinetic systems. Apart from the main functions CausalKinetiX() and CausalKinetiX.modelranking()
  it includes functions to generate data from three simulations models, which can
  be used to benchmark structure learning methods for linear ordinary differential
  equation models. A detailed description of the underlying methods as well as details
  on the examples are given in Pfister, Bauer and Peters (2018) <arXiv:1810.11776>.
