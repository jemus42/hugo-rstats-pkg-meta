title: Base Package for 'Outsider'
maintainer: Dom Bennett
description: |-
  Base package for 'outsider' <https://github.com/ropensci/outsider>.
  The 'outsider' package and its sister packages enable the installation and
  running of external, command-line software within R. This base package is a
  key dependency of the user-facing 'outsider' package as it provides the
  utilities for interfacing between 'Docker' <https://www.docker.com> and R.
  It is intended that end-users of 'outsider' do not directly work with this
  base package.
