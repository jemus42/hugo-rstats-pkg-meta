  for hierarchical data
maintainer: Kari Tokola
description: HierO is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for calculating optimal
  statistical power and sample size for hierarchical data structure. HierO constructs
  a user defined sample size optimization problem to GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling
  System)form and uses Rneos package to send the problem to NEOS server for solving.
