title: Imputation of Time Series Based on Dynamic Time Warping
maintainer: Emilie Poisson-Caillault
description: Functions to impute large gaps within time series based on Dynamic Time
  Warping methods. It contains all required functions to create large missing consecutive
  values within time series and to fill them, according to the paper Phan et al. (2017),
  <DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2017.08.019>. Performance criteria are added to compare similarity
  between two signals (query and reference).
