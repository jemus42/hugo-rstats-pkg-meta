title: Dynamic Bayesian Network Learning and Inference
maintainer: David Quesada
description: |-
  Learning and inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary
  Markovian order.  Extends some of the functionality offered by the 'bnlearn'
  package to learn the networks from data and perform exact inference.
  It offers a modification of Trabelsi (2013) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-41398-8_34>
  dynamic max-min hill climbing algorithm for structure learning and
  the possibility to perform forecasts of arbitrary length. A tool for
  visualizing the structure of the net is also provided via the 'visNetwork' package.
