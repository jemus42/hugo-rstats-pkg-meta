version: '1.0'
title: View Medical Research Images using the Papaya JavaScript Library
maintainer: John Muschelli
description: |-
  Users pass images and objects of class 'nifti' from the 'oro.nifti'
  package to a Papaya, an interactive lightweight JavaScript viewer.
  Although many packages can view individual slices or projections of
  image and matrix data, this package allows for quick and easy
  interactive browsing of images.  The viewer is based off of the
  Mango software, which is a lightweight medical image viewer.
