  Various Functions to Facilitate Visualization of Data and
  Analysis
maintainer: Jacolien van Rij
description: 'When analyzing data, plots are a helpful tool for visualizing data and
  interpreting statistical models. This package provides a set of simple tools for
  building plots incrementally, starting with an empty plot region, and adding bars,
  data points, regression lines, error bars, gradient legends, density distributions
  in the margins, and even pictures. The package builds further on R graphics by simply
  combining functions and settings in order to reduce the amount of code to produce
  for the user. As a result, the package does not use formula input or special syntax,
  but can be used in combination with default R plot functions. Note: Most of the
  functions were part of the package ''itsadug'', which is now split in two packages:
  1. the package ''itsadug'', which contains the core functions for visualizing and
  evaluating nonlinear regression models, and 2. the package ''plotfunctions'', which
  contains more general plot functions.'
