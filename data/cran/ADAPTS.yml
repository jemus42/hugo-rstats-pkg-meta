  Automated Deconvolution Augmentation of Profiles for Tissue
  Specific Cells
maintainer: Samuel A Danziger
description: |-
  Augments existing or de-novo cell-type signature matrices to deconvolve bulk gene expression data.
  Useful for building signature matrices from single cell RNAseq data, determine cell type deconvolution
  spillover, and hierarchical deconvolution to use spillover to increase deconvolution accuracy. Please cite:

  Tissue Specific cells <doi:10.1101/633958>. This package expands on the techniques outlined in Newman AM,
  Liu CL, Green MR, Gentles AJ, Feng W, Xu Y,
  Hoang CD, Diehn M, Alizadeh, AA (2015) <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3337>'s Nature Methods paper:
  'Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles'  to allow a user to easily add
  their own cell types (e.g. a tumor specific cell type) to Newman's LM22 or other signature matrix.
