title: Imprecise Imputation for Statistical Matching
maintainer: Paul Fink
description: |-
  Imputing blockwise missing data by imprecise imputation,
  featuring a domain-based, variable-wise, and case-wise strategy.
  Furthermore, the estimation of lower and upper bounds for
  unconditional and conditional probabilities based on the obtained
  imprecise data is implemented.
  Additionally, two utility functions are supplied: one to check
  whether variables in a data set contain set-valued observations;
  and another to merge two already imprecisely imputed data.
  The method is described in a technical report by Endres, Fink and
  Augustin (2018, <doi:10.5282/ubm/epub.42423>).
