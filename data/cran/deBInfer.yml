title: Bayesian Inference for Differential Equations
maintainer: Philipp H Boersch-Supan
description: |-
  A Bayesian framework for parameter inference in differential equations.
  This approach offers a rigorous methodology for parameter inference as well as
  modeling the link between unobservable model states and parameters, and
  observable quantities. Provides templates for the DE model, the
  observation model and data likelihood, and the model parameters and their prior
  distributions. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure processes these inputs
  to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters and any derived
  quantities, including the model trajectories. Further functionality is provided
  to facilitate MCMC diagnostics and the visualisation of the posterior distributions
  of model parameters and trajectories.
