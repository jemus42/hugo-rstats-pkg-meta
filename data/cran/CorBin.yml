  Generate High-Dimensional Binary Data with Correlation
  Structures
maintainer: Shuang Song
description: We design algorithms with linear time complexity with respect to the
  dimension for three commonly studied correlation structures, including exchangeable,
  decaying-product and K-dependent correlation structures, and extend the algorithms
  to generate binary data of general non-negative correlation matrices with quadratic
  time complexity. Jiang, W., Song, S.,  Hou, L. and Zhao, H. "A set of efficient
  methods to generate high-dimensional binary data with correlation structures." Submitted.
