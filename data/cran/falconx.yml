  Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Whole-Exome Sequencing
  Data
maintainer: Hao Chen
description: 'This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number profiling for whole-Exome
  sequencing data.  Given the allele-specific coverage and site biases at the variant
  loci, this program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific
  copy number.  It requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in
  a pair of case and control samples, as well as the site biases. For detection of
  somatic mutations, the case and control samples can be the tumor and normal sample
  from the same individual.  The implemented method is based on the paper: Chen, H.,
  Jiang, Y., Maxwell, K., Nathanson, K. and Zhang, N. (under review). Allele-specific
  copy number estimation by whole Exome sequencing.'
