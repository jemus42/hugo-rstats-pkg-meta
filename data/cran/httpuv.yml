version: 1.5.2
title: HTTP and WebSocket Server Library
maintainer: Joe Cheng
description: |-
  Provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling
  HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily
  intended as a building block for other packages, rather than making it
  particularly easy to create complete web applications using httpuv alone.
  httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of
  which were developed by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and
  http-parser license information.)
