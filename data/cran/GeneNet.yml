maintainer: Korbinian Strimmer
description: |-
  Analyzes gene expression
  (time series) data with focus on the inference of gene networks.
  In particular, GeneNet implements the methods of Schaefer and
  Strimmer (2005a,b,c) and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2006, 2007)
  for learning large-scale gene association networks (including
  assignment of putative directions).
