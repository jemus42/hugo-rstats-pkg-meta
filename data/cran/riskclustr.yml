title: Functions to Study Etiologic Heterogeneity
maintainer: Emily C. Zabor
description: 'A collection of functions related to the study of etiologic heterogeneity
  both across disease subtypes and across individual disease markers. The included
  functions allow one to quantify the extent of etiologic heterogeneity in the context
  of a case-control study, and provide p-values to test for etiologic heterogeneity
  across individual risk factors. Begg CB, Zabor EC, Bernstein JL, Bernstein L, Press
  MF, Seshan VE (2013) <doi: 10.1002/sim.5902>.'
