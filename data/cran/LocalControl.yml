  Nonparametric Methods for Generating High Quality Comparative
  Effectiveness Evidence
maintainer: Christophe G. Lambert
description: |-
  Implements novel nonparametric approaches to address
  biases and confounding when comparing treatments or exposures in
  observational studies of outcomes. While designed and appropriate for use
  in studies involving medicine and the life sciences, the package can be
  used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders.
  The package implements a family of methods for non-parametric bias correction
  when comparing treatments in observational studies, including survival
  analysis settings, where competing risks and/or censoring may be present.
  The approach extends to bias-corrected personalized predictions of treatment
  outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment effect-sizes
  across patient subgroups.
