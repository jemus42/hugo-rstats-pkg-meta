title: Weighted Descriptive Statistics
maintainer: Abbas Parchami
description: Weighted descriptive statistics is the discipline of quantitatively describing
  the main features of real-valued fuzzy data which usually given from a fuzzy population.
  One can summarize this special kind of fuzzy data numerically or graphically using
  this package. To interpret some of the properties of one or several sets of real-valued
  fuzzy data, numerically summarize is possible by some weighted statistics which
  are designed in this package such as mean, variance, covariance and correlation
  coefficent. Also, graphically interpretation can be given by weighted histogram
  and weighted scatter plot using this package to describe properties of real-valued
  fuzzy data set.
