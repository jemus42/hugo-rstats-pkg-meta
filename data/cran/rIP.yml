  Detects Fraud in Online Surveys by Tracing, Scoring, and
  Visualizing IP Addresses
maintainer: Ryan Kennedy
description: |-
  Takes an array of IPs and the keys for the services the user wishes to use (IP Hub, IP Intel, and Proxycheck),
  and passes these to all respective APIs. Returns a dataframe with the IP addresses (used for merging),
  country, ISP, labels for non-US IP Addresses, VPS use, and recommendations for blocking. The package
  also provides optional visualization tools for checking the distributions. Additional
  functions are provided to call each discrete API endpoint. The package and methods are detailed in the recent paper
  Waggoner, Kennedy, and Clifford (2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01285>.
