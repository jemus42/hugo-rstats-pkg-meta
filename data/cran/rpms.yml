title: Recursive Partitioning for Modeling Survey Data
maintainer: Daniell Toth
description: |-
  Functions to allow users to build and analyze design consistent
  tree and random forest models using survey data from a complex sample
  design.  The algorithm can fit a linear model to survey data in each
  node obtained by recursively partitioning the data.  The splitting
  variables and selected splits are obtained using a randomized permutation
  test procedure which adjusted for complex sample design features used to
  obtain the data. Likewise the model fitting algorithm produces
  design-consistent coefficients to any specified least squares linear model
  between the dependent and independent variables used in the end nodes.
  The main functions return the resulting binary tree or random forest as
  an object of "rpms" or "rpms_forest" type. The package also provides a number
  of functions and methods available for use with these object types.
