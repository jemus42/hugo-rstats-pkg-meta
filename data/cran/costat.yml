title: Time Series Costationarity Determination
maintainer: Guy Nason
description: |-
  Contains functions that can determine whether a time series
  is second-order stationary or not (and hence evidence for
  locally stationarity). Given two non-stationary series (i.e.
  locally stationary series) this package can then discover
  time-varying linear combinations that are second-order stationary.
