title: Stepwise Variable Selection Procedures for Regression Analysis
maintainer: Fu-Chang Hu
description: |-
  The stepwise variable selection procedure (with iterations
  between the 'forward' and 'backward' steps) can be used to obtain
  the best candidate final regression model in regression analysis.
  All the relevant covariates are put on the 'variable list' to be
  selected. The significance levels for entry (SLE) and for stay
  (SLS) are usually set to 0.15 (or larger) for being conservative.
  Then, with the aid of substantive knowledge, the best candidate
  final regression model is identified manually by dropping the
  covariates with p value > 0.05 one at a time until all regression
  coefficients are significantly different from 0 at the chosen alpha
  level of 0.05.
