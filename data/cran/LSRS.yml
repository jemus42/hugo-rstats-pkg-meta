title: Land Surface Remote Sensing
maintainer: Mehdi Sarparast
description: |-
  Rapid satellite data streams in operational applications
  have clear benefits for monitoring land cover,
  especially when information can be delivered as fast as changing
  surface conditions. Over the past decade,
  remote sensing has become a key tool for monitoring and predicting
  environmental variables by using satellite data.
  This package presents the main applications in remote sensing for
  land surface monitoring and land cover mapping (soil, vegetation, water...).
