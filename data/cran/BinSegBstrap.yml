title: Piecewise Smooth Regression by Bootstrapped Binary Segmentation
maintainer: Pein Florian
description: Provides methods for piecewise smooth regression. A piecewise smooth
  signal is estimated by applying a bootstrapped test recursively (binary segmentation
  approach). Each bootstrapped test decides whether the underlying signal is smooth
  on the currently considered subsegment or contains at least one further change-point.
