title: Statistical Tolerance Intervals and Regions
maintainer: Derek S. Young
description: Statistical tolerance limits provide the limits between which we can
  expect to find a specified proportion of a sampled population with a given level
  of confidence.  This package provides functions for estimating tolerance limits
  (intervals) for various univariate distributions (binomial, Cauchy, discrete Pareto,
  exponential, two-parameter exponential, extreme value, hypergeometric, Laplace,
  logistic, negative binomial, negative hypergeometric, normal, Pareto, Poisson-Lindley,
  Poisson, uniform, and Zipf-Mandelbrot), Bayesian normal tolerance limits, multivariate
  normal tolerance regions, nonparametric tolerance intervals, tolerance bands for
  regression settings (linear regression, nonlinear regression, nonparametric regression,
  and multivariate regression), and analysis of variance tolerance intervals.  Visualizations
  are also available for most of these settings.
