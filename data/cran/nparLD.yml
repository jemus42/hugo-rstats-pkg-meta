  Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial
  Experiments
maintainer: Kimihiro Noguchi
description: |-
  The package "nparLD" is designed to perform nonparametric
  analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments.
  Longitudinal data are those which are collected from the same
  subjects over time, and they frequently arise in biological
  sciences. Nonparametric methods do not require distributional
  assumptions, and are applicable to a variety of data types
  (continuous, discrete, purely ordinal, and dichotomous).  Such
  methods are also robust with respect to outliers and for small
  sample sizes.
