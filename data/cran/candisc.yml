  Correlation Analysis

  Functions for computing and visualizing
  generalized canonical discriminant analyses and canonical correlation analysis
  for a multivariate linear model.
  Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way 'MANOVA'
  design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
  response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
  The 'candisc' package generalizes this to higher-way 'MANOVA' designs
  for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
  computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D)
  visualizations of terms in an 'mlm' via the 'plot.candisc' and 'heplot.candisc' methods. Related plots are
  now provided for canonical correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
