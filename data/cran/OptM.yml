title: Estimating the Optimal Number of Migration Edges from 'Treemix'
maintainer: Robert Fitak
description: |-
  The popular population genetic software 'Treemix' by
  'Pickrell and Pritchard' (2012) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002967>
  estimates the number of migration edges on a population tree.
  However, it can be difficult to determine the number of migration
  edges to include. Previously, it was customary to stop adding migration
  edges when 99.8% of variation in the data was explained, but 'OptM'
  automates this process using an ad hoc statistic based on the
  second-order rate of change in the log likelihood.  'OptM' also
  has added functionality for various threshold modeling
  to compare with the ad hoc statistic.
