version: 2.1.0
title: Evolutionary Computation in R
maintainer: Jakob Bossek
description: Framework for building evolutionary algorithms for both single- and multi-objective
  continuous or discrete optimization problems. A set of predefined evolutionary building
  blocks and operators is included. Moreover, the user can easily set up custom objective
  functions, operators, building blocks and representations sticking to few conventions.
  The package allows both a black-box approach for standard tasks (plug-and-play style)
  and a much more flexible white-box approach where the evolutionary cycle is written
  by hand.
