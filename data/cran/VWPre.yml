title: Tools for Preprocessing Visual World Data
maintainer: Vincent Porretta
description: |-
  Gaze data from the Visual World Paradigm requires significant
  preprocessing prior to plotting and analyzing the data. This package
  provides functions for preparing visual world eye-tracking data for
  statistical analysis and plotting. It can prepare data for linear
  analyses (e.g., ANOVA, Gaussian-family LMER, Gaussian-family GAMM) as
  well as logistic analyses (e.g., binomial-family LMER and binomial-family GAMM).
  Additionally, it contains various plotting functions for creating grand average and
  conditional average plots. See the vignette for samples of the functionality.
  Currently, the functions in this package are designed for handling data
  collected with SR Research Eyelink eye trackers using Sample Reports created
  in SR Research Data Viewer.  While we would like to add functionality
  for data collected with other systems in the future, the current package is
  considered to be feature-complete; further updates will mainly entail maintenance
  and the addition of minor functionality.
