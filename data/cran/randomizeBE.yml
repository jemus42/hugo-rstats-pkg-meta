title: Create a Random List for Crossover Studies
maintainer: D. Labes
description: |-
  Contains a function to randomize subjects, patients in groups of
  sequences (treatment sequences).
  If a blocksize is given, the randomization will be done within blocks.
  The randomization may be controlled by a Wald-Wolfowitz runs test.
  Functions to obtain the p-value of that test are included.
  The package is mainly intended for randomization of bioequivalence studies
  but may be used also for other clinical crossover studies.
  Contains two helper functions sequences() and williams() to get the sequences
  of commonly used designs in BE studies.
