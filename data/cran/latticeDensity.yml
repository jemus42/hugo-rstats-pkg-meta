  Density Estimation and Nonparametric Regression on Irregular
  Regions
maintainer: Ronald Barry
description: |-
  Functions that compute the
  lattice-based density estimator of Barry and McIntyre, which
  accounts for point processes in two-dimensional regions with
  irregular boundaries and holes.  The package also implements
  two-dimensional non-parametric regression for similar regions.
