maintainer: Javaria Ahmad Khan
description: A collection of functions related to density estimation by using Chen's
  (2000) idea. Mean Squared Errors (MSE) are calculated for estimated curves. For
  this purpose, R functions allow the distribution to be Gamma, Exponential or Weibull.
  For details see Chen (2000), Scaillet (2004) <doi:10.1080/10485250310001624819>
