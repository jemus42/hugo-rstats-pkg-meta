  A Collection of functions for similarity analysis of vegetation
  data
maintainer: Gerald Jurasinski
description: |-
  Besides functions for the calculation of similarity and
  multiple plot similarity measures with binary data (for
  instance presence/absence species data) the package contains
  some simple wrapper functions for reshaping species lists into
  matrices and vice versa and some other functions for further
  processing of similarity data (Mantel-like permutation
  procedures) as well as some other useful stuff for vegetation
  analysis.
