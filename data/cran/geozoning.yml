title: Zoning Methods for Spatial Data
maintainer: HazaÃ«l Jones
description: |-
  A zoning method and a numerical criterion for zoning quality are available in this package.
  The zoning method is based on a numerical criterion that evaluates the zoning quality.
  This criterion quantifies simultaneously how zones are heterogeneous on
  the whole map and how neighbouring zones are similar. This approach allows comparison
  between maps either with different zones or different labels, which is of importance
  for zone delineation algorithms aiming at maximizing inter-zone variability. An optimisation
  procedure provides the user with the best zonings thanks to contour delineation for a given map.
