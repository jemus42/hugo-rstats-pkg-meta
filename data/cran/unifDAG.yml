maintainer: Markus Kalisch
description: |-
  Uniform sampling of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) using exact
  enumeration by relating each DAG to a sequence of outpoints (nodes with no
  incoming edges) and then to a composition of integers as suggested by
  Kuipers, J. and Moffa, G. (2015) <doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9428-y>.
