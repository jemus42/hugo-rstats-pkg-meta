version: 1.0.0
title: Process-Based Biogeographical Analysis
maintainer: Gabriel Caetano
description: Facilitates the incorporation of biological processes in biogeographical
  analyses. It offers conveniences in fitting, comparing and extrapolating models
  of biological processes such as physiology and phenology. These spatial extrapolations
  can be informative by themselves, but also complement traditional correlative species
  distribution models, by mixing environmental and process-based predictors.
