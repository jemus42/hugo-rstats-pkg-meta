  Regions with ChIP-Seq Data
maintainer: Vicky Qian Wu
description: 'Nonparametric Tests to identify the differential enrichment region for
  two conditions or time-course ChIP-seq data. It includes: data preprocessing function,
  estimation of a small constant used in hypothesis testing, a kernel-based two sample
  nonparametric test, two assumption-free  two sample nonparametric test.'
