title: Identification of the Factors Affecting Species Richness
maintainer: Cástor Guisande González
description: It identifies the factors significantly related to species richness,
  and their relative contribution, using multiple regressions and support vector machine
  models. It uses an output file of 'ModestR' (<http://www.ipez.es/ModestR>) with
  data of richness of the species and environmental variables in a cell size defined
  by the user. The residuals of the support vector machine model are shown on a map.
  Negative residuals may be potential areas with undiscovered and/or unregistered
  species, or areas with decreased species richness due to the negative effect of
  anthropogenic factors.
