title: Ensemble Correlation-Based Low-Rank Matrix Completion
maintainer: Mahdi Ghadamyari
description: Ensemble correlation-based low-rank matrix completion method (ECLRMC)
  is an extension to the LRMC based methods. Traditionally, the LRMC based methods
  give identical importance to the whole data which results in emphasizing on the
  commonality of the data and overlooking the subtle but crucial differences. This
  method aims to overcome the equality assumption problem that exists in the current
  LRMS based methods. Ensemble correlation-based low-rank matrix completion (ECLRMC)
  takes consideration of the specific characteristic of each sample and performs LRMC
  on the set of samples with a strong correlation. It uses an ensemble learning method
  to improve the imputation performance. Since each sample is analyzed independently
  this method can be parallelized by distributing imputation across many computation
  units or GPU platforms. This package provides three different methods (LRMC, CLRMC
  and ECLRMC) for data imputation. There is also an NRMS function for evaluating the
  result. Chen, Xiaobo, et al (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2017.06.010>.
