title: Evaluation of Inequality Constrained Hypotheses Using GORICA
maintainer: Caspar J. van Lissa
description: |-
  Implements the generalized order-restricted information criterion
  approximation (GORICA) by Kuiper, Hoijtink, & Silvapulle (2012)
  <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2012.03.007>. The GORICA is an AIC-like information
  criterion that
  can be utilized to evaluate informative hypotheses specifying
  directional relationships between model parameters in terms of (in)equality
  constraints. The GORICA is applicable not only to
  normal  linear models, but also to generalized linear models (GLMs),
  generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and structural equation models
  (SEMs). In addition, the GORICA can be utilized in the context of
  contingency tables for which (in)equality constrained hypotheses do not
  necessarily contain linear restrictions on cell probabilities, but instead
  often contain non-linear restrictions on cell probabilities.
