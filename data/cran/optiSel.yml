title: Optimum Contribution Selection and Population Genetics
maintainer: Robin Wellmann
description: A framework for the optimization of breeding programs via optimum contribution
  selection and mate allocation. An easy to use set of function for computation of
  optimum contributions of selection candidates, and of the population genetic parameters
  to be optimized. These parameters can be estimated using pedigree or genotype information,
  and include kinships, kinships at native haplotype segments, and breed composition
  of crossbred individuals. They are suitable for managing genetic diversity, removing
  introgressed genetic material, and accelerating genetic gain. Additionally, functions
  are provided for computing genetic contributions from ancestors, inbreeding coefficients,
  the native effective size, the native genome equivalent, pedigree completeness,
  and for preparing and plotting pedigrees.
