  Ecological and biogeographical null model tests for comparing
  rarefaction curves
maintainer: Luis Cayuela
description: Randomization tests for the statistical comparison of \emph{i} = two
  or more individual-based, sample-based or coverage-based rarefaction curves. The
  ecological null hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were all drawn randomly
  from a single assemblage, with (necessarily) a single underlying species abundance
  distribution. The biogeographic null hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were
  all drawn from different assemblages that, nonetheless, share similar species richness
  and species abundance distributions
