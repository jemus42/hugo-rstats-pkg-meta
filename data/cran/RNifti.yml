title: Fast R and C++ Access to NIfTI Images
maintainer: Jon Clayden
description: |-
  Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the
  NIfTI-1 and ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation between
  compiled C and interpreted R code. Also provides a simple image viewer, and
  a C/C++ API that can be used by other packages. Not to be confused with
  'RNiftyReg', which performs image registration.
