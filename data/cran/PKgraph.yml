  PKgraph provides a graphical user interface for population
  pharmacokinetic model diagnosis. It also provides an integrated
  and comprehensive platform for the analysis of pharmacokinetic
  data including exploratory data analysis, goodness of model
  fit, model validation and model comparison. Results from a
  variety of modeling fitting software, including NONMEM,
  Monolix, SAS and R, can be used. PKgraph is programmed in R,
