title: Generalized Quantitative Genetics Data Analyses
maintainer: Jixiang Wu
description: 'Two linear mixed model approaches: REML(restricted maximum likelihood)
  and MINQUE (minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation) approaches and several resampling
  techniques are integrated for various quantitative genetics analyses. With these
  two types of approaches, various unbalanced data structures, missing data, and any
  irregular genetic  mating designs can be analyzed and statistically tested. This
  package also offers fast computations for many large data sets.'
