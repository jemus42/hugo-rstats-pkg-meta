title: The Random Subgraph Model
maintainer: Pierre Latouche
description: Estimate the parameters, the number of classes and cluster vertices of
  a random network into groups with homogeneous connection profiles. The clustering
  is performed for directed graphs with typed edges (edges are assumed to be drawn
  from multinomial distributions) for which a partition of the vertices is available.
