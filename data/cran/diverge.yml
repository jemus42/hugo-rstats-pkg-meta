  Evolutionary Trait Divergence Between Sister Species and Other
  Paired Lineages
maintainer: Sean A. S. Anderson
description: Compares the fit of alternative models of continuous trait differentiation
  between sister species and other paired lineages. Differences in trait means between
  two lineages arise as they diverge from a common ancestor, and alternative processes
  of evolutionary divergence are expected to leave unique signatures in the distribution
  of trait differentiation in datasets comprised of many lineage pairs. Models include
  approximations of divergent selection, drift, and stabilizing selection. A variety
  of model extensions facilitate the testing of process-to-pattern hypotheses. Users
  supply trait data and divergence times for each lineage pair. The fit of alternative
  models is compared in a likelihood framework.
