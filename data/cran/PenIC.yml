  Semiparametric Regression Analysis of Interval-Censored Data
  using Penalized Splines
maintainer: Yan Liu
description: |-
  Currently incorporate the generalized odds-rate model (a type of linear
  transformation model) for interval-censored data based on penalized monotonic B-Spline.
  More methods under other semiparametric models such as cure model or additive model will
  be included in future versions. For more details see Lu, M., Liu, Y., Li, C. and Sun, J.
