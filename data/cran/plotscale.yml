title: Scale Graphics Devices Using Plot Dimensions
maintainer: Tim Bergsma
description: |-
  Figures rendered on graphics devices are usually
  rescaled to fit pre-determined device dimensions. 'plotscale'
  implements the reverse: desired plot dimensions are specified
  and device dimensions are calculated to accommodate marginal
  material, giving consistent proportions for plot elements.
  Default methods support grid graphics such as lattice and ggplot.
  See "example('devsize')" and "vignette('plotscale')".
