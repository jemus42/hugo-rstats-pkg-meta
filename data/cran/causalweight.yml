  Probability Weighting
maintainer: Hugo Bodory
description: Various estimation methods for causal inference based on inverse probability
  weighting. Specifically, the package includes methods for estimating average treatment
  effects as well as direct and indirect effects in causal mediation analysis. The
  models refer to the studies of Froelich (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2006.06.004>,
  Huber (2012) <doi:10.3102/1076998611411917>, Huber (2014) <doi:10.1080/07474938.2013.806197>,
  Huber (2014) <doi:10.1002/jae.2341>, and Froelich and Huber (2017) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12232>.
