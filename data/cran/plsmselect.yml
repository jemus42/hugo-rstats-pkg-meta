  Linear and Smooth Predictor Modelling with Penalisation and
  Variable Selection
maintainer: Indrayudh Ghosal
description: |-
  Fit a model with potentially many linear and smooth predictors. Interaction
  effects can also be quantified. Variable selection is done using penalisation. For l1-type penalties
  we use iterative steps alternating between using linear predictors (lasso) and smooth predictors
  (generalised additive model).
