title: Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant Tests of Equivalence
maintainer: Thoralf Mildenberger
description: |-
  Implementation of uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence
  tests for one- and two-sample problems (paired and unpaired) as described
  in Wellek (2010, ISBN:978-1-4398-0818-4). Also one-sided alternatives
  (non-inferiority and non-superiority tests) are supported. Basically a variant
  of a t-test with (relaxed) null and alternative hypotheses exchanged.
