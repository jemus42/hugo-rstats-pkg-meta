title: Rmetrics - Nonlinear and Chaotic Time Series Modelling
maintainer: Tobias Setz
description: |-
  Provides a collection of functions for testing various aspects of
  univariate time series including independence and neglected
  nonlinearities. Further provides functions to investigate the chaotic
  behavior of time series processes and to simulate different types of chaotic
  time series maps.
