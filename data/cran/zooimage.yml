title: Analysis of Numerical Plankton Images
maintainer: Philippe Grosjean
description: |-
  A free (open source) solution for analyzing digital
  images of plankton. In combination with ImageJ, a free image analysis
  system, it processes digital images, measures individuals, trains for
  automatic classification of taxa, and finally, measures plankton samples
  (abundances, total and partial size spectra or biomasses, etc.).
