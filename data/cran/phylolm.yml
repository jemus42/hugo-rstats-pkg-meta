title: Phylogenetic Linear Regression
maintainer: Lam Si Tung Ho
description: Provides functions for fitting phylogenetic linear models and phylogenetic
  generalized linear models. The computation uses an algorithm that is linear in the
  number of tips in the tree. The package also provides functions for simulating continuous
  or binary traits along the tree. Other tools include functions to test the adequacy
  of a population tree.
