  Degrees of Freedom of Elastic Net, Adaptive Lasso and
  Generalized Elastic Net
maintainer: Kei Hirose
description: |-
  Computes the degrees of freedom of the lasso,
  elastic net, generalized elastic net and adaptive lasso based
  on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The optimal model
  can be selected by model selection criteria including Mallows'
  Cp, bias-corrected AIC (AICc), generalized cross validation
  (GCV) and BIC.
