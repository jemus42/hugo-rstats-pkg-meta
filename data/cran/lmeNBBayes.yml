  Compute the Personalized Activity Index Based on a Flexible
  Bayesian Negative Binomial Model
maintainer: Yumi Kondo
description: The functions in this package implement the safety monitoring procedures
  proposed in the paper titled "A flexible mixed effect negative binomial regression
  model for detecting unusual increases in MRI lesion counts in individual multiple
  sclerosis patients" by Kondo, Y., Zhao, Y. and Petkau, A.J. The procedure first
  models longitudinally collected count variables with a negative binomial mixed-effect
  regression model. To account for the correlation among repeated measures from the
  same patient, the model has subject-specific random intercept, which is modelled
  with the infinite mixture of Beta distributions, very flexible distribution that
  theoretically allows any form. The package also has the option of a single beta
  distribution for random effects. These mixed-effect models could be useful beyond
  the application of the safety monitoring. The inference is based on MCMC samples
  and this package contains a Gibbs sampler to sample from the posterior distribution
  of the negative binomial mixed-effect regression model. Based on the fitted model,
  the personalized activity index is computed for each patient. Lastly, this package
  is companion to R package lmeNB, which contains the functions to compute the Personalized
  Activity Index in the frequentist framework.
