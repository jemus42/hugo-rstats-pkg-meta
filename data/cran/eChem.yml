title: Simulations for Electrochemistry Experiments
maintainer: David Harvey
description: |-
  Simulates cyclic voltammetry, linear-sweep voltammetry
  (both with and without stirring of the solution), and single-pulse
  and double-pulse chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry
  experiments using the implicit finite difference method outlined in
  Gosser (1993, ISBN: 9781560810261) and in Brown (2015)
  <doi:10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225>. Additional functions provide
  ways to display and to examine the results of these simulations.
  The primary purpose of this package is to provide tools for
  use in courses in analytical chemistry.
