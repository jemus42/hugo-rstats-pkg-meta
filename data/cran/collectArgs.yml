  Quickly and Neatly Collect Arguments from One Environment to
  Pass to Another
maintainer: Rick Saporta
description: |-
  We often want to take all (or most) of the objects in one environment (such as the parameter values of a function) and pass them to another. This might be calling a second function, or iterating over a list, calling the same function. These functions wrap often repeated code.
  Current stable version (committed on October 14, 2017).
