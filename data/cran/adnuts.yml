title: No-U-Turn MCMC Sampling for 'ADMB' and 'TMB' Models
maintainer: Cole Monnahan
description: |-
  Bayesian inference using the no-U-turn (NUTS) algorithm by
  Hoffman and Gelman (2014) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/hoffman14a.html>.
  Designed for 'AD Model Builder' ('ADMB') models,
  or when R functions for log-density and log-density gradient
  are available, such as 'Template Model Builder' ('TMB')
  models and other special cases. Functionality is similar to 'Stan',
  and the 'rstan' and 'shinystan' packages are used for diagnostics and
  inference.
