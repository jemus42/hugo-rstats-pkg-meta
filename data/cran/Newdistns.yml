description: 'Computes the probability density function, cumulative distribution function,
  quantile function, random numbers and measures of inference for the following general
  families of  distributions (each family defined in terms of an arbitrary cdf G):
  Marshall Olkin G distributions, exponentiated G distributions, beta G distributions,
  gamma G distributions, Kumaraswamy G distributions, generalized beta G distributions,
  beta extended G distributions, gamma G distributions, gamma uniform G distributions,
  beta exponential G distributions, Weibull G distributions, log gamma G I distributions,
  log gamma G II distributions, exponentiated generalized G distributions, exponentiated
  Kumaraswamy G distributions, geometric exponential Poisson G distributions, truncated-exponential
  skew-symmetric G distributions, modified beta G distributions, and exponentiated
  exponential Poisson G distributions.'
