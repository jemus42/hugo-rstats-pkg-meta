title: Statistical Inference of C- And D-Vine Copulas
maintainer: Tobias Erhardt
description: |-
  Functions for statistical inference of canonical vine (C-vine)
  and D-vine copulas. Tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis and for bivariate
  as well as vine copula selection are provided. Models can be estimated
  either sequentially or by joint maximum likelihood estimation.
  Sampling algorithms and plotting methods are also included.
  Data is assumed to lie in the unit hypercube (so-called copula
  data).
