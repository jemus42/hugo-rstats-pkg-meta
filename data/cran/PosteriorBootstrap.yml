title: Non-Parametric Sampling with Parallel Monte Carlo
maintainer: James Robinson
description: |-
  An implementation of a non-parametric statistical model using a
  parallelised Monte Carlo sampling scheme. The method implemented in this
  package allows non-parametric inference to be regularized for small sample
  sizes, while also being more accurate than approximations such as
  variational Bayes. The concentration parameter is an effective sample size
  parameter, determining the faith we have in the model versus the data. When
  the concentration is low, the samples are close to the exact Bayesian
  logistic regression method; when the concentration is high, the samples are
  close to the simplified variational Bayes logistic regression. The method is
  described in full in the paper Lyddon, Walker, and Holmes (2018),
  "Nonparametric learning from Bayesian models with randomized objective
  functions" <arXiv:1806.11544>.
