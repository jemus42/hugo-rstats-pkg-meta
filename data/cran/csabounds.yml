title: Bounds on Distributional Treatment Effect Parameters
maintainer: Brantly Callaway
description: The joint distribution of potential outcomes is not typically identified
  under standard identifying assumptions such as selection on observables or even
  when individuals are randomly assigned to being treated. This package contains methods
  for obtaining tight bounds on distributional treatment effect parameters when panel
  data is available and under a Copula Stability Assumption as in Callaway (2017)
