title: Tools for Manipulating and Summarizing CMIP5 Data
maintainer: Kathe Todd-Brown
description: |-
  Working with CMIP5 data can be tricky, forcing scientists to write
  custom scripts and programs. The `RCMIP5` package aims to ease this
  process, providing a standard, robust, and high-performance set of scripts
  to (i) explore what data have been downloaded, (ii) identify missing data,
  (iii) average (or apply other mathematical operations) across experimental
  ensembles, (iv) produce both temporal and spatial statistical summaries,
  and (v) produce easy-to-work-with graphical and data summaries.
