title: Generate a Random p x p Correlation Matrix
maintainer: Daniel F. Schmidt
description: Implements the algorithm by Pourahmadi and Wang (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.spl.2015.06.015>
  for generating a random p x p correlation matrix. Briefly, the idea is to represent
  the correlation matrix using Cholesky factorization and p(p-1)/2 hyperspherical
  coordinates (i.e., angles), sample the angles from a particular distribution and
  then convert to the standard correlation matrix form. The angles are sampled from
  a distribution with pdf proportional to sin^k(theta) (0 < theta < pi, k >= 1) using
  the efficient sampling algorithm described in Enes Makalic and Daniel F. Schmidt
  (2018) <arXiv:1809.05212>.
