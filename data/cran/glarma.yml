title: Generalized Linear Autoregressive Moving Average Models
maintainer: '"William T.M. Dunsmuir"'
description: Functions are provided for estimation, testing, diagnostic checking and
  forecasting of generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) models
  for discrete valued time series with regression variables.  These are a class of
  observation driven non-linear non-Gaussian state space models. The state vector
  consists of a linear regression component plus an observation driven component consisting
  of an autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) filter of past predictive residuals.
  Currently three distributions (Poisson, negative binomial and binomial) can be used
  for the response series. Three options (Pearson, score-type and unscaled) for the
  residuals in the observation driven component are available. Estimation is via maximum
  likelihood (conditional on initializing values for the ARMA process) optimized using
  Fisher scoring or Newton Raphson iterative methods. Likelihood ratio and Wald tests
  for the observation driven component allow testing for serial dependence in generalized
  linear model settings. Graphical diagnostics including model fits, autocorrelation
  functions and probability integral transform residuals are included in the package.
  Several standard data sets are included in the package.
