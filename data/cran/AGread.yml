title: Read Data Files from ActiGraph Monitors
maintainer: Paul R. Hibbing
description: |-
  Standardize the process of bringing various modes of output files
  into R. Additionally, processes are provided to read and minimally pre-
  process raw data from primary accelerometer and inertial measurement unit files,
  as well as binary .gt3x files. ActiGraph monitors are used to estimate physical
  activity outcomes via body-worn sensors that measure (e.g.) acceleration or
  rotational velocity.
