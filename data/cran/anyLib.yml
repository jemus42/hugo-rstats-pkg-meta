title: Install and Load Any Package from CRAN, Bioconductor or Github
maintainer: Aurelien Chateigner
description: |-
  Made to make your life simpler with packages, by
  installing and loading a list of packages, whether they are on CRAN,
  Bioconductor or github. For github, if you do not have the full path, with
  the maintainer name in it (e.g. "achateigner/topReviGO"), it will be able to
  load it but not to install it.
