  Finding Multiple-Objective Optimal Designs for the 4-Parameter
  Logistic Model
maintainer: Yarong Yang
description: |-
  Provide tools for finding multiple-objective optimal designs for
  estimating the shape of dose-response, the ED50 (the dose producing an effect
  midway between the expected responses at the extreme doses) and the MED (the
  minimum effective dose level) for the 2,3,4-parameter logistic models and for
  evaluating its efficiencies for the three objectives. The acronym VNM stands
  for V-algorithm using Newton Raphson method to search multiple-objective
  optimal design.
