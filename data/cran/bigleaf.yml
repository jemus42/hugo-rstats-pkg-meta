  Physical and Physiological Ecosystem Properties from Eddy
  Covariance Data

description: |-
  Calculation of physical (e.g. aerodynamic conductance, surface temperature),
  and physiological (e.g. canopy conductance, water-use efficiency) ecosystem properties
  from eddy covariance data and accompanying meteorological measurements. Calculations
  assume the land surface to behave like a 'big-leaf' and return bulk ecosystem/canopy variables.
