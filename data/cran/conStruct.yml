description: |-
  A method for modeling genetic data as a combination of discrete
  layers, within each of which relatedness may decay continuously with geographic
  distance. This package contains code for running analyses (which are implemented
  in the modeling language 'rstan') and visualizing and interpreting output. See the
  paper for more details on the model and its utility.
