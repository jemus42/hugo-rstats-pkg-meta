  Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball
  Statistics
maintainer: Jin Zhu
description: Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening (SIS) procedure based
  on ball statistics, including ball divergence <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1579>, ball covariance
  <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1543600>, and ball correlation <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1462709>,
  are developed to analyze complex data in metric spaces, e.g, shape, directional,
  compositional and symmetric positive definite matrix data. The ball divergence and
  ball covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to detecting distribution
  difference and association in metric spaces <arXiv:1811.03750>. Furthermore, several
  generic non-parametric feature selection procedures based on ball correlation, BCor-SIS
  and all of its variants, are implemented to tackle the challenge in the context
  of ultra high dimensional data.
