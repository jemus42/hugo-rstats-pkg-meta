  Mixed Effects Modeling with Warping for Functional Data Using
  B-Spline
maintainer: Emilie Devijver
description: |-
  Mixed effects modeling with warping for functional data using B-
  spline. Warping coefficients are considered as random effects, and warping
  functions are general functions, parameters representing the projection onto B-
  spline basis of a part of the warping functions. Warped data are modelled by a
  linear mixed effect functional model, the noise is Gaussian and independent from
  the warping functions.
