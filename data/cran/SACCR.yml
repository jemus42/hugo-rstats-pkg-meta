title: SA Counterparty Credit Risk under Basel III
maintainer: Tasos Grivas
description: |-
  Computes the Exposure-At-Default based on standardized approach
  of the Basel III Regulatory framework (SA-CCR). Currently, trade types of all
  the five major asset classes have been created and, given the inheritance-
  based structure of the application, the addition of further trade types
  is straightforward. The application returns a list of trees (one per CSA) after
  automatically separating the trades based on the CSAs, the hedging sets, the
  netting sets and the risk factors. The basis and volatility transactions are
  also identified and treated in specific hedging sets whereby the corresponding
  penalty factors are applied. All the examples appearing on the
  regulatory paper (including the margined and the un-margined workflow) have been
  implemented including the latest FAQ enhancements.
