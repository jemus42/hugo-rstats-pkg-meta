title: '''HJ Biplot'' using Different Ways of Penalization'
maintainer: Mitzi Cubilla-Montilla
description: 'Contains a set of functions that allow to represent multivariate on
  a subspace of low dimension, in such a way that most of the variability of the information
  is captured. This representation is carried out through the ''HJ Biplot'' methodology.
  A first method performs the ''HJ Biplot''.Then, the package implements three new
  techniques and constructs in each case the ''HJ Biplot'', adapting restrictions
  to contract and / or produce zero charges in the main components, using three methods
  of regularization: Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net.'
