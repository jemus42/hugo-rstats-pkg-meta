title: Permutations of Multisets in Cool-Lex Order
maintainer: James Curran
description: A set of tools to permute multisets without loops or hash tables and
  to generate integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C code from
  Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to colexicographical order. The algorithm
  is described in Williams, A. Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations by Prefix
  Shifts. SODA 2009, Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New York, United States. The
  permutation code is distributed without restrictions. The code for stable and efficient
  computation of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be
  download from <http://tamivox.org/dave/multinomial/index.html> and is distributed
  without conditions. The package also generates the integer partitions of a positive,
  non-zero integer n. The C++ code for this is based on Python code from Jerome Kelleher
  which can be found here <http://jeromekelleher.net/category/combinatorics.html>.
  The C++ code and Python code are distributed without conditions.
