title: Group Factor Analysis
maintainer: Eemeli Lepp√§aho
description: Factor analysis implementation for multiple data sources, i.e., for groups
  of variables. The whole data analysis pipeline is provided, including functions
  and recommendations for data normalization and model definition, as well as missing
  value prediction and model visualization. The model group factor analysis (GFA)
  is inferred with Gibbs sampling, and it has been presented originally by Virtanen
  et al. (2012), and extended in Klami et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2376974>
  and Bunte et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw207>; for details, see the
  citation info.
