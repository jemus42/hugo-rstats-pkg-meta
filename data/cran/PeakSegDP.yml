  Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Peak Detection in ChIP-Seq
  Data
maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking
description: |-
  A quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm
  can be used to compute an approximate solution to the problem of
  finding the most likely changepoints
  with respect to the Poisson likelihood, subject
  to a constraint on the number of segments, and the changes which must
  alternate: up, down, up, down, etc. For more info read

  for peak detection in count data" by TD Hocking et al,
  proceedings of ICML2015.
