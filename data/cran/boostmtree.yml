title: Boosted Multivariate Trees for Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Udaya B. Kogalur
description: Implements Friedman's gradient descent boosting algorithm for modeling
  of continuous or binary longitudinal response using multivariate tree base learners.  A
  time-covariate interaction effect is modeled using penalized B-splines (P-splines)
  with estimated adaptive smoothing parameter.
