title: Image Processing Library Based on 'CImg'
maintainer: Shota Ochi
description: |-
  Fast image processing for images in up to 4 dimensions (two spatial
  dimensions, one time/depth dimension, one colour dimension). Provides most
  traditional image processing tools (filtering, morphology, transformations,
  etc.) as well as various functions for easily analysing image data using R. The
  package wraps 'CImg', <http://cimg.eu>, a simple, modern C++ library for image
  processing.
