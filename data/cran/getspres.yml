title: SPRE Statistics for Exploring Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis
maintainer: Lerato E Magosi
description: |-
  An implementation of SPRE (standardised predicted random-effects)
  statistics in R to explore heterogeneity in genetic association meta-
  analyses, as described by Magosi et al. (2019)
  <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz590>. SPRE statistics are precision
  weighted residuals that indicate the direction and extent with which
  individual study-effects in a meta-analysis deviate from the average
  genetic effect. Overly influential positive outliers have the potential
  to inflate average genetic effects in a meta-analysis whilst negative
  outliers might lower or change the direction of effect. See the 'getspres'
  website for documentation and examples
