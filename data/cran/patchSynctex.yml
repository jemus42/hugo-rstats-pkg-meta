title: Communication Between Editor and Viewer for Literate Programs
maintainer: Emmanuel Charpentier
description: |-
  This utility eases the debugging of literate documents
  ('noweb' files) by patching the synchronization information
  (the '.synctex(.gz)' file) produced by 'pdflatex' with
  concordance information produced by 'Sweave' or 'knitr' and
  'Sweave' or 'knitr' ; this allows for bilateral communication
  between a text editor (visualizing the 'noweb' source) and
  a viewer (visualizing the resultant 'PDF'), thus bypassing
  the intermediate 'TeX' file.
