maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Key-value store, implemented as a wrapper around 'LMDB';
  the "lightning memory-mapped database" <https://symas.com/lmdb/>.
  'LMDB' is a transactional key value store that uses a memory map
  for efficient access.  This package wraps the entire 'LMDB'
  interface (except duplicated keys), and provides objects for
  transactions and cursors.
