title: Spatially Explicit Structural Equation Modeling
maintainer: Eric Lamb
description: Structural equation modeling is a powerful statistical approach for the
  testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical causal relationships in complex
  data sets with inter-correlated dependent and independent variables. Here we implement
  a simple method for spatially explicit structural equation modeling based on the
  analysis of variance co-variance matrices calculated across a range of lag distances.
  This method provides readily interpreted plots of the change in path coefficients
  across scale.
