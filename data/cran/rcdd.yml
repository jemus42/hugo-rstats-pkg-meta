description: |-
  R interface to (some of) cddlib
  (<http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home/cdd.html>).
  Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex polytope:
  as solution of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as
  convex hull of set of points and rays.
  Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination
  (for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact
  infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
