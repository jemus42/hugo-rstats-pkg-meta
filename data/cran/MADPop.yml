title: MHC Allele-Based Differencing Between Populations
maintainer: Martin Lysy
description: |-
  Tools for the analysis of population differences
  using the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genotypes of samples
  having a variable number of alleles (1-4) recorded for each
  individual.  A hierarchical Dirichlet-Multinomial model on the
  genotype counts is used to pool small samples from multiple
  populations for pairwise tests of equality.  Bayesian inference is
  implemented via the 'rstan' package.  Bootstrapped and posterior
  p-values are provided for chi-squared and likelihood ratio tests of
  equal genotype probabilities.
