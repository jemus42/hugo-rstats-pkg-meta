title: A GTK GUI for teaching basic concepts in statistical inference,<U+000a>and
  doing elementary bayesian tests.
maintainer: Yvonnick Noel
description: 'A collection of statistical simulation and computation tools with a
  GTK GUI, to help teach statistical concepts and compute probabilities. Two domains
  are covered: I. Understanding (Central-Limit Theorem and the Normal Distribution,
  Distribution of a sample mean, Distribution of a sample variance, Probability calculator
  for common distributions), and II. Elementary Bayesian Statistics (bayesian inference
  on proportions, contingency tables, means and variances, with informative and noninformative
  priors).'
