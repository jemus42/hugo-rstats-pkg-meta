title: Binary Choice Models with Fixed Effects
maintainer: Amrei Stammann
description: |-
  Estimates fixed effects binary choice models (logit and probit) with potentially many
  individual fixed effects and computes average partial effects. Incidental parameter bias can be
  reduced with an asymptotic bias-correction proposed by Fernandez-Val (2009)
