title: Fitting Semi-Parametric Generalized log-Gamma Regression Models
maintainer: Carlos Alberto Cardozo Delgado
description: |-
  Set of tools to fit a linear multiple or semi-parametric regression
  models and non-informative right-censoring may be considered. Under this setup, the localization parameter of the response variable distribution is modeled by using linear multiple regression
  or semi-parametric functions, whose non-parametric components may be approximated
  by natural cubic spline or P-splines. The supported distribution for the model error is a generalized log-gamma distribution which includes
  the generalized extreme value distribution as important special case.
