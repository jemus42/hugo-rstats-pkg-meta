title: Variational Bayesian Inference for Genome-Wide Regression
maintainer: Akio Onogi
description: Conducts linear regression using variational Bayesian inference, particularly
  optimized for genome-wide association mapping and whole-genome prediction which
  use a number of DNA markers as the explanatory variables. Provides seven regression
  models which select the important variables (i.e., the variables related to response
  variables) among the given explanatory variables in different ways (i.e., model
  structures).
