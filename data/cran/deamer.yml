title: Deconvolution density estimation with adaptive methods for a<U+000a>variable
  prone to measurement error
maintainer: j.stirnemann
description: deamer provides deconvolution algorithms for the<U+000a>non-parametric
  estimation of the density f of an error-prone<U+000a>variable x with additive noise
  e. The model is y = x + e where<U+000a>the noisy variable y is observed, while x
  is unobserved.<U+000a>Estimation may be performed for i) a known density of the
  error<U+000a>ii) with an auxiliary sample of pure noise and iii) with an<U+000a>auxiliary
  sample of replicate (repeated) measurements.<U+000a>Estimation is performed using
  adaptive model selection and<U+000a>penalized contrasts.
