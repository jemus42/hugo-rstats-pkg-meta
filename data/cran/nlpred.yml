  Estimators of Non-Linear Cross-Validated Risks Optimized for
  Small Samples
maintainer: David Benkeser
description: Methods for obtaining improved estimates of non-linear cross-validated
  risks are obtained using targeted minimum loss-based estimation, estimating equations,
  and one-step estimation (Benkeser, Petersen, van der Laan (2019), <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1668794>).
  Cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (LeDell,
  Petersen, van der Laan (2015), <doi:10.1214/15-EJS1035>) and other metrics are included.
