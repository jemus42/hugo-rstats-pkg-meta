title: Hot Spots
maintainer: Anthony Darrouzet-Nardi
description: The hotspots package is designed to look within a set of measured values
  of a variable and identify values that are disproportionately high based on both
  the deviance of any given value from a statistical distribution and its similarity
  to other values. Because this relative magnitude of each value is taken into account,
  a value that is a statistical outlier may not always be a hot spot if other values
  are similarly large.
