title: Compare Groups, Analytically and Graphically
maintainer: Bill Pikounis
description: Comprehensive data analysis software, and the name "cg" stands for "compare
  groups." Its genesis and evolution are driven by common needs to compare administrations,
  conditions, etc. in medicine research and development. The current version provides
  comparisons of unpaired samples, i.e. a linear model with one factor of at least
  two levels. It also provides comparisons of two paired samples. Good data graphs,
  modern statistical methods, and useful displays of results are emphasized.
