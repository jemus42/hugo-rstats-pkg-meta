title: Exact permutation moments of quadratic form statistics
maintainer: Yi-Hui Zhou
description: This package gives you the exact first four permutation moments for the
  most commonly used quadratic form statistics, which need not be positive definite.
  The extension of this work to quadratic forms greatly expands the utility of density
  approximations for these problems, including for high-dimensional applications,
  where the statistics must be extreme in order to exceed stringent testing thresholds.
  Approximate p-values are obtained by matching the exact moments to the Pearson family
  of distributions using the PearsonDS package.
