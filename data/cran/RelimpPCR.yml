title: Relative Importance PCA Regression
maintainer: Michael Hernandez
description: 'Performs Principal Components Analysis (also known as PCA) dimensionality
  reduction in the context of a linear regression. In most cases, PCA dimensionality
  reduction is performed independent of the response variable for a regression. This
  captures the majority of the variance of the model''s predictors, but may not actually
  be the optimal dimensionality reduction solution for a regression against the response
  variable. An alternative method, optimized for a regression against the response
  variable, is to use both PCA and a relative importance measure. This package applies
  PCA to a given data frame of predictors, and then calculates the relative importance
  of each PCA factor against the response variable. It outputs ordered factors that
  are optimized for model fit. By performing dimensionality reduction with this method,
  an individual can achieve a the same r-squared value as performing just PCA, but
  with fewer PCA factors. References: Yuri Balasanov (2017) <https://ilykei.com>.'
