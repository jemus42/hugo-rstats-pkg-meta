title: Create Compact Hash Digests of R Objects
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation
  of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the 'md5', 'sha-1', 'sha-256',
  'crc32', 'xxhash', 'murmurhash' and 'spookyhash' algorithms) permitting easy
  comparison of R language objects, as well as functions such as'hmac()' to
  create hash-based message authentication code. Please note that this package
  is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic purposes for which more
  comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such as 'OpenSSL' should be
  used.
