  Statistical Models for the Unsupervised Segmentation of
  Time-Series ('SaMUraiS')
maintainer: Florian Lecocq
description: |-
  Provides a variety of original and flexible user-friendly
  statistical latent variable models and unsupervised learning algorithms to
  segment and represent time-series data (univariate or multivariate), and
  more generally, longitudinal data, which include regime changes.
  'samurais' is built upon the following packages, each of them is an
  autonomous time-series segmentation approach: Regression with Hidden
  Logistic Process ('RHLP'), Hidden Markov Model Regression ('HMMR'),
  Multivariate 'RHLP' ('MRHLP'), Multivariate 'HMMR' ('MHMMR'), Piece-Wise
  regression ('PWR'). For the advantages/differences of each of them, the
  user is referred to our mentioned paper references.
