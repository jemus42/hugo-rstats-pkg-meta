  Statistical Complexity and Information Measures for Time Series
  Analysis
maintainer: Sebastian Sippel
description: An implementation of local and global statistical complexity measures
  (aka Information Theory Quantifiers, ITQ) for time series analysis based on ordinal
  statistics (Bandt and Pompe (2002) <DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.174102>). Several
  distance measures that operate on ordinal pattern distributions, auxiliary functions
  for ordinal pattern analysis, and generating functions for stochastic and deterministic-chaotic
  processes for ITQ testing are provided.
