title: Tools for Working with XML Files as R Dataframes
maintainer: Joachim Zuckarelli
description: On import, the XML information is converted to a dataframe that reflects
  the hierarchical XML structure. Intuitive functions allow to navigate within this
  transparent XML data structure (without any knowledge of 'XPath'). 'flatXML' also
  provides tools to extract data from the XML into a flat dataframe that can be used
  to perform statistical operations.
