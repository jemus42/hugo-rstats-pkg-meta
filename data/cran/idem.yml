  Inference in Randomized Controlled Trials with Death and
  Missingness
maintainer: Chenguang Wang
description: |-
  In randomized studies involving severely ill patients, functional
  outcomes are often unobserved due to missed clinic visits, premature
  withdrawal or death. It is well known that if these unobserved functional
  outcomes are not handled properly, biased treatment comparisons can be
  produced. In this package, we implement a procedure for comparing treatments
  that is based on the composite endpoint of both the functional outcome and
  survival. The procedure was proposed in Wang et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12594>
  and Wang et al. (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v093.i12>. It considers missing data
  imputation with different sensitivity
  analysis strategies to handle the unobserved functional outcomes not due to
  death.
