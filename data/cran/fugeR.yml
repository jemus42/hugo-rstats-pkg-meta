  FUzzy GEnetic, a machine learning algorithm to construct
  prediction model based on fuzzy logic.
maintainer: Alexandre Bujard
description: |-
  This is an evolutionary algorithm for fuzzy systems, a
  genetic algorithm is used to construct a fuzzy system able to
  fit the given training data.  This fuzzy system can then be
  used as a prediction model, it's composed of fuzzy logic rules
  that provide a good lingustic representation.
