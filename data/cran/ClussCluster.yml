  Simultaneous Detection of Clusters and Cluster-Specific Genes in
  High-Throughput Transcriptome Data
maintainer: Li Jun
description: "Implements a new method 'ClussCluster' descried in Ge Jiang and Jun
  Li, \"Simultaneous Detection of Clusters and Cluster-Specific Genes in High-throughput
  Transcriptome Data\" (Unpublished).\nSimultaneously perform clustering analysis
  and signature \tgene selection on high-dimensional transcriptome data sets. \tTo
  do so, 'ClussCluster' incorporates a Lasso-type \tregularization penalty term to
  the objective function of K-\tmeans so that cell-type-specific signature genes can
  be \tidentified while clustering the cells."
