  Signal-Noise Separation in Random Matrices by using Eigenvalue
  Spectrum Analysis
maintainer: Uwe Menzel
description: An algorithm which can be used to determine an objective threshold for
  signal-noise separation in large random matrices (correlation matrices, mutual information
  matrices, network adjacency matrices) is provided. The package makes use of the
  results of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). The algorithm increments a suppositional
  threshold monotonically, thereby recording the eigenvalue spacing distribution of
  the matrix. According to RMT, that distribution undergoes a characteristic change
  when the threshold properly separates signal from noise. By using the algorithm,
  the modular structure of a matrix - or of the corresponding network - can be unraveled.
