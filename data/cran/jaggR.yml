title: |-
  Supporting Files and Functions for the Book Bayesian Modelling
  with 'JAGS'
maintainer: James Curran
description: |-
  All the data and functions used to produce the book. We do not expect
  most people to use the package for any other reason than to get simple access to the
  'JAGS' model files, the data, and perhaps run some of the simple examples.
  The authors of the book are David Lucy (now sadly deceased) and James Curran. It is
  anticipated that a manuscript will be provided to Taylor and Francis around February 2020, with
  bibliographic details to follow at that point. Until such time, further information
  can be obtained by emailing James Curran.
