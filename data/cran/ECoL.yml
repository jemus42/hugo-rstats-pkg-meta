title: Complexity Measures for Supervised Problems
maintainer: Luis Garcia
description: |-
  Provides measures to characterize the complexity of classification
  and regression problems based on aspects that quantify the linearity of the
  data, the presence of informative feature, the sparsity and dimensionality
  of the datasets. This package provides bug fixes, generalizations and
  implementations of many state of the art measures. The measures are
  described in the papers: Lorena et al. (2019) <doi:10.1145/3347711> and
  Lorena et al. (2018) <doi:10.1007/s10994-017-5681-1>.
