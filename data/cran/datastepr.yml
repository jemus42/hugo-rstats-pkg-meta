title: An Implementation of a SAS-Style Data Step
maintainer: Brandon Taylor
description: |-
  Based on a SAS data step. This allows for row-wise dynamic building
  of data, iteratively importing slices of existing dataframes, conducting
  analyses, and exporting to a results frame. This is particularly useful for
  differential or time-series analyses, which are often not well suited to vector-
  based operations.
