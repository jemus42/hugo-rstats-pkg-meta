title: Flexible Implementation of a Structural MCMC Sampler for DAGs
maintainer: Gilles Kratzer
description: 'Flexible implementation of a structural MCMC sampler for Directed Acyclic
  Graphs (DAGs). It supports the new edge reversal move from Grzegorczyk and Husmeier
  (2008) <doi:10.1007/s10994-008-5057-7> and the Markov blanket resampling from Su
  and Borsuk (2016) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v17/su16a.html>. It supports three priors:
  a prior controlling for structure complexity from Koivisto and Sood (2004) <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1005332.1005352>,
  an uninformative prior and a user-defined prior. The three main problems that can
  be addressed by this R package are selecting the most probable structure based on
  a cache of pre-computed scores, controlling for overfitting, and sampling the landscape
  of high scoring structures. It allows us to quantify the marginal impact of relationships
  of interest by marginalizing out over structures or nuisance dependencies. Structural
  MCMC seems an elegant and natural way to estimate the true marginal impact, so one
  can determine if it''s magnitude is big enough to consider as a worthwhile intervention.'
