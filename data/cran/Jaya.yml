maintainer: Neeraj Bokde
description: |-
  Maximization or Minimization of a fitness function using Jaya Algorithm (JA).
  A population based method which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.
  Capable of solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems.
  It does not contain any hyperparameters.
