title: Light Cone Reconstruction of States - Predictive State<U+000a>Estimation From
  Spatio-Temporal Data
maintainer: Georg M. Goerg
description: Estimates predictive states from spatio-temporal data and<U+000a>consequently
  can provide provably optimal forecasts.<U+000a>Currently this implementation<U+000a>supports
  an N-dimensional spatial grid observed over equally spaced time<U+000a>intervals.
  E.g. a video is a 2D spatial systems observed over time. This<U+000a>package implements
  mixed LICORS, has plotting tools (for (1+1)D and (2+1)D<U+000a>systems), and methods
  for optimal forecasting.  Due to memory limitations<U+000a>it is recommend to only
  analyze (1+1)D systems.
