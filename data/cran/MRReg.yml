title: MDL Multiresolution Linear Regression Framework
maintainer: Chainarong Amornbunchornvej
description: We provide the framework to analyze multiresolution partitions (e.g.
  country, provinces, subdistrict) where each individual data point belongs to only
  one partition in each layer (e.g. i belongs to subdistrict A, province P, and country
  Q).   We assume that a partition in a higher layer subsumes lower-layer partitions
  (e.g. a nation is at the 1st layer subsumes all provinces at the 2nd layer). Given
  N individuals that have a pair of real values (x,y) that generated from  independent
  variable X and dependent variable Y. Each individual i belongs to one partition
  per layer. Our goal is to find which partitions at which highest level that all
  individuals  in the these partitions share the same linear model Y=f(X) where f
  is a linear function. The framework deploys the Minimum Description Length principle
  (MDL) to infer solutions. The publication of this package is at Chainarong Amornbunchornvej,
