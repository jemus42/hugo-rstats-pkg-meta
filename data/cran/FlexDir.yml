title: Tools to Work with the Flexible Dirichlet Distribution
maintainer: Agnese Maria Di Brisco
description: |-
  Provides tools to work with the Flexible Dirichlet
  distribution. The main features are an E-M algorithm for computing the maximum
  likelihood estimate of the parameter vector and a function based on conditional
  bootstrap to estimate its asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. It contains
  also functions to plot graphs, to generate random observations and to handle
  compositional data.
