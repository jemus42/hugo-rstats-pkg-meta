title: Periodogram Peaks in Correlated Time Series
maintainer: Stilianos Louca
description: Calculates the periodogram of a time series, maximum-likelihood fits
  an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck state space (OUSS) null model and evaluates the statistical
  significance of periodogram peaks against the OUSS null hypothesis. The OUSS is
  a parsimonious model for stochastically fluctuating variables with linear stabilizing
  forces, subject to uncorrelated measurement errors. Contrary to the classical white
  noise null model for detecting cyclicity, the OUSS model can account for temporal
  correlations typically occurring in ecological and geological time series.
