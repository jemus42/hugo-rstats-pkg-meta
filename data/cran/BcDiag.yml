title: Diagnostics Plots for Bicluster Data
maintainer: Ewoud De Troyer
description: |-
  Diagnostic tools based on two-way
  anova and median-polish residual plots for Bicluster output
  obtained from packages; "biclust" by Kaiser et al.(2008),"isa2"
  by Csardi et al. (2010) and "fabia" by Hochreiter et al.
  (2010). Moreover, It provides visualization tools for bicluster
  output and corresponding non-bicluster rows- or columns
  outcomes.  It has also extended the idea of Kaiser et al.(2008)
  which is, extracting bicluster output in a text format, by
  adding two bicluster methods from the fabia and isa2 R
  packages.
