title: Nelson Rules for Control Charts
maintainer: Stanislav Matousek (MSD)
description: 'Implementation of Nelson rules for control charts in ''R''. The ''Rspc''
  implements some Statistical Process Control methods, namely Levey-Jennings type
  of I (individuals) chart, Shewhart C (count) chart and Nelson rules (as described
  in Montgomery, D. C. (2013) Introduction to statistical quality control. Hoboken,
  NJ: Wiley.). Typical workflow is taking the time series, specify the control limits,
  and list of Nelson rules you want to evaluate. There are several options how to
  modify the rules (one sided limits, numerical parameters of rules, etc.). Package
  is also capable of calculating the control limits from the data (so far only for
  i-chart and c-chart are implemented).'
