description: |-
  Colored terminal output on terminals that support 'ANSI'
  color and highlight codes. It also works in 'Emacs' 'ESS'. 'ANSI'
  color support is automatically detected. Colors and highlighting can
  be combined and nested. New styles can also be created easily.
  This package was inspired by the 'chalk' 'JavaScript' project.
