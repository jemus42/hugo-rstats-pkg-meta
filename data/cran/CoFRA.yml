title: Complete Functional Regulation Analysis
maintainer: Rune Matthiesen
description: |-
  Calculates complete functional regulation analysis and visualize
  the results in a single heatmap. The provided example data is for biological
  data but the methodology can be used for large data sets to compare quantitative
  entities that can be grouped. For example, a store might divide entities into
  cloth, food, car products etc and want to see how sales changes in the groups
  after some event. The theoretical background for the calculations are provided
  in New insights into functional regulation in MS-based drug profiling, Ana Sofia
  Carvalho, Henrik Molina & Rune Matthiesen, Scientific Reports <doi:10.1038/srep18826>.
