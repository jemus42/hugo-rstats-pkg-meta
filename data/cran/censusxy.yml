version: 0.1.2
title: Access the U.S. Census Bureau Geocoder
maintainer: Christopher Prener
description: |-
  Provides access to the U.S. Census Bureau's API for batch geocoding
  American street addresses (<https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder>).
  The package offers a batch solution for address geocoding, as opposed to geocoding
  a single address at a time. It has also been developed specifically with large
  data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding.
  If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset
  into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that
  a single object is returned.
