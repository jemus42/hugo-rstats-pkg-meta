  Identifies Mean, Variance, and Hierarchically Clustered
  Biclusters
maintainer: Erika S. Helgeson
description: 'Identifies a bicluster, a submatrix of the data such that the features
  and observations within the submatrix differ from those not contained in submatrix,
  using a two-step method. In the first step, observations in the bicluster are  identified
  to maximize the sum of weighted between cluster feature differences. The observations
  are identified in a similar fashion as in Witten and Tibshirani (2010) <doi:10.1198/jasa.2010.tm09415>
  except with a modified objective function and no feature sparsity constraint. In
  the second step, features in the bicluster are identified based on their contribution
  to the clustering of the observations. The cluster significance test of Liu, Hayes,
  Nobel, and Marron (2008): <doi:10.1198/016214508000000454> can then be used to test
  the strength of the identified bicluster. ''SCBiclust'' can be used to identify
  biclusters which differ based on feature means, feature variances, or more general
  differences.'
