title: Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology
maintainer: Dylan Beaudette
description: The Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project was started in
  2009 to organize a loosely-related set of concepts and source code on the topic
  of soil profile visualization, aggregation, and classification into this package
  (aqp). Over the past 8 years, the project has grown into a suite of related R packages
  that enhance and simplify the quantitative analysis of soil profile data. Central
  to the AQP project is a new vocabulary of specialized functions and data structures
  that can accommodate the inherent complexity of soil profile information; freeing
  the scientist to focus on ideas rather than boilerplate data processing tasks <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020>.
  These functions and data structures have been extensively tested and documented,
  applied to projects involving hundreds of thousands of soil profiles, and deeply
  integrated into widely used tools such as SoilWeb <https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soilweb-apps/>.
  Components of the AQP project (aqp, soilDB, sharpshootR, soilReports packages) serve
  an important role in routine data analysis within the USDA-NRCS Soil Science Division.
  The AQP suite of R packages offer a convenient platform for bridging the gap between
  pedometric theory and practice.
