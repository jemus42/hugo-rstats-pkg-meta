title: Tools for Case 2 Best-Worst Scaling
maintainer: Hideo Aizaki
description: Provides three basic functions that support an implementation of Case
  2 (profile case) best-worst scaling. The first is to convert an orthogonal main-effect
  design into questions, the second is to create a dataset suitable for analysis,
  and the third is to calculate count-based scores. For details, see Aizaki and Fogarty
  (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.jocm.2019.100171>.
