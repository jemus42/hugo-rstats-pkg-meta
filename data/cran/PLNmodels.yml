title: Poisson Lognormal Models
maintainer: Julien Chiquet
description: |-
  The Poisson-lognormal model and variants can be used for
  a variety of multivariate problems when count data are at play, including
  principal component analysis for count data (Chiquet, Mariadassou and Robin,
  2018 <doi:10.1214/18-AOAS1177>), discriminant analysis and
  network inference (Chiquet, Mariadassou and Robin, 2018 <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chiquet19a.html>).
  Implements variational algorithms to fit such models accompanied with a set of
  functions for visualization and diagnostic.
