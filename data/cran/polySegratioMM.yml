title: Bayesian Mixture Models for Marker Dosage in Autopolyploids
maintainer: Peter Baker
description: Fits Bayesian mixture models to estimate marker dosage for dominant markers
  in autopolyploids using JAGS (1.0 or greater) as outlined in Baker et al "Bayesian
  estimation of marker dosage in sugarcane and other autopolyploids" (2010, <doi:10.1007/s00122-010-1283-z>).
  May be used in conjunction with polySegratio for simulation studies and comparison
  with standard methods.
