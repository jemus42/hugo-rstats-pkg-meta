title: Estimation of CCI and CLFS Functions
maintainer: Eva Janousova
description: The currentSurvival package contains functions for the<U+000a>estimation
  of the current cumulative incidence (CCI) and the<U+000a>current leukaemia-free
  survival (CLFS). The CCI is the<U+000a>probability that a patient is alive and in
  any disease<U+000a>remission (e.g. complete cytogenetic remission in chronic<U+000a>myeloid
  leukaemia) after initiating his or her therapy (e.g.<U+000a>tyrosine kinase therapy
  for chronic myeloid leukaemia). The<U+000a>CLFS is the probability that a patient
  is alive and in any<U+000a>disease remission after achieving the first disease remission.
