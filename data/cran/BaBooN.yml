  Bayesian Bootstrap Predictive Mean Matching - Multiple and
  Single Imputation for Discrete Data
maintainer: Florian Meinfelder
description: |-
  Included are two variants of Bayesian Bootstrap
  Predictive Mean Matching to multiply impute missing data. The
  first variant is a variable-by-variable imputation combining
  sequential regression and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) that
  has been extended for unordered categorical data. The Bayesian
  Bootstrap allows for generating approximately proper multiple
  imputations. The second variant is also based on PMM, but the
  focus is on imputing several variables at the same time. The
  suggestion is to use this variant, if the missing-data pattern
  resembles a data fusion situation, or any other
  missing-by-design pattern, where several variables have
  identical missing-data patterns. Both variants can be run as
  'single imputation' versions, in case the analysis objective is
  of a purely descriptive nature.
