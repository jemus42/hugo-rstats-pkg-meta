title: Systems Insights from Generation of Hydroclimatic Timeseries
maintainer: Bree Bennett
description: A tool to create hydroclimate scenarios, stress test systems and visualize
  system performance in scenario-neutral climate change impact assessments. Scenario-neutral
  approaches 'stress-test' the performance of a modelled system by applying a wide
  range of plausible hydroclimate conditions (see Brown & Wilby (2012) <doi:10.1029/2012EO410001>
  and Prudhomme et al. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.06.043>). These approaches
  allow the identification of hydroclimatic variables that affect the vulnerability
  of a system to hydroclimate variation and change. This tool enables the generation
  of perturbed time series using a range of approaches including simple scaling of
  observed time series (e.g. Culley et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/2015WR018253>) and
  stochastic simulation of perturbed time series via an inverse approach (see Guo
  et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.025>). It incorporates a number of
  stochastic weather models to generate hydroclimate variables on a daily basis (e.g.
  precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration) and allows a variety of
  different hydroclimate variable properties, herein called attributes, to be perturbed.
  Options are included for the easy integration of existing system models both internally
  in R and externally for seamless 'stress-testing'. A suite of visualization options
  for the results of a scenario-neutral analysis (e.g. plotting performance spaces
  and overlaying climate projection information) are also included. As further developments
  in scenario-neutral approaches occur the tool will be updated to incorporate these
  advances.
