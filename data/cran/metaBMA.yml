  Bayesian Model Averaging for Random and Fixed Effects
  Meta-Analysis
maintainer: Daniel W. Heck
description: |-
  Computes the posterior model probabilities for standard meta-analysis models
  (null model vs. alternative model assuming either fixed- or random-effects, respectively).
  These posterior probabilities are used to estimate the overall mean effect size
  as the weighted average of the mean effect size estimates of the random- and
  fixed-effect model as proposed by Gronau, Van Erp, Heck, Cesario, Jonas, &
  Wagenmakers (2017, <doi:10.1080/23743603.2017.1326760>). The user can define
  a wide range of non-informative or informative priors for the mean effect size
  and the heterogeneity coefficient. Moreover, using pre-compiled Stan models,
  meta-analysis with continuous and discrete moderators with Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (JZS)
  priors can be fitted and tested. This allows to compute Bayes factors and
  perform Bayesian model averaging across random- and fixed-effects meta-analysis
  with and without moderators.
