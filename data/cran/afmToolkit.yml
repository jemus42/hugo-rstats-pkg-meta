  Functions for Atomic Force Microscope Force-Distance Curves
  Analysis
maintainer: Rafael Benitez
description: Set of functions for analyzing Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) force-distance
  curves. It allows to obtain the contact and unbinding points, perform the baseline
  correction, estimate the Young's modulus, fit up to two exponential decay function
  to a stress-relaxation / creep experiment, obtain adhesion energies. These operations
  can be done either over a single F-d curve or over a set of F-d curves in batch  mode.
