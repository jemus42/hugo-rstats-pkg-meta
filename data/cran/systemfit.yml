maintainer: Arne Henningsen
description: |-
  Econometric estimation of simultaneous
  systems of linear and nonlinear equations using Ordinary Least
  Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), Seemingly Unrelated
  Regressions (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), Weighted
  Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS), and Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS)
  as suggested, e.g., by Zellner (1962) <doi:10.2307/2281644>,
  Zellner and Theil (1962) <doi:10.2307/1911287>, and
  Schmidt (1990) <doi:10.1016/0304-4076(90)90127-F>.
