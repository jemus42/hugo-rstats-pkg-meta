title: Date Functions for Swedish Cancer Data
maintainer: Erik Bulow
description: Identify, convert and handle dates as used within the Swedish cancer
  register and associated cancer quality registers in Sweden. Especially the cancer
  register sometimes use nonstandard date variables where day and/or month can be
  "00" or were the date format is a mixture of"%Y-%m-%d", "%Y%m%d" and "%y%V" (two
  digit year and week number according to ISO 8601,which is not completely supported
  by R).These dates must be approximated to valid dates before being used in for example
  survival analysis. The package also includes some convenient functions for calculating
  "lead times" (relying on 'difftime') and introduce a "year" class with relevant
  S3-methods to handle yearly cohort.
