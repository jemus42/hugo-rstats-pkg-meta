title: Statistical Methods for the Randomized Response Technique
maintainer: Graeme Blair
description: |-
  Enables researchers to conduct multivariate statistical analyses
  of survey data with randomized response technique items from several designs,
  including mirrored question, forced question, and unrelated question. This
  includes regression with the randomized response as the outcome and logistic
  regression with the randomized response item as a predictor. In addition,
  tools for conducting power analysis for designing randomized response items
  are included. The package implements methods described in Blair, Imai, and Zhou
  (2015) ''Design and Analysis of the Randomized Response Technique,'' Journal
  of the American Statistical Association
