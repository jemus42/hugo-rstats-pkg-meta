title: Rapid Reconstruction of Time-Varying Gene Regulatory Networks
maintainer: Saptarshi Pyne
description: |-
  Rapid advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing
  technologies have resulted in genome-scale time-series datasets.
  Uncovering the underlying temporal sequence of gene regulatory events
  in the form of time-varying gene regulatory networks demands
  accurate and computationally efficient algorithms. Such an
  algorithm is 'TGS'. It is proposed in Saptarshi Pyne, Alok Ranjan
  Kumar, and Ashish Anand. Rapid reconstruction of time-varying
  gene regulatory networks. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational
  Biology and Bioinformatics, 17(1):278{291, Jan-Feb 2020. The TGS
  algorithm is shown to consume only 29 minutes for a microarray
  dataset with 4028 genes. This package provides an implementation
  of the TGS algorithm and its variants.
