  Package for Plotting Categorical Longitudinal and Time-Series
  Data
maintainer: Stephen Tueller
description: Methods for plotting categorical longitudinal and time-series data by
  mapping individuals to the vertical space (each horizontal line represents a participant),
  time (or repeated measures) to the horizontal space, categorical (or discrete) states
  as facets using color or shade, and events to points using plotting characters.
  Sorting individuals in the vertical space and (or) stratifying them by groups can
  reveal patterns in the changes over time.
