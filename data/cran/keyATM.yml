title: Keyword Assisted Topic Model
maintainer: Shusei Eshima
description: Fits keyword assisted topic models (keyATM) using collapsed Gibbs samplers.
  The keyATM combines the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) models with a small number
  of keywords selected by researchers in order to improve the interpretability and
  topic classification of the LDA. The keyATM can also incorporate covariates and
  directly model time trends. The keyATM is proposed in Eshima, Imai, and Sasaki (2020)
  <arXiv:2004.05964>.
