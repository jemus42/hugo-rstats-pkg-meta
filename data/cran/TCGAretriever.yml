description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a program aimed at improving our understanding
  of Cancer Biology. Several TCGA Datasets are available online. 'TCGAretriever' helps
  accessing and downloading TCGA data hosted on 'cBioPortal' via its Web Interface
  (see <http://www.cbioportal.org/> for more information). 'TCGAretriever' is easy
  to use (get all the TCGA data you need with a few lines of code), enforces reliable
  data download (via 'httr'), and is suitable for downloading large volumes of data.
