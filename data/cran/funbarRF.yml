  Fungal Species Identification using DNA Barcode with Random
  Forest
maintainer: Prabina Kumar Meher
description: A machine learning based approach for fungal species identification using
  barcode sequence data. The multi-class random forest model has been used for prediction
  purpose, where the gap-pair compositional feature was used to encode the barcode
  sequence data. The encoded dataset was used as input for prediction purpose. Though
  this approach has been developed for fungal species identification in particular,
  can be used for other species identification as well.
