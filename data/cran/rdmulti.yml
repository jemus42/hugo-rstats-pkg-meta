title: Analysis of RD Designs with Multiple Cutoffs or Scores
maintainer: Gonzalo Vazquez-Bare
description: 'The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental
  design for causal inference and policy evaluation. The ''rdmulti'' package provides
  tools to analyze RD designs with multiple cutoffs or scores: rdmc() estimates pooled
  and cutoff specific effects for multi-cutoff designs, rdmcplot() draws RD plots
  for multi-cutoff designs and rdms() estimates effects in cumulative cutoffs or multi-score
  designs. See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2020) <https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdmulti/Cattaneo-Titiunik-VazquezBare_2020_Stata.pdf>
  for further methodological details.'
