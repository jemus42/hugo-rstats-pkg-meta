title: R Port of the 'Scilab' Neldermead Module
maintainer: Sebastien Bihorel
description: |-
  Provides several direct search optimization algorithms based on the
  simplex method. The provided algorithms are direct search algorithms, i.e.
  algorithms which do not use the derivative of the cost function. They are
  based on the update of a simplex. The following algorithms are available: the
  fixed shape simplex method of Spendley, Hext and Himsworth (unconstrained
  optimization with a fixed shape simplex), the variable shape simplex method of
  Nelder and Mead (unconstrained optimization with a variable shape simplex
  made), and Box's complex method (constrained optimization with a variable
  shape simplex).
