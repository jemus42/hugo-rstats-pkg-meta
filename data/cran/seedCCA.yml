title: Seeded Canonical Correlation Analysis
maintainer: Jae Keun Yoo
description: Functions for dimension reduction through the seeded canonical correlation
  analysis are provided. A classical canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is one of
  useful statistical methods in multivariate data analysis, but it is limited in use
  due to the matrix inversion for large p small n data. To overcome this, a seeded
  CCA has been proposed in Im, Gang and Yoo (2015) <DOI:10.1002/cem.2691>. The seeded
  CCA is a two-step procedure. The sets of variables are initially reduced by successively
  projecting cov(X,Y) or cov(Y,X) onto cov(X) and cov(Y), respectively, without loss
  of information on canonical correlation analysis, following Cook, Li and Chiaromonte
  (2007) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asm038> and Lee and Yoo (2014) <DOI:10.1111/anzs.12057>.
  Then, the canonical correlation is finalized with the initially-reduced two sets
  of variables.
