  Easily and Rapidly Generate Raster Image Data with Support for
  'Plotly.js'
maintainer: Zehao Xu
description: Easily and rapidly generate raster data in R, even for very large datasets,
  with an aesthetics-based mapping syntax that should be familiar to users of the
  'ggplot2' package. While 'rasterly' does not attempt to reproduce the full functionality
  of the 'Datashader' graphics pipeline system for Python, the 'rasterly' API has
  several core elements in common with that software package.
