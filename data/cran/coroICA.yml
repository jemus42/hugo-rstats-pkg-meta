  Confounding Robust Independent Component Analysis for Noisy and
  Grouped Data
maintainer: Niklas Pfister
description: Contains an implementation of a confounding robust independent component
  analysis (ICA) for noisy and grouped data. The main function coroICA() performs
  a blind source separation, by maximizing an independence across sources and allows
  to adjust for varying confounding based on user-specified groups. Additionally,
  the package contains the function uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly
  diagonalize a list of matrices. For more details see the project website <https://sweichwald.de/coroICA/>.
