title: 'blockmatrix: Tools to solve algebraic systems with partitioned<U+000a>matrices'
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: Some elementary matrix algebra tools are implemented to manage<U+000a>block
  matrices or partitioned matrix, i.e. "matrix of matrices"<U+000a>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix).
  The block matrix is here<U+000a>defined as a new S3 object. In this package, some
  methods for "matrix"<U+000a>object are rewritten for "blockmatrix" object. New methods
  are implemented.<U+000a>This package was created to solve equation systems with
  block matrices for<U+000a>the analysis of environmental vector time series .<U+000a>Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration
  of any kind are warmly welcomed.
