  Estimate (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models with Factor
  Structures
maintainer: Nicholas Rockwood
description: |-
  Utilizes the 'lme4' and 'optimx' packages (previously the optim()
  function from 'stats') to estimate (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMM)
  with factor structures using a profile likelihood approach, as outlined in
  Jeon and Rabe-Hesketh (2012) <doi:10.3102/1076998611417628> and
  Rockwood and Jeon (2019) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1516541>.
  Factor analysis and item response models can be extended to allow
  for an arbitrary number of nested and crossed random effects,
  making it useful for multilevel and cross-classified models.
