title: Active Set and Generalized PAVA for Isotone Optimization
maintainer: Patrick Mair
description: |-
  Contains two main functions: one for
  solving general isotone regression problems using the
  pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA); another one provides
  a framework for active set methods for isotone optimization
  problems with arbitrary order restrictions. Various types of
  loss functions are prespecified.
