description: |-
  Functions for performing Bayesian similarity regression,
  and evaluating the probability of association between sets of ontological terms
  and binary response vector. A random model is compared with one in which
  the log odds of a true response is linked to the semantic similarity
  between terms and a latent characteristic ontological profile.
