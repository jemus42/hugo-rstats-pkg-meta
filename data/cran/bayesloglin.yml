description: The function MC3() searches for log-linear models with the highest posterior
  probability. The function gibbsSampler() is a blocked Gibbs sampler for sampling
  from the posterior distribution of the log-linear parameters. The functions findPostMean()
  and findPostCov() compute the posterior mean and covariance matrix for decomposable
  models which, for these models, is available in closed form.
