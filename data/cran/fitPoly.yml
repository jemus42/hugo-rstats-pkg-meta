title: Genotype Calling for Bi-Allelic Marker Assays
maintainer: Roeland E. Voorrips
description: |-
  Genotyping assays for bi-allelic markers (e.g. SNPs) produce
  signal intensities for the two alleles. 'fitPoly' assigns genotypes
  (allele dosages) to a collection of polyploid samples based on these
  signal intensities. 'fitPoly' replaces the older package 'fitTetra' that was
  limited (a.o.) to only tetraploid populations whereas 'fitPoly' accepts any
  ploidy level. Reference: Voorrips RE, Gort G, Vosman B (2011)
