title: Robust Estimation of the ACF from the M-Periodogram
maintainer: Higor Cotta
description: Non-robust and robust computations of the sample autocovariance (ACOVF)
  and sample autocorrelation functions (ACF) of univariate and multivariate processes.
  The methodology consists in reversing the diagonalization procedure involving the
  periodogram or the cross-periodogram and the Fourier transform vectors, and, thus,
  obtaining the ACOVF or the ACF as discussed in Fuller (1995) <doi:10.1002/9780470316917>.
  The robust version is obtained by fitting robust M-regressors to obtain the M-periodogram
  or M-cross-periodogram as discussed in Reisen et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2017.02.008>.
