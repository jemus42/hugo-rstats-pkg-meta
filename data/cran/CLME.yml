title: Constrained Inference for Linear Mixed Effects Models
maintainer: Casey M. Jelsema
description: |-
  Estimation and inference for linear models where some or all of the
  fixed-effects coefficients are subject to order restrictions. This package uses
  the robust residual bootstrap methodology for inference, and can handle some
  structure in the residual variance matrix.
