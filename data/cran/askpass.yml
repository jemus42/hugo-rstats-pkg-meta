title: Safe Password Entry for R, Git, and SSH
maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Cross-platform utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a
  passphrase, for example to authenticate with a server or read a protected key.
  Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no 'tcltk' is required.
  Password entry can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the
  askpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent'
  or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables.
  Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed
  when R calls out to git or ssh.
