title: Constrained L1-minimization for Inverse (covariance) Matrix<U+000a>Estimation
maintainer: Xi (Rossi) Luo
description: A robust constrained L1 minimization method for estimating<U+000a>a large
  sparse inverse covariance matrix (aka precision<U+000a>matrix), and recovering its
  support for building graphical<U+000a>models.  The computation uses linear programming.
