title: Network Reconstruction and Changepoint Detection
maintainer: Frank Dondelinger
description: |-
  Package EDISON (Estimation of Directed Interactions from
  Sequences Of Non-homogeneous gene expression) runs an MCMC
  simulation to reconstruct networks from time series data, using
  a non-homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network.
  Networks segments and changepoints are inferred concurrently,
  and information sharing priors provide a reduction of the
  inference uncertainty.
