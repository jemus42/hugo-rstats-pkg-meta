title: Simulation summary
maintainer: Gregor Gorjanc
description: |-
  simSummary is a small utility package which eases the
  process of summarizing simulation results. Simulations often
  produce intermediate results - some focal statistics that need
  to be summarized over several scenarios and many replications.
  This step is in principle easy, but tedious. The package
  simSummary fills this niche by providing a generic way of
  summarizing the focal statistics of simulations. The useR must
  provide properly structured input, holding focal statistics,
  and then the summary step can be performed with one line of
  code, calling the simSummary function.
