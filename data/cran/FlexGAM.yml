title: Generalized Additive Models with Flexible Response Functions
maintainer: Elmar Spiegel
description: |-
  Standard generalized additive models assume a response function,
  which induces an assumption on the shape of the distribution of the
  response. However, miss-specifying the response function results in biased
  estimates. Therefore in Spiegel et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9799-6> we propose to estimate the response function
  jointly with the covariate effects. This package provides the underlying
  functions to estimate these generalized additive models with flexible
  response functions. The estimation is based on an iterative algorithm. In
  the outer loop the response function is estimated, while in the inner loop
  the covariate effects are determined. For the response function a strictly
  monotone P-spline is used while the covariate effects are estimated based on
  a modified Fisher-Scoring algorithm. Overall the estimation relies on the
  'mgcv'-package.
