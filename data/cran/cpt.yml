title: Classification Permutation Test
maintainer: Johann Gagnon-Bartsch
description: Non-parametric test for equality of multivariate distributions.  Trains
  a classifier to classify (multivariate) observations as coming from one of several
  distributions.  If the classifier is able to classify the observations better than
  would be expected by chance (using permutation inference), then the null hypothesis
  that the distributions are equal is rejected.
