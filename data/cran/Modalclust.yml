title: Hierarchical Modal Clustering
maintainer: Surajit Ray
description: Performs Modal Clustering (MAC) including Hierarchical Modal Clustering
  (HMAC) along with their parallel implementation (PHMAC) over several processors.  These
  model-based non-parametric clustering techniques can extract  clusters in very high
  dimensions with arbitrary density shapes. By default clustering is performed over
  several resolutions and the results are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated
  plot functions are also provided. There is a package vignette that provides many
  examples. This version adheres to CRAN policy of not spanning more than two child
  processes by default.
