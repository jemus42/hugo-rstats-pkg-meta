description: Evaluating probabilistic forecasts via proper scoring rules.  scoring
  implements the beta, power, and pseudospherical families of proper scoring rules,
  along with ordered versions of the latter two families.  Included among these families
  are popular rules like the Brier (quadratic) score, logarithmic score, and spherical
  score.  For two-alternative forecasts, also includes functionality for plotting
  scores that one would obtain under specific scoring rules.
