title: General Bivariate Copula Theory and Many Utility Functions
maintainer: William Asquith
description: |-
  Extensive functions for bivariate copula (bicopula) computations and related operations
  for bicopula theory. The lower, upper, product, and select other bicopula are implemented along
  with operations including the diagonal, survival copula, dual of a copula, co-copula, and
  numerical bicopula density. Level sets, horizontal and vertical sections are supported. Numerical
  derivatives and inverses of a bicopula are provided through which simulation is implemented.
  Bicopula composition, convex combination, and products also are provided. Support
  extends to the Kendall Function as well as the Lmoments thereof. Kendall Tau,
  Spearman Rho and Footrule, Gini Gamma, Blomqvist Beta, Hoeffding Phi, Schweizer-
  Wolff Sigma, tail dependency, tail order, skewness, and bivariate Lmoments are implemented, and
  positive/negative quadrant dependency, left (right) increasing (decreasing) are available.
  Other features include Kullback-Leibler divergence, Vuong procedure, spectral measure, and
  Lcomoments for inference, maximum likelihood, and AIC, BIC, and RMSE for goodness-of-fit.
