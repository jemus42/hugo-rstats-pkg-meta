title: Quantile-Optimal Treatment Regimes with Censored Data
maintainer: Yu Zhou
description: |-
  Provides methods for estimation of mean- and quantile-optimal treatment regimes from censored data.
  Specifically, we have developed distinct functions for three types of right censoring for static treatment using quantile criterion: (1) independent/random censoring, (2) treatment-dependent random censoring, and (3) covariates-dependent random censoring. It also includes a function to estimate quantile-optimal dynamic treatment regimes for independent censored data. Finally, this package also includes a simulation data generative model of a dynamic treatment experiment proposed in literature.
