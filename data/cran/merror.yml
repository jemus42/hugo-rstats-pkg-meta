title: Accuracy and Precision of Measurements
maintainer: Richard A. Bilonick
description: |-
  N>=3 methods are used to measure each of n items.
  The data are used to estimate simultaneously systematic error (bias)
  and random error (imprecision). Observed measurements for each method
  or device are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
  and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Maximum likelihood
  estimation is used for the imprecision standard deviation estimates.
  Pairwise calibration curves and plots can be easily generated.
