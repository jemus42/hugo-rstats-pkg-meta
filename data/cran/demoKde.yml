title: Kernel Density Estimation for Demonstration Purposes
maintainer: Bill Venables
description: |-
  Demonstration code showing how (univariate) kernel
  density estimates are computed, at least conceptually,
  and allowing users to experiment with different kernels,
  should they so wish.  NOTE: the density function in the
  stats package should be used for computational efficiency.
