title: Manipulation of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint Documents
maintainer: David Gohel
description: |-
  Access and manipulate 'Microsoft Word' and 'Microsoft PowerPoint' documents from R.
  The package focuses on tabular and graphical reporting from R; it also provides two functions
  that let users get document content into data objects. A set of functions
  lets add and remove images, tables and paragraphs of text in new or existing documents.
  When working with 'PowerPoint' presentations, slides can be added or removed; shapes inside
  slides can also be added or removed. When working with 'Word' documents, a cursor can be
  used to help insert or delete content at a specific location in the document. The package
  does not require any installation of Microsoft products to be able to write Microsoft files.
