  A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple
  Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models
maintainer: Beilun Wang
description: This is an R implementation of "A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for
  Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models" (FASJEM). The FASJEM
  algorithm can be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. For instance,
  it can identify context-specific gene networks from multi-context gene expression
  datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional and
  heterogonous data sets, this tool  can help users effectively translate aggregated
  data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(fasjem)
  to learn the basic functions provided by this package. For more details, please
  see <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/wang17e/wang17e.pdf>.
