maintainer: Alexander P. Christensen
description: Implements several functions for the analysis of semantic networks including
  partial node bootstrapping (Kenett, Anaki, & Faust, 2014 <doi:10.3389/fnhum.2014.00407>),
  random walk simulation (Kenett & Austerweil, 2016 <http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/papers/files/Kenett16CreativityRW.pdf>),
