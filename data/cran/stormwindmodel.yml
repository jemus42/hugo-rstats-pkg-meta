title: Model Tropical Cyclone Wind Speeds
maintainer: Brooke Anderson
description: |-
  Allows users to input tracking data for a hurricane
  or other tropical storm, along with a data frame of grid points at which
  to model wind speeds. Functions in this package will then calculate wind
  speeds at each point based on wind model equations. This modeling framework
  is currently set up to model winds for North American locations with
  Atlantic basin storms. This work was supported
  in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health
  Sciences (R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation (1331399), and the
  Department of Energy (DE-FG02-08ER64644).
