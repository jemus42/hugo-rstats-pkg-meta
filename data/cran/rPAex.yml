  Automatic Detection of Experimental Unit in Precision
  Agriculture
maintainer: Felipe de Mendiburu
description: A part of precision agriculture is linked to the spectral image obtained
  from the cameras. With the image information of the agricultural experiment, the
  included functions facilitate the collection of spectral data associated with the
  experimental units. Some designs generated in R are linked to the images, which
  allows the use of the information of each pixel of the image in the experimental
  unit and the treatment. Tables and images are generated for the analysis of the
  precision agriculture experiment during the entire vegetative period of the crop.
