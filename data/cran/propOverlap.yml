  Feature (gene) selection based on the Proportional Overlapping
  Scores
maintainer: Osama Mahmoud
description: A package for selecting the most relevant features (genes) in the high-dimensional
  binary classification problems. The discriminative features are identified using
  analyzing the overlap between the expression values across both classes. The package
  includes functions for measuring the proportional overlapping score for each gene
  avoiding the outliers effect. The used measure for the overlap is the one defined
  in the "Proportional Overlapping Score (POS)" technique for feature selection. A
  gene mask which represents a gene's classification power can also be produced for
  each gene (feature). The set size of the selected genes might be set by the user.
  The minimum set of genes that correctly classify the maximum number of the given
  tissue samples (observations) can be also produced.
