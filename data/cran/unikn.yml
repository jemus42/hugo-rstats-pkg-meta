  Graphical Elements of the University of Konstanz's Corporate
  Design
maintainer: Hansjoerg Neth
description: Define and use graphical elements of corporate design manuals in R. The
  'unikn' package provides color functions (by defining dedicated colors and color
  palettes, and commands for changing, viewing, and using them) and styled text elements
  (e.g., for marking, underlining, or plotting colored titles). The pre-defined range
  of colors and text functions is based on the corporate design of the University
  of Konstanz <https://www.uni-konstanz.de/>, but can be adapted and extended for
  other institutions and purposes.
