  Penalized Estimation of Flexible Hidden Markov Models for Time
  Series of Counts
maintainer: Timo Adam
description: 'Provides tools for penalized estimation of flexible hidden Markov models
  for time series of counts w/o the need to specify a (parametric) family of distributions.
  These include functions for model fitting, model checking, and state decoding. For
  details, see Adam, T., Langrock, R., and Wei√ü, C.H. (2019): Penalized Estimation
  of Flexible Hidden Markov Models for Time Series of Counts. <arXiv:1901.03275>.'
