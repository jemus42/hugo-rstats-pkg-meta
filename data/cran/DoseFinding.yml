title: Planning and Analyzing Dose Finding Experiments
maintainer: Bjoern Bornkamp
description: |-
  The DoseFinding package provides functions for the design and analysis
  of dose-finding experiments (with focus on pharmaceutical Phase
  II clinical trials). It provides functions for: multiple contrast
  tests, fitting non-linear dose-response models (using Bayesian and
  non-Bayesian estimation), calculating optimal designs and an
  implementation of the MCPMod methodology (Pinheiro et al. (2014)
  <doi:10.1002/sim.6052>).
