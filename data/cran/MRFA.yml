  Fitting and Predicting Large-Scale Nonlinear Regression Problems
  using Multi-Resolution Functional ANOVA (MRFA) Approach
maintainer: Chih-Li Sung
description: |-
  Performs the MRFA approach proposed by Sung et al. (2019+) <arXiv:1709.07064> to fit
  and predict nonlinear regression problems, particularly for large-scale and
  high-dimensional problems. The application includes deterministic or stochastic
  computer experiments, spatial datasets, and so on.
