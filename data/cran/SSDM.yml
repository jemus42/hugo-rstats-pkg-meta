title: Stacked Species Distribution Modelling
maintainer: Sylvain Schmitt
description: |-
  Allows to map species richness and endemism based on stacked
  species distribution models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created using a
  single or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an SDM can
  yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a between-algorithm variance
  map, and can assess variable importance, algorithm accuracy, and between-
  algorithm correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing
  individual probabilities and thresholding then summing. Thresholding can be
  based on a specific evaluation metric or by drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli
  distribution. The SSDM package also provides a user-friendly interface.
