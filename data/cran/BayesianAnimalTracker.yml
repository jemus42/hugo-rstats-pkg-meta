title: Bayesian Melding of GPS and DR Path for Animal Tracking
maintainer: Yang (Seagle) Liu
description: Bayesian melding approach to combine the GPS observations and Dead-Reckoned
  path for an accurate animal's track, or equivalently, use the GPS observations to
  correct the Dead-Reckoned path. It can take the measurement errors in the GPS observations
  into account and provide uncertainty statement about the corrected path. The main
  calculation can be done by the BMAnimalTrack function.
