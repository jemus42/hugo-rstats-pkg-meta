title: Hilbert Similarity Index for High Dimensional Data
maintainer: Yann Abraham
description: |-
  Quantifying similarity between high-dimensional single cell samples is challenging, and usually requires
  some simplifying hypothesis to be made. By transforming the high dimensional space into a high dimensional grid,
  the number of cells in each sub-space of the grid is characteristic of a given sample. Using a Hilbert curve
  each sample can be visualized as a simple density plot, and the distance between samples can be calculated from
  the distribution of cells using the Jensen-Shannon distance. Bins that correspond to significant differences
  between samples can identified using a simple bootstrap procedure.
