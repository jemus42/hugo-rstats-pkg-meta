  Explore Probability Distributions for Bivariate Temporal
  Granularities
maintainer: Sayani Gupta
description: |-
  Provides tools for systematically exploring large quantities of
  temporal data across nonlinear temporal granularities
  (deconstructions of time) by visualizing probability distributions.
  Nonlinear time granularities can be circular, quasi-circular or
  aperiodic. 'gravitas' computes nonlinear
  single-order-up or multiple-order-up granularities, check the
  feasibility of creating plots for any two nonlinear granularities
  and recommend probability distributions plots for exploring
  periodicity in the data.
