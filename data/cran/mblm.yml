title: Median-Based Linear Models
maintainer: Lukasz Komsta
description: |-
  Provides linear models based on Theil-Sen
  single median and Siegel repeated medians. They are very robust
  (29 or 50 percent breakdown point, respectively), and if no
  outliers are present, the estimators are very similar to OLS.
