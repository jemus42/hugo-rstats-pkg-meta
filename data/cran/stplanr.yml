  Tools for transport planning with an emphasis on spatial transport
  data and non-motorized modes. Enables common transport planning tasks including:
  downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic "desire lines"
  from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and via
  interfaces to routing services such as <http://cyclestreets.net/>;
  calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow;
  and 'travel watershed' analysis.
