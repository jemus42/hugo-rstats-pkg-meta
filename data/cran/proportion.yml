  Inference on Single Binomial Proportion and Bayesian
  Computations
maintainer: Rajeswaran Viswanathan
description: Abundant statistical literature has revealed the importance of constructing
  and evaluating various methods for constructing confidence intervals (CI) for single
  binomial proportion (p). We comprehensively provide procedures in frequentist (approximate
  with or without adding pseudo counts or continuity correction or exact) and in Bayesian
  cultures. Evaluation procedures for CI warrant active computational attention and
  required summaries pertaining to  four criterion (coverage probability, expected
  length, p-confidence, p-bias, and error) are implemented.
