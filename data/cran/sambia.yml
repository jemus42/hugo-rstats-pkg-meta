title: A Collection of Techniques Correcting for Sample Selection Bias
maintainer: Norbert Krautenbacher
description: A collection of various techniques correcting statistical models for
  sample selection bias is provided. In particular, the resampling-based methods "stochastic
  inverse-probability oversampling" and "parametric inverse-probability bagging" are
  placed at the disposal which generate synthetic observations for correcting classifiers
  for biased samples resulting from stratified random sampling. For further information,
  see the article Krautenbacher, Theis, and Fuchs (2017) <doi:10.1155/2017/7847531>.
  The methods may be used for further purposes where weighting and generation of new
  observations is needed.
