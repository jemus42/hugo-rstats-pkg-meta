version: 0.1.0
title: API to 'Python' Library 'pysd'
maintainer: Jim Duggan
description: |-
  Using the R package 'reticulate', this package creates an interface to the 'pysd' toolset.
  The package provides an R interface to a number of 'pysd' functions, and can read files in
  'Vensim' 'mdl' format, and 'xmile' format. The resulting simulations are returned as a 'tibble', and from
  that the results can be processed using 'dplyr' and 'ggplot2'. The package has been tested  using 'python3'.
