title: Automatically Generate _site.yml File for 'R Markdown'
maintainer: Adam Cribbs
description: |-
  The goal of 'siteymlgen' is to make it easy to organise
  the building of your 'R Markdown' website.
  The init() function placed within the first code chunk of the index.Rmd
  file of an 'R' project directory will initiate the generation of an automatically
  written _site.yml file. 'siteymlgen' recommends a specific naming
  convention for your 'R Markdown' files. This naming will ensure that
  your navbar layout is ordered according to a hierarchy.
