title: Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks
maintainer: Ege Ulgen
description: |-
  Enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms
  underlying a phenotype. However, conventional methods for enrichment
  analysis do not take into account protein-protein interaction information,
  resulting in incomplete conclusions. pathfindR is a tool for enrichment
  analysis utilizing active subnetworks. The main function identifies active
  subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided
  list of genes and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses
  on the identified subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e. pathways or,
  more broadly, gene sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest.
  pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and
  identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms
  per sample and to visualize analysis results. The enrichment, clustering and
  other methods implemented in pathfindR are described in detail in

  Comprehensive Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through
  Active Subnetworks. Front. Genet. <doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.00858>.
