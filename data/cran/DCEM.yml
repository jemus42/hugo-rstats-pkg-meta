  Clustering for Multivariate and Univariate Data Using
  Expectation Maximization Algorithm
maintainer: Sharma Parichit
description: |-
  Implements the Improved Expectation Maximisation EM* and the traditional EM algorithm for clustering
  finite gaussian mixture models for both multivariate and univariate datasets. The initialization is done by randomly
  selecting the samples from the dataset as the mean (meu) of the Gaussian(s). This version implements the faster alternative
  EM* that avoids revisiting data by leveraging the heap structure. The algorithm returns a set of Gaussian
  parameters-posterior probabilities, mean (meu), co-variance matrices (multivariate)/standard-deviation
  (univariate) and priors. Reference: Hasan Kurban, Mark Jenne, Mehmet M. Dalkilic (2016) <doi:10.1007/s41060-017-0062-1>.
