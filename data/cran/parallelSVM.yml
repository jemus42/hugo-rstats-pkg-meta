  A Parallel-Voting Version of the Support-Vector-Machine
  Algorithm
maintainer: Wannes Rosiers
description: By sampling your data, running the Support-Vector-Machine algorithm on
  these samples in parallel on your own machine and letting your models vote on a
  prediction, we return much faster predictions than the regular Support-Vector-Machine
  and possibly even more accurate predictions.
