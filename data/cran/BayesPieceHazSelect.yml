  Variable Selection in a Hierarchical Bayesian Model for a Hazard
  Function
maintainer: Andrew Chapple
description: |-
  Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a
  Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive
  formulation for the spatial dependency in the hazard rates for each piece.
  This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of split
  points to vary and also uses Stochastic Search Variable Selection to determine
  what covariates drive the risk of the event. This function outputs trace plots
  depicting the number of split points in the hazard and the number of variables
  included in the hazard. The function saves all posterior quantities to the
  desired path.
