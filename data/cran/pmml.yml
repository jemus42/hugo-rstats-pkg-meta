title: Generate PMML for Various Models
maintainer: Dmitriy Bolotov
description: The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language
  which provides a way for applications to define machine learning, statistical and
  data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications. More
  information about the PMML industry standard and the Data Mining Group can be found
  at <http://www.dmg.org>. The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
  application, such as Zementis Predictive Analytics products, which integrate with
  web services, relational database systems and deploy natively on Hadoop in conjunction
  with Hive, Spark or Storm, as well as allow predictive analytics to be executed
  for IBM z Systems mainframe applications and real-time, streaming analytics platforms.
  The package isofor (used for anomaly detection) can be installed with devtools::install_github("Zelazny7/isofor").
