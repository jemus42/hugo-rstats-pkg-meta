title: Meta-analysis of Multivariate Genome Wide Association Studies
maintainer: Dragana Vuckovic
description: |-
  Allows running a meta-analysis of multivariate Genome Wide
  Association Studies (GWAS) and easily visualizing results through custom
  plotting functions. The multivariate setting implies that results for each
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) include several effect sizes (also
  known as "beta coefficients", one for each trait), as well as related
  variance values, but also covariance between the betas. The main goal of
  the package is to provide combined beta coefficients across different
  cohorts, together with the combined variance/covariance matrix. The method
  is inverse-variance based, thus each beta is weighted by the inverse of its
  variance-covariance matrix, before taking the average across all betas. The
  default options of the main function \code{multi_meta} will work with files
  obtained from GEMMA multivariate option for GWAS (Zhou & Stephens, 2014).
  It will work with any other output, as soon as columns are formatted to
  have the according names. The package also provides several plotting
  functions for QQ-plots, Manhattan Plots and custom summary plots.
