  Data Exploration with Information Theory (Weight-of-Evidence and
  Information Value)
maintainer: Larsen Kim
description: |-
  Performs exploratory data analysis and variable screening for
  binary classification models using weight-of-evidence (WOE) and information
  value (IV). In order to make the package as efficient as possible, aggregations
  are done in data.table and creation of WOE vectors can be distributed across
  multiple cores. The package also supports exploration for uplift models (NWOE
  and NIV).
