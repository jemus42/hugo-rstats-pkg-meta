title: Simulation-Based False Discovery Rate in RNA-Seq
maintainer: Mikhail V. Matz
description: Auxiliary functions for the DESeq2 package to simulate read counts according
  to the null hypothesis (i.e., with empirical sample size factors, per-gene total
  counts and dispersions, but without effects of predictor variables) and to compute
  the empirical false discovery rate.
