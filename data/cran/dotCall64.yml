title: Enhanced Foreign Function Interface Supporting Long Vectors
maintainer: Florian Gerber
description: |-
  Provides .C64(), which is an enhanced version of .C()
  and .Fortran() from the foreign function interface. .C64() supports long
  vectors, arguments of type 64-bit integer, and provides a mechanism to
  avoid unnecessary copies of read-only and write-only arguments. This
  makes it a convenient and fast interface to C/C++ and Fortran code.
