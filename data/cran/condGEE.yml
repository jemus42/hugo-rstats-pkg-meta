title: Parameter estimation in conditional GEE for recurrent event gap<U+000a>times
maintainer: David Clement
description: Solves for the mean parameters, the variance parameter, and their asymptotic
  variance in a conditional GEE for recurrent event gap times, as described by Clement
  and Strawderman (2009) in the journal Biostatistics. Makes a parametric assumption
  for the length of the censored gap time.
