title: Read and Write 'FreeSurfer' Neuroimaging File Formats
maintainer: Tim Sch√§fer
description: 'Provides functions to read and write data from neuroimaging files in
  ''FreeSurfer'' <http://freesurfer.net/> binary formats. This includes, but is not
  limited to, the following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files, which can contain
  multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional
  brain scans acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also contain
  vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The MGH format is named after
  the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the MGZ format is a compressed version of
  the same format. 2) ''FreeSurfer'' morphometry data files in binary ''curv'' format.
  These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar value for each vertex
  of a brain surface mesh. These are typically values like the cortical thickness
  or brain surface area at each vertex. 3) Annotation file format. This contains a
  brain surface parcellation derived from a cortical atlas. 4) Surface file format.
  Contains a brain surface mesh, given by a list of vertices and a list of faces.'
