maintainer: Nelson Lee Afanador
description: An open-source implementation of latent variable methods and multivariate
  modeling tools. The focus is on exploratory analyses using dimensionality reduction
  methods including low dimensional embedding, classical multivariate statistical
  tools, and tools for enhanced interpretation of machine learning methods (i.e. intelligible
  models to provide important information for end-users).   Target domains include
  extension to dedicated applications e.g. for manufacturing process modeling, spectroscopic
  analyses, and data mining.
