title: Phenotypic Integration Index
maintainer: A. J. Muñoz-Pajares
description: Provides functions to estimate the size-controlled phenotypic integration
  index, a novel method by Torices & Méndez (2014) to solve problems due to individual
  size when estimating integration (namely, larger individuals have larger components,
  which will drive a correlation between components only due to resource availability
  that might obscure the observed measures of integration). In addition, the package
  also provides the classical estimation by Wagner (1984), bootstrapping and jackknife
  methods to calculate confidence intervals and a significance test for both integration
  indices.
