title: Validation of Local and Remote Data Tables
maintainer: Richard Iannone
description: |-
  Validate data in data frames, 'tibble' objects, and in database
  tables (e.g., 'PostgreSQL' and 'MySQL'). Validation pipelines can be made
  using easily-readable, consecutive validation steps. Upon execution of the
  validation plan, several reporting options are available. User-defined
  thresholds for failure rates allow for the determination of appropriate
  reporting actions.
