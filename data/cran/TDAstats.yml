title: Pipeline for Topological Data Analysis
maintainer: Raoul Wadhwa
description: |-
  A comprehensive toolset for any
  useR conducting topological data analysis, specifically via the
  calculation of persistent homology in a Vietoris-Rips complex.
  The tools this package currently provides can be conveniently split
  into three main sections: (1) calculating persistent homology; (2)
  conducting statistical inference on persistent homology calculations;
  (3) visualizing persistent homology and statistical inference.
  The published form of TDAstats can be found in Wadhwa et al. (2018)
  <doi:10.21105/joss.00860>.
  For a general background on computing persistent homology for
  topological data analysis, see Otter et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5>.
  To learn more about how the permutation test is used for
  nonparametric statistical inference in topological data analysis,
  read Robinson & Turner (2017) <doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7>.
  To learn more about how TDAstats calculates persistent homology,
  you can visit the GitHub repository for Ripser, the software that
  works behind the scenes at <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser>.
