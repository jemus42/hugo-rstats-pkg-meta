  Change-Point Estimation for Expensive and High-Dimensional
  Models
maintainer: Leland Bybee
description: This implements the methods developed in, L. Bybee and Y. Atchade. (2018).  Contains
  a series of methods for estimating change-points given user specified black-box
  models.  The methods include binary segmentation for multiple change-point estimation.
  For estimating each individual change-point the package includes simulated annealing,
  brute force, and, for Gaussian graphical models, an applications specific rank-one
  update implementation.  Additionally, code for estimating Gaussian graphical models
  is included.  The goal of this package is to allow for the efficient estimation
  of change-points in complicated models with high dimensional data.
