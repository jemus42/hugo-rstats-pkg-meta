title: Optimal Designs for Copula Models
maintainer: Andreas Rappold
description: |-
  A direct approach to optimal designs for copula models based on
  the Fisher information. Provides flexible functions for building joint PDFs,
  evaluating the Fisher information and finding optimal designs. It includes an
  extensible solution to summation and integration called 'nint', functions for
  transforming, plotting and comparing designs, as well as a set of tools for
  common low-level tasks.
