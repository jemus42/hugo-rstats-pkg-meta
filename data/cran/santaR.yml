title: Short Asynchronous Time-Series Analysis
maintainer: Arnaud Wolfer
description: |-
  A graphical and automated pipeline for the analysis
  of short time-series in R ('santaR'). This approach is designed to accommodate asynchronous
  time sampling (i.e. different time points for different individuals),
  inter-individual variability, noisy measurements and large numbers of variables.
  Based on a smoothing splines functional model, 'santaR' is able to detect variables
  highlighting significantly different temporal trajectories between study groups.
  Designed initially for metabolic phenotyping, 'santaR' is also suited for other Systems Biology
  disciplines. Command line and graphical analysis (via a 'shiny' application) enable fast and
  parallel automated analysis and reporting, intuitive visualisation and comprehensive plotting
  options for non-specialist users.
