  Inference, Goodness-of-Fit and Forecast for Univariate Gaussian
  Hidden Markov Models
maintainer: Bouchra Nasri
description: Inference, goodness-of-fit test, and prediction densities and intervals
  for univariate Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The goodness-of-fit is based
  on a Cramer-von Mises statistic and uses parametric bootstrap to estimate the p-value.
  The description of the methodology is taken from Chapter 10.2 of Remillard (2013)
  <doi:10.1201/b14285>.
