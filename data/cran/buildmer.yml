  Stepwise Elimination and Term Reordering for Mixed-Effects
  Regression
maintainer: Cesko C. Voeten
description: |-
  Finds the largest possible regression model that will still converge
  for various types of regression analyses (including mixed models and generalized
  additive models) and then optionally performs stepwise elimination similar to the
  forward and backward effect-selection methods in SAS, based on the change in
  log-likelihood or its significance, Akaike's Information Criterion, the Bayesian
  Information Criterion, or the explained deviance.
