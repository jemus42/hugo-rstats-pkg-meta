  Fit Continuous-Time State-Space and Latent Variable Models for
  Filtering Argos Satellite (and Other) Telemetry Data and
  Estimating Movement Behaviour
maintainer: Ian Jonsen
description: 'Fits continuous-time random walk and correlated random walk state-space
  models to filter animal tracking data (''Argos'', processed light-level ''geolocation'',
  ''GPS''). Template Model Builder (''TMB'') is used for fast estimation. The ''Argos''
  data can be: (older) least squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman filter-based
  locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both. The models estimate
  two sets of location states corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually)
  irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular).
  Latent variable models are provided to estimate move persistence along tracks as
  an index of behaviour. ''Jonsen I'', ''McMahon CR'', ''Patterson TA'', ''Auger-Methe
