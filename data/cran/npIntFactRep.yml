  Nonparametric Interaction Tests for Factorial Designs with
  Repeated Measures
maintainer: Jos Feys
description: 'Returns nonparametric aligned rank tests for the interaction in two-way
  factorial designs, on R data sets with repeated measures in ''wide'' format. Five
  ANOVAs tables are reported. A PARAMETRIC one on the original data, one for a CHECK
  upon the interaction alignments, and three aligned rank tests: one on the aligned
  REGULAR, one on the FRIEDMAN, and one on the KOCH ranks. In these rank tests, only
  the resulting values for the interaction are relevant.'
