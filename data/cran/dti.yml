title: Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) Data
maintainer: Karsten Tabelow
description: |-
  Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
  modality, that measures diffusion of water in tissues like the human
  brain. The package contains R-functions to process diffusion-weighted
  data. The functionality includes diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),
  diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), modeling for high angular resolution
  diffusion weighted imaging (HARDI) using Q-ball-reconstruction and
  tensor mixture models, several methods for structural adaptive
  smoothing including POAS and msPOAS, and a streamline fiber tracking
  for tensor and tensor mixture models.
  The package provides functionality to manipulate and visualize results
  in 2D and 3D.
