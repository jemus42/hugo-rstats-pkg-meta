title: Joint Approximate Diagonalization of a Set of Square Matrices
maintainer: Cedric Gouy-Pailler
description: |-
  Different algorithms to perform approximate joint diagonalization
  of a finite set of square matrices. Depending on the algorithm,
  orthogonal or non-orthogonal diagonalizer is found. These algorithms
  are particularly useful in the context of blind source separation.
