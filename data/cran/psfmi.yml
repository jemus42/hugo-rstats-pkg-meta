  Prediction Model Selection and Performance Evaluation in
  Multiple Imputed Datasets
maintainer: Martijn Heymans
description: "\nProvides functions to apply pooling or backward selection\nof logistic,
  Cox regression and Multilevel (mixed models) prediction\nmodels in multiply imputed
  datasets. Backward selection can be done\nfrom the pooled model using Rubin's Rules
  (RR), the D1, D2, D3 and\npromising median p-values method. The model can contain\ncontinuous,
  dichotomous, categorical predictors and interaction terms\nbetween all\tthese type
  of predictors. Continuous predictors\tcan also\nbe introduced as restricted cubic
  spline coefficients. It is also possible\nto force (spline) predictors or interaction
  terms in the model during predictor\nselection. The package includes a function
  to evaluate the stability\nof the models\tusing bootstrapping and cluster bootstrapping.
  The package further\ncontains functions to generate pooled model performance measures
  in multiply\nimputed datasets as ROC/AUC, R-squares, Brier score, fit test values
  and\ncalibration\tplots for logistic regression models. A function to apply\nBootstrap
  internal validation\tis also available where two methods can be\nused to combine
  bootstrapping and\tmultiple imputation. One method, boot_MI,\nfirst draws\tbootstrap
  samples and\tsubsequently performs multiple imputation and with\nthe other method,
  MI_boot, first bootstrap samples are drawn from each imputed\ndataset before results
  are combined. The adjusted intercept after shrinkage of\nthe pooled regression coefficients
  can be subsequently obtained. Backward selection\nas part of internal validation
  is also an option. Also a function to externally\nvalidate logistic\tprediction
  models in multiple imputed datasets is available.\nEekhout (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12874-017-0404-7>.\nWiel
