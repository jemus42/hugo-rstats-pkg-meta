title: Cubature over Polygonal Domains
maintainer: Sebastian Meyer
description: |-
  Numerical integration of continuously differentiable
  functions f(x,y) over simple closed polygonal domains.
  The following cubature methods are implemented:
  product Gauss cubature (Sommariva and Vianello, 2007,
  <doi:10.1007/s10543-007-0131-2>),
  the simple two-dimensional midpoint rule
  (wrapping 'spatstat' functions),
  adaptive cubature for radially symmetric functions via line
  integrate() along the polygon boundary (Meyer and Held, 2014,
  <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>, Supplement B),
  and integration of the bivariate Gaussian density based on
  polygon triangulation.
  For simple integration along the axes, the 'cubature' package
  is more appropriate.
