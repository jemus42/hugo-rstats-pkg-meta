title: 'bPeaks: an intuitive peak-calling strategy to detect<U+000a>transcription
  factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data in small<U+000a>eukaryotic genomes'
maintainer: Gaelle LELANDAIS
description: bPeaks is a simple approach to identify transcription factor binding
  sites from ChIP-seq data. Our general philosophy is to provide an easy-to-use tool,
  well-adapted for small eukaryotic genomes (< 20 Mb). bPeaks uses a combination of
  4 cutoffs (T1, T2, T3 and T4) to mimic "good peak" properties as described by biologists
  who visually inspect the ChIP-seq data on a genome browser. For yeast genomes, bPeaks
  calculates the proportion of peaks that fall in promoter sequences. These peaks
  are good candidates as transcription factor binding sites.
