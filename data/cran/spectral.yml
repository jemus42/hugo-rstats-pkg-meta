title: Common Methods of Spectral Data Analysis
maintainer: Martin Seilmayer
description: |-
  Fourier and Hilbert transforms are utilized to perform several
  types of spectral analysis on the supplied data. Fragmented and irregularly
  spaced data can be processed in terms of Lomb-Scargle method. Both,
  FFT as well as LOMB methods take multivariate data. A user friendly
  interface helps to interpret the results.
