title: A Diceware Passphrase Implementation
maintainer: Francois Michonneau
description: |-
  The Diceware method can be used to generate strong passphrases.
  In short, you roll a 6-faced dice 5 times in a row, the number obtained is
  matched against a dictionary of easily remembered words. By combining together 7
  words thus generated, you obtain a password that is relatively easy to remember,
  but would take several millions years (on average) for a powerful computer to guess.
