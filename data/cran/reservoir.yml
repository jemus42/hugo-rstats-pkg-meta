description: |-
  Measure single-storage water supply system performance using resilience,
  reliability, and vulnerability metrics; assess storage-yield-reliability
  relationships; determine no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize
  release decisions for water supply, hydropower, and multi-objective reservoirs
  using deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming; generate inflow
  replicates using parametric and non-parametric models; evaluate inflow
  persistence using the Hurst coefficient.
