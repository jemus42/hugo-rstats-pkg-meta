title: Model of Adaptive Trait Evolution
maintainer: Dwueng-Chwuan Jhwueng
description: Performs statistical inference on the models of adaptive trait evolution
  under approximate Bayesian computation. This can simulate traits from four models,
  compute trait data summary statistics. Parameters are estimated under Approximate
  Bayesian Computation, model selection as well as posterior parameter mean will be
  reported. Users need to enter a comparative dataset and a phylogenetic tree.
