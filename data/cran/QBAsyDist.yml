title: Asymmetric Distributions and Quantile Estimation
maintainer: Md Rezaul Karim
description: Provides the local polynomial maximum likelihood estimates for the location
  and scale functions as well as the semiparametric quantile estimates in the generalized
  quantile-based asymmetric distributional setting. These functions are useful for
  any member of the generalized quantile-based asymmetric family of distributions.
