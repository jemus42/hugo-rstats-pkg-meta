title: Limit of Detection Imputation for Single-Pollutant Models
maintainer: Alexander Rix
description: |-
  Impute observed values below the limit of detection (LOD) via
  censored likelihood multiple imputation (CLMI) in single-pollutant
  models, developed by Boss et al (2019) <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000001052>.
  CLMI handles exposure detection limits that may change throughout the course
  of exposure assessment. 'lodi' provides functions for imputing and
  pooling for this method.
