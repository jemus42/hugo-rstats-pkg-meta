title: Multiple Curve Comparisons Using Parametric Bootstrap
maintainer: Christopher Murphy
description: Performs multiple comparison procedures on curve observations among different
  treatment groups. The methods are applicable in a variety of situations (such as
  independent groups with equal or unequal sample sizes, or repeated measures) by
  using parametric bootstrap. References to these procedures can be found at Konietschke,
  Gel, and Brunner (2014) <doi:10.1090/conm/622/12431> and Westfall (2011) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2011.607751>.
