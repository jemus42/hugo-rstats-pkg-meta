title: Ordered Homogeneity Pursuit Lasso for Group Variable Selection
maintainer: Nan Xiao
description: |-
  Ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL)
  algorithm for group variable selection proposed in Lin et al. (2017)
  <DOI:10.1016/j.chemolab.2017.07.004>. The OHPL method exploits the
  homogeneity structure in high-dimensional data and enjoys the
  grouping effect to select groups of important variables
  automatically. This feature makes it particularly useful for
  high-dimensional datasets with strongly correlated variables,
  such as spectroscopic data.
