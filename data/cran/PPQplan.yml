  Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Statistical Analysis
maintainer: Yalin Zhu
description: Assessment for statistically-based PPQ sampling plan, including calculating
  the passing probability, optimizing the baseline and high performance cutoff points,
  visualizing the PPQ plan and power dynamically. The analytical idea is based on
  the simulation methods from the textbook "Burdick, R. K., LeBlond, D. J., Pfahler,
  L. B., Quiroz, J., Sidor, L., Vukovinsky, K., & Zhang, L. (2017). Statistical Methods
  for CMC Applications. In Statistical Applications for Chemistry, Manufacturing and
  Controls (CMC) in the Pharmaceutical Industry (pp. 227-250). Springer, Cham."
