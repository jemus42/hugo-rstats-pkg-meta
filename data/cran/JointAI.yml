version: 0.6.1
title: Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data
maintainer: Nicole S. Erler
description: |-
  Provides joint analysis and imputation of (generalized)
  linear and cumulative logit regression models, (generalized) linear and
  cumulative logit mixed models and parametric (Weibull) as well as Cox
  proportional hazards survival models with incomplete (covariate) data in
  the Bayesian framework.
  The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
  model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS'
  <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net> with the help of
  the package 'rjags'.
  It also provides summary and plotting functions for the output and allows
  the user to export imputed values.
