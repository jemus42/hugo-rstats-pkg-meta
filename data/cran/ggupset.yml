title: Combination Matrix Axis for 'ggplot2' to Create 'UpSet' Plots
maintainer: Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze
description: |-
  Replace the standard x-axis in 'ggplots' with a combination matrix
  to visualize complex set overlaps. 'UpSet' has introduced a new way to visualize
  the overlap of sets as an alternative to Venn diagrams.
  This package provides a simple way to produce such plots using 'ggplot2'.
  In addition it can convert any categorical axis into a combination
  matrix axis.
