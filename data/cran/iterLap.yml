  Approximate Probability Densities by Iterated Laplace
  Approximations
maintainer: Bjoern Bornkamp
description: |-
  The iterLap (iterated Laplace approximation) algorithm approximates a
  general (possibly non-normalized) probability density on R^p, by repeated
  Laplace approximations to the difference between current approximation
  and true density (on log scale). The final approximation is a mixture of
  multivariate normal distributions and might be used for example as a
  proposal distribution for importance sampling (eg in Bayesian applications).
  The algorithm can be seen as a computational generalization of the Laplace
  approximation suitable for skew or multimodal densities.
