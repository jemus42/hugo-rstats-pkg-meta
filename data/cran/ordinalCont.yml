title: Ordinal Regression Analysis for Continuous Scales
maintainer: Maurizio Manuguerra
description: |-
  A regression framework for response variables which are continuous
  self-rating scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain
  assessment, or the Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality
  of life studies. These scales measure subjects' perception of an intangible
  quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their inherent
  non-linearity. We treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a continuous
  scale. A function (the g function) connects the scale with an underlying
  continuous latent variable. The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the
  assumed underlying distribution of the latent variable. A variety of
  link functions are currently implemented.
