title: Drawing Graphs with 'grid'
maintainer: Paul Murrell
description: |-
  Functions for drawing node-and-edge graphs that have been
  laid out by graphviz.  This provides an alternative
  rendering to that provided by the 'Rgraphviz' package, with
  two main advantages:  the rendering provided by 'gridGraphviz'
  should be more similar to what 'graphviz' itself would draw;
  and rendering with 'grid' allows for post-hoc customisations
  using the named viewports and grobs that 'gridGraphviz'
  produces.
