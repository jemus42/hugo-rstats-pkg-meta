title: Covariate Adaptive Clustering
maintainer: Joshua Keller
description: Implements the predictive k-means method for clustering observations,
  using a mixture of experts model to allow covariates to influence cluster centers.
  Motivated by air pollution epidemiology settings, where cluster membership needs
  to be predicted across space. Includes functions for predicting cluster membership
  using spatial splines and principal component analysis (PCA) scores using either
  multinomial logistic regression or support vector machines (SVMs). For method details
  see Keller et al. (2017) <doi:10.1214/16-AOAS992>.
