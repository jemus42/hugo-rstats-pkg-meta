title: Calculates Goodness of Fit Statistics
maintainer: Alper Gulbe
description: Calculates 15 different goodness of fit criteria. These are; standard
  deviation ratio (SDR), coefficient of variation (CV), relative root mean square
  error (RRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficients (PC), root mean square error (RMSE),
  performance index (PI), mean error (ME), global relative approximation error (RAE),
  mean relative approximation error (MRAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
  mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination (R-squared), adjusted
  coefficient of determination (adjusted R-squared), Akaike's information criterion
  (AIC), and corrected Akaike's information criterion (CAIC).
