title: Smooth Hazard Ratio Curves Taking a Reference Value
maintainer: Artur Araujo
description: |-
  Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear
  relationships between continuous predictors and survival. To
  better understand the effects that each continuous covariate
  has on the outcome, results are ex pressed in terms of hazard
  ratio curves, taking a specific covariate value as reference.
  Confidence bands for these curves are also derived.
