title: Statistical Toolbox for Sedimentary Provenance Analysis
maintainer: Pieter Vermeesch
description: Bundles a number of established statistical methods to facilitate the
  visual interpretation of large datasets in sedimentary geology. Includes functionality
  for adaptive kernel density estimation, principal component analysis, correspondence
  analysis, multidimensional scaling, generalised procrustes analysis and individual
  differences scaling using a variety of dissimilarity measures. Univariate provenance
  proxies, such as single-grain ages or (isotopic) compositions are compared with
  the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper or Sircombe-Hazelton L2 distances. Categorical provenance
  proxies such as chemical compositions are compared with the Aitchison and Bray-Curtis
  distances, and point-counting data with the chi-square distance. Also included are
  tools to plot compositional and point-counting data on ternary diagrams and point-counting
  data on radial plots, to calculate the sample size required for specified levels
  of statistical precision, and to assess the effects of hydraulic sorting on detrital
  compositions. Includes an intuitive query-based user interface for users who are
  not proficient in R.
