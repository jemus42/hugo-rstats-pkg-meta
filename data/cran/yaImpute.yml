title: Nearest Neighbor Observation Imputation and Evaluation Tools
maintainer: Nicholas L. Crookston
description: |-
  Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more alternative
  approaches to processing multivariate data. These include methods based on canonical
  correlation analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate adaptation
  of the random forest classification and regression techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele
  Cutler. Additional methods are also offered. The package includes functions for
  comparing the results from running alternative techniques, detecting imputation targets
  that are notably distant from reference observations, detecting and correcting
  for bias, bootstrapping and building ensemble imputations, and mapping results.
