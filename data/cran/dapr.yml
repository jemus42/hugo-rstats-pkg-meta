title: '''purrr''-Like Apply Functions Over Input Elements'
maintainer: Michael W. Kearney
description: |-
  An easy-to-use, dependency-free set of functions for iterating over
  elements of various input objects. Functions are wrappers around base
  apply()/lapply()/vapply() functions but designed to have similar
  functionality to the mapping functions in the 'purrr' package
  <https://purrr.tidyverse.org/>. Specifically, function names more explicitly
  communicate the expected class of the output and functions also allow for
  the convenient shortcut of '~ .x' instead of the more verbose
  'function(.x) .x'.
