  Tools to help text files importation. It can return
  the number of lines; print the first and last lines; convert
  encoding. Operations are made without reading the entire file
  before starting, resulting in good performances with large files.

  'head', 'tail', 'wc' and 'iconv' programs that are not always
  available on machine where R is installed.
