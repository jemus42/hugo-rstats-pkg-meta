  Fit Latent Dirichlet Allocation Models using Stochastic
  Variational Inference
maintainer: Nicholas Erskine
description: Fits Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models to text data using the
  stochastic variational inference algorithm described in Hoffman et. al. (2013) <arXiv:1206.7051v3>.
  This method is more efficient than the original batch variational inference algorithm
  for LDA, and allows users to fit LDA models with more topics and to larger text
  corpora than would be feasible using that older method.
