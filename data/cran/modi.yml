  Multivariate Outlier Detection and Imputation for Incomplete
  Survey Data
maintainer: Martin Sterchi
description: |-
  Algorithms for multivariate outlier detection when missing values occur.
  Algorithms are based on Mahalanobis distance or data depth. Imputation is based
  on the multivariate normal model or uses nearest neighbour donors. The algorithms
  take sample designs, in particular weighting, into account. The methods are
  described in Bill and Hulliger (2016) <doi:10.17713/ajs.v45i1.86>.
