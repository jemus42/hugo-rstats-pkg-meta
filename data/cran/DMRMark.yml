  DMR Detection by Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Model from
  Methylation Array Data
maintainer: Linghao SHEN
description: |-
  Perform differential analysis for
  methylation array data. Detect differentially
  methylated regions (DMRs) from array M-values.
  The core is a Non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model
  for estimating spatial correlation and a novel Constrained
  Gaussian Mixture Model for modeling the M-value pairs of each individual locus.
