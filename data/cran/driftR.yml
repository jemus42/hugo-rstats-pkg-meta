title: Drift Correcting Water Quality Data
maintainer: Andrew Shaughnessy
description: |-
  A tidy implementation of equations that correct for instrumental drift in
  continuous water quality monitoring data.  There are many sources of water quality data
  including private (ex: YSI instruments) and open source (ex: USGS and NDBC), each of
  which are susceptible to errors/inaccuracies due to drift. This package allows the
  user to correct their data using one or two standard reference values in a uniform,
  reproducible way. The equations implemented are from Hasenmueller (2011)
