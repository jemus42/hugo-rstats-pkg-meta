title: R Interface to NLopt
maintainer: Jelmer Ypma
description: |2-

  Solve optimization problems using an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a
  free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, providing a common
  interface for a number of different free optimization routines available
  online as well as original implementations of various other algorithms.
  See <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction> for more
  information on the available algorithms. During installation of nloptr on
  Unix-based systems, the installer checks whether the NLopt library is
  installed on the system. If the NLopt library cannot be found, the code
  is compiled using the NLopt source included in the nloptr package.
