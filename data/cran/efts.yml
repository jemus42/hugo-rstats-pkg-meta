  High-Level Functions to Read and Write Ensemble Forecast Time
  Series in netCDF
maintainer: Jean-Michel Perraud
description: |-
  The binary file format 'netCDF' is developed primarily for climate, ocean and
  meteorological data, and 'efts' is a package to read and write Ensemble Forecast Time
  Series data in 'netCDF'. 'netCDF' has traditionally been used to store time slices
  of gridded data, rather than complete time series of point data.
  'efts' facilitates data handling stored in 'netCDF' files that follow a convention
  devised in the domain of ensemble hydrologic forecasting, but possibly applicable
  in other domains. 'efts' uses reference class objects to
  provide a high level interface to read and write such data, wrapping
  lower level operations performed using 'ncdf4'.
