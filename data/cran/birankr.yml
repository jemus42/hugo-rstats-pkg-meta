title: Ranking Nodes in Bipartite and Weighted Networks
maintainer: Brian Aronson
description: Highly efficient functions for estimating various rank (centrality) measures
  of nodes in bipartite graphs (two-mode networks). Includes methods for estimating
  HITS, CoHITS, BGRM, and BiRank with implementation primarily inspired by He et al.
  (2016) <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2611584>. Also provides easy-to-use tools for efficiently
  estimating PageRank in one-mode graphs, incorporating or removing edge-weights during
  rank estimation, projecting two-mode graphs to one-mode, and for converting edgelists
  and matrices to sparseMatrix format. Best of all, the package's rank estimators
  can work directly with common formats of network data including edgelists (class
  data.frame, data.table, or tbl_df) and adjacency matrices (class matrix or dgCMatrix).
