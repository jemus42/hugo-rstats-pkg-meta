  Plotting, Smoothing and Growth Trait Extraction for Longitudinal
  Data
maintainer: Chris Brien
description: |-
  Assists in producing longitudinal or profile plots of measured
  traits. These allow checks to be made for anomalous data and growth patterns
  in the data to be explored. Smoothing of growth trends for individual plants
  using smoothing splines is available for removing transient effects. There
  are tools for diagnosing the adequacy of trait smoothing, either using this
  package or other packages, such as those that fit nonlinear growth models.
  A range of per-unit (pot, plant, plot) growth traits can be extracted from
  longitudinal data, including single time-point smoothed trait values and
  their growth rates, interval growth rates and other growth statistics, such
  as maximum growth. The package is particularly suited to preparing data from
  high-throughput phenotyping facilities, such as imaging data from a Lemna-Tec Scananalyzer
  (see <https://www.lemnatec.com/products/conveyor-scanalyzer/> for more
  information). The package 'growthPheno' can also be installed from
  <http://chris.brien.name/rpackages/>.
