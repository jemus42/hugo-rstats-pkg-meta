maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  A compendium of new geometries, coordinate systems, statistical
  transformations, scales and fonts for 'ggplot2', including splines, 1d and 2d densities,
  univariate average shifted histograms, a new map coordinate system based on the
  'PROJ.4'-library along with geom_cartogram() that mimics the original functionality of
  geom_map(), formatters for "bytes", a stat_stepribbon() function, increased 'plotly'
  compatibility and the 'StateFace' open source font 'ProPublica'. Further new
  functionality includes lollipop charts, dumbbell charts, the ability to encircle
  points and coordinate-system-based text annotations.
