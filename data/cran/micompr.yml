title: Multivariate Independent Comparison of Observations
maintainer: Nuno Fachada
description: |-
  A procedure for comparing multivariate samples associated with
  different groups. It uses principal component analysis to convert
  multivariate observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated statistical
  measures, which are then compared using a number of statistical methods. The
  procedure is independent of the distributional properties of samples and
  automatically selects features that best explain their differences, avoiding
  manual selection of specific points or summary statistics. It is appropriate
  for comparing samples of time series, images, spectrometric measures or
  similar multivariate observations.
