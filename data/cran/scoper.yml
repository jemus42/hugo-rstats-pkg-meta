title: Spectral Clustering-Based Method for Identifying B Cell Clones
maintainer: Jason Vander Heiden
description: |-
  Provides a computational framework for identification of B cell clones from
  Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data. Three main
  functions are included (identicalClones, hierarchicalClones, and spectralClones)
  that perform clustering among sequences of BCRs/IGs (B cell receptors/immunoglobulins)
  which share the same V gene, J gene and junction length.
