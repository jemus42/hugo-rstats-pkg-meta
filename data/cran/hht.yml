version: 2.1.3
title: 'The Hilbert-Huang Transform: Tools and Methods'
maintainer: Daniel C. Bowman
description: Builds on the EMD package to provide additional tools for empirical mode
  decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. It also implements the ensemble
  empirical decomposition (EEMD) and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition
  (CEEMD) methods to avoid mode mixing and intermittency problems found in EMD analysis.  The
  package comes with several plotting methods that can be used to view intrinsic mode
  functions, the HHT spectrum, and the Fourier spectrum.
