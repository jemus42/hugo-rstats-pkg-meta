maintainer: Wolfgang Lenhard
description: |-
  Conventional methods for producing standard scores in psychometrics or biometrics
  are often plagued with "jumps" or "gaps" (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables and low
  confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous norming method introduced by A.
  Lenhard et al. (2016, <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>; 2019, <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0222279>) and generates continuous test norm
  scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization samples, without requiring
  assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm scores are directly established
  from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile scores and an
  explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising from sampling and
  measurement error, while handling marked deviations from normality, addressing bottom
  or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of the variance in the original norm data
  sample.
