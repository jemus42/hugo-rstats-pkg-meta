description: 'Supervised, multivariate, and non-parametric discretization algorithm
  based on tree ensembles learning and moment matching optimization. This version
  of the algorithm relies on random forest algorithm to learn a large set of split
  points that conserves the relationship between attributes and the target class,
  and on moment matching optimization to transform this set into a reduced number
  of cut points matching as well as possible statistical properties of the initial
  set of split points. For each attribute to be discretized, the set S of its related
  split points extracted through random forest is mapped to a reduced set C of cut
  points of size k. This mapping relies on minimizing, for each continuous attribute
  to be discretized, the distance between the four first moments of S and the four
  first moments of C subject to some constraints. This non-linear optimization problem
  is performed using k values ranging from 2 to ''max_splits'', and the best solution
  returned correspond to the value k which optimum solution is the lowest one over
  the different realizations. ForestDisc is a generalization of RFDisc discretization
  method initially proposed by Berrado and Runger (2009) <doi:10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069327>,
  and improved by Berrado et al. in 2012 by adopting the idea of moment matching optimization
  related by Hoyland and Wallace (2001) <doi: 10.1287/mnsc.47.2.295.9834>.'
