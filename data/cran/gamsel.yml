title: Fit Regularization Path for Generalized Additive Models
maintainer: Trevor Hastie
description: Using overlap grouped-lasso penalties, 'gamsel' selects whether a term
  in a 'gam' is nonzero, linear, or a non-linear spline (up to a specified max df
  per variable). It fits the entire regularization path on a grid of values for the
  overall penalty lambda, both for gaussian and binomial families.
