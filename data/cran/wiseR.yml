description: A Shiny application for learning Bayesian Decision Networks from data.
  This package can be used for probabilistic reasoning (in the observational setting),
  causal inference (in the presence of interventions) and learning policy decisions
  (in Decision Network setting). Functionalities include end-to-end implementations
  for data-preprocessing, structure-learning, exact inference, approximate inference,
  extending the learned structure to Decision Networks and policy optimization using
  statistically rigorous methods such as bootstraps, resampling, ensemble-averaging
  and cross-validation. In addition to Bayesian Decision Networks, it also features
  correlation networks, community-detection, graph visualizations, graph exports and
  web-deployment of the learned models as Shiny dashboards.
