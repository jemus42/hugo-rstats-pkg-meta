version: 1.0.0
title: SparseStep Regression
maintainer: Gertjan van den Burg
description: |-
  Implements the SparseStep model for solving regression
  problems with a sparsity constraint on the parameters. The SparseStep
  regression model was proposed in Van den Burg, Groenen, and Alfons (2017)
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06967>. In the model, a regularization term is
  added to the regression problem which approximates the counting norm of
  the parameters.  By iteratively improving the approximation a sparse
  solution to the regression problem can be obtained.  In this package both
  the standard SparseStep algorithm is implemented as well as a path
  algorithm which uses golden section search to determine solutions with
  different values for the regularization parameter.
