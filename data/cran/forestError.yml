  A Unified Framework for Random Forest Prediction Error
  Estimation
maintainer: Benjamin Lu
description: |-
  Estimates the conditional error distributions of random forest
  predictions and common parameters of those distributions, including
  conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, and
  conditional quantiles, by out-of-bag weighting of out-of-bag prediction
  errors as proposed by Lu and Hardin (2019+) <arXiv:1912.07435>.
  This package is compatible with several existing packages that
  implement random forests in R.
