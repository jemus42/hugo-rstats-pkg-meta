title: Calculates Likelihood Support Intervals for Common Data Types
maintainer: Derek Smith
description: |-
  Calculates likelihood based support intervals for
  several common data types including binomial, Poisson, normal, lm(), and
  glm(). For the binomial, Poisson, and normal data likelihood intervals are
  calculated via root finding algorithm. Additional parameters allow the
  user to specify whether they would like to receive a parametric bootstrap
  estimate of the confidence level of said support interval. For lm() and glm(),
  the function returns profile likelihoods for each coefficient in the model.
