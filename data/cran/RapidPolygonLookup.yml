title: POLYGON LOOKUP USING KD TREES
maintainer: Markus Loecher
description: |-
  Facilitates efficient polygon search using kd trees.
  Coordinate level spatial data can be aggregated to higher geographical
  identities like census blocks, ZIP codes or police district boundaries.
  This process requires mapping each point in the given data set to a
  particular identity of the desired geographical hierarchy. Unless efficient
  data structures are used, this can be a daunting task. The operation
  point.in.polygon() from the package sp is computationally expensive.
  Here, we exploit kd-trees as efficient nearest neighbor search algorithm
  to dramatically reduce the effective number of polygons being searched.
