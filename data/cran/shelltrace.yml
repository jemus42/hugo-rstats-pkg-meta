title: Bivalve Growth and Trace Element Accumulation Model
maintainer: Niels J. de Winter
description: |2-

  Contains all the formulae of the growth and trace element uptake model described in the equally-named
  Geoscientific Model Development paper (de Winter, 2017, <doi:10.5194/gmd-2017-137>). The model takes as input a file with X- and Y-coordinates of digitized
  growth increments recognized on a longitudinal cross section through the bivalve shell, as well as a BMP file of an elemental map of the
  cross section surface with chemically distinct phases separated by phase analysis. It proceeds by a step-by-step process described in
  the paper, by which digitized growth increments are used to calculate changes in shell height, shell thickness, shell volume, shell mass
  and shell growth rate through the bivalve's life time. Then, results of this growth modelling are combined with the trace element mapping
  results to trace the incorporation of trace elements into the bivalve shell. Results of various modelling parameters can be exported in
  the form of XLSX files.
