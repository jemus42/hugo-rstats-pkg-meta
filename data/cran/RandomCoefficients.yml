title: Adaptive Estimation in the Linear Random Coefficients Models
maintainer: Christophe Gaillac
description: We implement adaptive estimation of the joint density linear model where
  the coefficients - intercept and slopes - are random and independent from regressors
  which support is a proper subset. The estimator proposed in Gaillac and Gautier
  (2019) <arXiv:1905.06584> is based on Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions which are
  computed  efficiently in 'RandomCoefficients'. This package also provides a parallel
  implementation of the estimator.
