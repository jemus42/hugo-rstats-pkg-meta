  An R-GUI for Spatial Analysis of Surface Runoff using the
  NRCS-CN Method
maintainer: Rafael Hernandez-Guzman
description: |-
  A Graphical user interface to calculate the rainfall-runoff relation using the Natural Resources Conservation Service - Curve Number method (NRCS-CN method) but include modifications by Hawkins et al., (2002) about the Initial Abstraction. This GUI follows the programming logic of a previously published software (Hernandez-Guzman et al., 2011)<doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.07.006>. It is a raster-based GIS tool that outputs runoff estimates from Land use/land cover and hydrologic soil group maps.
  This package is under development at the Institute about Natural Resources Research (INIRENA) from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo and represents a collaborative effort between the Hydro-Geomatic Lab (INIRENA) with the Environmental Management Lab (CIAD, A.C.).
