description: |-
  Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI).
  SCI is a transformation of (smoothed) climate (or environmental)
  time series that  removes seasonality and forces the data to
  take values of the standard normal distribution. SCI was
  originally developed for precipitation. In this case it is
  known as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
