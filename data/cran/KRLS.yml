title: Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares
maintainer: Jens Hainmueller
description: Package implements Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine
  learning method to fit multidimensional functions y=f(x) for regression and classification
  problems without relying on linearity or additivity assumptions. KRLS finds the
  best fitting function by minimizing the squared loss of a Tikhonov regularization
  problem, using Gaussian kernels as radial basis functions. For further details see
  Hainmueller and Hazlett (2014).
