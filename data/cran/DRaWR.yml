title: Discriminative Random Walk with Restart
maintainer: Charles Blatti
description: |-
  We present DRaWR, a network-based method for ranking genes or
  properties related to a given gene set. Such related genes or properties are
  identified from among the nodes of a large, heterogeneous network of biological
  information. Our method involves a random walk with restarts, performed on
  an initial network with multiple node and edge types, preserving more of the
  original, specific property information than current methods that operate
  on homogeneous networks. In this first stage of our algorithm, we find the
  properties that are the most relevant to the given gene set and extract a
  subnetwork of the original network, comprising only the relevant properties. We
  then rerank genes by their similarity to the given gene set, based on a second
  random walk with restarts, performed on the above subnetwork.
