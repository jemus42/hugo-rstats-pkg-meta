version: 0.6.1.3
title: Multi-Paradigm Pipeline Implementation
maintainer: Kun Ren
description: |-
  Provides various styles of function chaining methods: Pipe
  operator, Pipe object, and pipeline function, each representing a distinct
  pipeline model yet sharing almost a common set of features: A value can be
  piped to the first unnamed argument of a function and to dot symbol in an
  enclosed expression. The syntax is designed to make the pipeline more
  readable and friendly to a wide range of operations.
