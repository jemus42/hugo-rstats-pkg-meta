  SCORER 2.0: an algorithm for distinguishing parallel dimeric and
  trimeric coiled-coil sequences
maintainer: Thomas L. Vincent
description: This package contains the functions necessary to run the SCORER 2.0 algorithm.
  SCORER 2.0 can be used to differentiate between parallel dimeric and trimeric coiled-coil
  sequence, which are the two most more frequent coiled-coil structures observed naturally.
  As such, SCORER 2.0 is particularly useful for researchers looking to characterize
  novel coiled-coil sequences. It may also be used to assist in the structural characterization
  of synthetic coiled-coil sequences. Also included in this package are functions
  that allows the user to retrain the SCORER 2.0 algorithm using user-defined training
  data.
