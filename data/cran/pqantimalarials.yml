  web tool for estimating under-five deaths caused by poor-quality
  antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa
maintainer: J. Patrick Renschler
description: |-
  This package allows users to calculate the number of
  under-five child deaths caused by consumption of poor quality
  antimalarials across 39 sub-Saharan nations. The package supports one
  function, that starts an interactive web tool created using
  the shiny R package. The web tool runs locally on the user's machine.
  The web tool allows users to set input parameters (prevalence of poor
  quality antimalarials, case fatality rate of children who take poor
  quality antimalarials, and sample size) which are then used to perform
  an uncertainty analysis following the Latin hypercube
  sampling scheme. Users can download the output figures as PDFs, and the
  output data as CSVs. Users can also download their input parameters
  for reference. This package was designed to accompany the analysis
  presented in:

  "Estimated under-five deaths associated with poor-quality
  antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa", 2014. Paper submitted.
