title: Imputation of Count Data using Side Information
maintainer: Genevieve Robin
description: Analysis, imputation, and multiple imputation of count data using covariates.
  LORI uses a log-linear model where main row and column effects are decomposed as
  regression terms on known covariates. A residual low-rank interaction term is also
  fitted. LORI returns estimates of covariate effects and interactions, as well as
  an imputed count table. The package also contains a multiple imputation procedure.
