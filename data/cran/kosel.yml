title: Variable Selection by Revisited Knockoffs Procedures
maintainer: Clemence Karmann
description: 'Performs variable selection for many types of L1-regularised regressions
  using the revisited knockoffs procedure. This procedure uses a matrix of knockoffs
  of the covariates independent from the response variable Y. The idea is to determine
  if a covariate belongs to the model depending on whether it enters the model before
  or after its knockoff. The procedure suits for a wide range of regressions with
  various types of response variables. Regression models available are exported from
  the R packages ''glmnet'' and ''ordinalNet''. Based on the paper linked to via the
