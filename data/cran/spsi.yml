title: Shape-Preserving Uni-Variate and Bi-Variate Spline Interpolation
maintainer: Szymon Sacher
description: Program uses method of polynomial of variable degrees to interpolate
  gridded data preserving monotonicity and/or convexity or none. Method is implemented
  for univariate and bivariate cases. If values of derivatives are provided, spline
  will fix them,if not program will estimate them numerically. Package written purely
  in R.
