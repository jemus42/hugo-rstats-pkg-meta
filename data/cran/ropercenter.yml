title: Reproducible Data Retrieval from the Roper Center Data Archive
maintainer: Frederick Solt
description: |-
  Reproducible, programmatic retrieval of datasets from the
  Roper Center data archive.  The Roper Center for Public Opinion
  Research <https://ropercenter.cornell.edu> maintains the largest
  archive of public opinion data in existence, but researchers using
  these datasets are caught in a bind.  The Center's terms and conditions
  bar redistribution of downloaded datasets, but to ensure that one's
  work can be reproduced, assessed, and built upon by others, one must
  provide access to the raw data one employed.  The `ropercenter`
  package cuts this knot by providing registered users with programmatic,
  reproducible access to Roper Center datasets from within R.
