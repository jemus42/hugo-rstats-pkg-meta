title: Analysis of Illumina BeadArray SNP data including MSV markers
maintainer: Lars Gidskehaug
description: Imports bead-summary data from Illumina scanner.<U+000a>Pre-processes
  using a suite of optional normalizations and<U+000a>transformations. Clusters and
  automatically calls genotypes,<U+000a>critically able to handle markers in duplicated
  regions of the<U+000a>genome (multisite variants; MSVs). Interactive clustering
  if<U+000a>needed. MSVs with variation in both paralogs may be resolved<U+000a>and
  mapped to their respective chromosomes. Quality control<U+000a>including pedigree
  checking and visual assessment of clusters.<U+000a>Too large data-sets are handled
  by working on smaller subsets<U+000a>of the data in sequence.
