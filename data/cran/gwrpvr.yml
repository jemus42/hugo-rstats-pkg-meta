title: Genome-Wide Regression P-Value (Gwrpv)
maintainer: Michael O'Neill
description: |-
  Computes the sample probability value (p-value)
  for the estimated coefficient from a standard
  genome-wide univariate regression.  It computes the exact
  finite-sample p-value under the assumption that the measured
  phenotype (the dependent variable in the regression) has
  a known Bernoulli-normal mixture distribution.
  Finite-sample genome-wide regression p-values (Gwrpv) with
  a non-normally distributed phenotype (Gregory Connor and
  Michael O'Neill, bioRxiv 204727 <doi:10.1101/204727>).
