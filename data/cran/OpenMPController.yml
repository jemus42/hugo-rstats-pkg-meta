title: Control Number of OpenMP Threads Dynamically
maintainer: Simon Guest
description: |-
  The OpenMPController package provides a function omp_set_num_threads()
  to set the number of OpenMP threads to be used.
  This may be useful, for example, when linking against a vendor
  optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math
  Library), since the defaults used by those libraries may not
  be highly performant.
