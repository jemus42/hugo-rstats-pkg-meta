title: Calculate and Rectify Moran's I
maintainer: Ivan Fuentes
description: Provides a scaling method to obtain a standardized Moran's I measure.
  Moran's I is a measure for the spatial autocorrelation of a data set, it gives a
  measure of similarity between data and its surrounding. The range of this value
  must be [-1,1], but this does not happen in practice. This package scale the Moran's
  I value and map it into the theoretical range of [-1,1]. Once the Moran's I value
  is rescaled, it facilitates the comparison between projects, for instance, a researcher
  can calculate Moran's I in a city in China, with a sample size of n1 and area of
  interest a1. Another researcher runs a similar experiment in a city in Mexico with
  different sample size, n2, and an area of interest a2. Due to the differences between
  the conditions, it is not possible to compare Moran's I in a straightforward way.
  In this version of the package, the spatial autocorrelation Moran's I is calculated
  as proposed in Chen(2013) <arXiv:1606.03658>.
