title: Inference in Regressions with Shift-Share Structure
maintainer: Michal Kolesár
description: |-
  Provides confidence intervals in least-squares regressions when the
  variable of interest has a shift-share structure, and in instrumental
  variables regressions when the instrument has a shift-share structure. The
  confidence intervals implement the AKM and AKM0 methods developed in Adão,
  Kolesár, and Morales (2019) <doi:10.1093/qje/qjz025>.
