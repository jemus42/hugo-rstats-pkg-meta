title: Thermoluminescence Glow Curve Deconvolution
maintainer: Jun Peng
description: |-
  Deconvolving thermoluminescence glow curves according to various
  kinetic models (first-order, second-order, general-order, and mixed-order) using
  a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (More, 1978) <DOI:10.1007/BFb0067700>.
  It provides the possibility of setting constraints or fixing any of parameters.
  It offers an interactive way to initialize parameters by clicking with a mouse on
  a plot at positions where peak maxima should be located. The optimal estimate is
  obtained by "trial-and-error". It also provides routines for simulating first-order,
  second-order, and general-order glow peaks.
