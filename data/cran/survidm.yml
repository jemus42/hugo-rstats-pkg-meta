title: Inference and Prediction in an Illness-Death Model
maintainer: Marta Sestelo
description: |-
  Newly developed methods for the estimation of several probabilities
  in an illness-death model. The package can be used to obtain nonparametric and
  semiparametric estimates for: transition probabilities, occupation probabilities,
  cumulative incidence function and the sojourn time distributions.
  Additionally, it is possible to fit proportional hazards regression models
  in each transition of the Illness-Death Model. Several auxiliary
  functions are also provided which can be used for marginal
  estimation of the survival functions.
