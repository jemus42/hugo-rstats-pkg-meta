title: R Functions for Elementary Statistics
maintainer: Homer White
description: |-
  A collection of data sets and functions that are useful in the
  teaching of statistics at an elementary level to students who may have
  little or no previous experience with the command line.  The functions for
  elementary inferential procedures follow a uniform interface for user
  input.  Some of the functions are instructional applets that can only be
  run on the R Studio integrated development environment with package
  'manipulate' installed.  Other instructional applets are Shiny apps
  that may be run locally. In teaching the package is used alongside of
  package 'mosaic', 'mosaicData' and 'abd', which are therefore listed as
  dependencies.
