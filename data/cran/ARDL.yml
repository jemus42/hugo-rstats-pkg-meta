title: ARDL, ECM and Bounds-Test for Cointegration
maintainer: Kleanthis Natsiopoulos
description: |-
  Creates complex autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models
  providing just the order and automatically constructs the underlying
  unrestricted and restricted error correction model (ECM). It also performs
  the bounds-test for cointegration as described in Pesaran et al. (2001) <doi:10.1002/jae.616> and provides the multipliers and the cointegrating
  equation.
