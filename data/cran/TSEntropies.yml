title: Time Series Entropies
maintainer: Jiri Tomcala
description: Computes various entropies of given time series. This is the initial
  version that includes ApEn() and SampEn() functions for calculating approximate
  entropy and sample entropy. Approximate entropy was proposed by S.M. Pincus in "Approximate
  entropy as a measure of system complexity", Proceedings of the National Academy
  of Sciences of the United States of America, 88, 2297-2301 (March 1991). Sample
  entropy was proposed by J. S. Richman and J. R. Moorman in "Physiological time-series
  analysis using approximate entropy and sample entropy", American Journal of Physiology,
  Heart and Circulatory Physiology, 278, 2039-2049 (June 2000). This package also
  contains FastApEn() and FastSampEn() functions for calculating fast approximate
  entropy and fast sample entropy. These are newly designed very fast algorithms,
  resulting from the modification of the original algorithms. The calculated values
  of these entropies are not the same as the original ones, but the entropy trend
  of the analyzed time series determines equally reliably. Their main advantage is
  their speed, which is up to a thousand times higher. A scientific article describing
  their properties has been submitted to The Journal of Supercomputing and in present
  time it is waiting for the acceptance.
