title: Documents Files
maintainer: Zachary Colburn
description: It is sometimes necessary to create documentation for all files in a
  directory. Doing so by hand can be very tedious. This task is made fast and reproducible
  using the functionality of 'documenter'. It aggregates all text files in a directory
  and its subdirectories into a single word document in a semi-automated fashion.
