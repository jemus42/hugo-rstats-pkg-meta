title: High Dimensional Numerical and Symbolic Calculus
maintainer: Emanuele Guidotti
description: 'Efficient C++ optimized functions for numerical and symbolic calculus.
  It includes basic symbolic arithmetic, tensor calculus, Einstein summing convention,
  fast computation of the Levi-Civita symbol and generalized Kronecker delta, Taylor
  series expansion, multivariate Hermite polynomials, accurate high-order derivatives,
  differential operators (Gradient, Jacobian, Hessian, Divergence, Curl, Laplacian)
  and numerical integration in arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems: cartesian,
  polar, spherical, cylindrical, parabolic or user defined by custom scale factors.'
