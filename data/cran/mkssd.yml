title: Efficient multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs
maintainer: B N Mandal
description: |-
  mkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced
  non-aliased multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by
  interchanging the elements of the generator vector. The package
  tries to generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare
  efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The
  package also displays the progress of generation of an
  efficient multi-level k-circulant design through a progress
  bar. The progress of 100% means that one full round of
  interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically
  4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs.
