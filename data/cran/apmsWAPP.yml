title: Pre- and Postprocessing for AP-MS data analysis based on<U+000a>spectral counts
maintainer: Martina Fischer
description: 'apmsWAPP provides a complete workflow for the analysis of AP-MS data
  (replicate single-bait purifications including negative controls) based on spectral
  counts.<U+000a>It comprises pre-processing, scoring and postprocessing of protein
  interactions.<U+000a>A final list of interaction candidates is reported: it provides
  a ranking of the candidates according<U+000a>to their p-values which allow estimating
  the number of false-positive interactions.'
