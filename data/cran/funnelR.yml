title: Funnel Plots for Proportion Data
maintainer: Matthew Kumar
description: A set of simplified functions for creating funnel plots for proportion
  data. This package supports user defined benchmarks, confidence limits and estimation
  methods (i.e. exact or approximate) based on Spiegelhalter (2005) <doi:10.1002/sim.1970>.
  Additional routines for returning scored unit level data according to a set of specifications
  is also implemented for convenience. Specifically, both a categorical and a continuous
  score variable is returned to the sample data frame, which identifies which observations
  are deemed extreme or in control. Typically, such variables are useful as stratifications
  or covariates in further exploratory analyses. Lastly, the plotting routine returns
  a base funnel plot ('ggplot2'), which can also be tailored.
