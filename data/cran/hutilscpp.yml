version: 0.3.0
title: Miscellaneous Functions in C++
maintainer: Hugh Parsonage
description: |-
  Provides utility functions that are simply, frequently used,
  but may require higher performance that what can be obtained from base R.
  Incidentally provides support for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point
  with its nearest neighbour in another array. Used as a complement to package
  'hutils' by sacrificing compilation or installation time for higher running
  speeds. The name is a portmanteau of the author and 'Rcpp'.
