title: Analysing and plotting genotype-phenotype maps
maintainer: Arne B. Gjuvsland
description: 'This package contains tools for studying genotype-phenotype (GP) maps
  for bi-allelic loci underlying quantitative phenotypes. The 0.1 version is released
  in connection with the publication of Gjuvsland et al. (2003) and implements basic
  line plots and the monotonicity measures for GP maps presented in the paper. Reference:
