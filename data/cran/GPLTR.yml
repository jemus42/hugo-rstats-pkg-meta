title: Generalized Partially Linear Tree-Based Regression Model
maintainer: Cyprien Mbogning
description: |-
  Combining a generalized linear model with an additional tree part
  on the same scale. A four-step procedure is proposed to fit the model and test
  the joint effect of the selected tree part while adjusting on confounding factors.
  We also proposed an ensemble procedure based on the bagging to improve prediction
  accuracy and computed several scores of importance for variable selection.
