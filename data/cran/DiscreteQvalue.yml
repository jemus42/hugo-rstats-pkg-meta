title: Improved q-Values for Discrete Uniform and Homogeneous Tests
maintainer: Marta Cousido Rocha
description: We consider a multiple testing procedure used in many modern applications
  which is the q-value method proposed by Storey and Tibshirani (2003), <doi:10.1073/pnas.1530509100>.
  The q-value method is based on the false discovery rate (FDR), hence versions of
  the q-value method can be defined depending on which estimator of the proportion
  of true null hypotheses, p0, is plugged in the FDR estimator. We implement the q-value
  method based on two classical pi0 estimators, and furthermore, we propose and implement
  three versions of the q-value method for homogeneous discrete uniform P-values based
  on pi0 estimators which take into account the discrete distribution of the P-values.
