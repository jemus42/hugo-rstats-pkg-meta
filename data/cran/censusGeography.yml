maintainer: Jacob Kaplan
description: |-
  Converts the United States Census geographic code for city, state (FIP and ICP),
  region, and birthplace, into the name of the region. e.g. takes an input of
  Census city code 5330 to it's actual city, Philadelphia. Will return NA for code
  that doesn't correspond to real location.
