title: Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution
maintainer: Emmanuel Paradis
description: Functions for reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic
  trees, analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic framework, ancestral character
  analyses, analyses of diversification and macroevolution, computing distances from
  DNA sequences, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as importing from
  BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's test, generalized skyline plots,
  graphical exploration of phylogenetic data (alex, trex, kronoviz), estimation of
  absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like trees using mean path lengths and penalized
  likelihood, dating trees with non-contemporaneous sequences, translating DNA into
  AA sequences, and assessing sequence alignments. Phylogeny estimation can be done
  with the NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods handling
  incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the corresponding triangle
  method). Some functions call external applications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle)
  whose results are returned into R.
