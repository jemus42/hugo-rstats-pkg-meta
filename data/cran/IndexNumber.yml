maintainer: Alejandro Saavedra-Nieves
description: We provide an R tool to determine index numbers. It is a measure of the
  evolution of a fixed magnitude for only a product of for several products. It is
  very useful in Social Sciences. Among others, we obtain simple index numbers (in
  chain or in serie), index numbers for not only a product or weighted index numbers
  as the Laspeyres index (Laspeyres, 1864), the Paasche index (Paasche, 1874) or the
  Fisher index (Lapedes, 1978).
