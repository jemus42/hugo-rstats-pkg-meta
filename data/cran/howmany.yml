title: A lower bound for the number of correct rejections
maintainer: Nicolai Meinshausen
description: |-
  When testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, this
  package provides functionality to calculate a lower bound for
  the number of correct rejections (as a function of the number
  of rejected hypotheses), which holds simultaneously -with high
  probability- for all possible number of rejections.  As a
  special case, a lower bound for the total number of false null
  hypotheses can be inferred.  Dependent test statistics can be
  handled for multiple tests of associations. For independent
  test statistics, it is sufficient to provide a list of
  p-values.
