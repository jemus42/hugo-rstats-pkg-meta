title: Local Log-linear Models for Capture-Recapture
maintainer: Zach Kurtz
description: |-
  Applies local log-linear capture-recapture models (LLLMs) for
  closed populations, as described in the doctoral thesis of Zachary Kurtz.
  The method is relevant when there are 3-5 capture occasions, with auxiliary
  covariates available for all capture occasions.  As part of estimating the
  number of missing population units, the method estimates the "rate of
  missingness" as it varies over the covariate space.  In addition,
  user-friendly functions are provided to recreate (approximately) the method
  of Zwane and van der Heijden (2004), which applied the VGAM package
  in a way that is closely related to LLLMs.
