description: A collection of functions to support matrix calculations<U+000a>for probability,
  econometric and numerical analysis. There are<U+000a>additional functions that are
  comparable to APL functions which<U+000a>are useful for actuarial models such as
  pension mathematics.<U+000a>This package is used for teaching and research purposes
  at the<U+000a>Department of Finance and Risk Engineering, New York<U+000a>University,
