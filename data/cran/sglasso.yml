title: Lasso Method for RCON(V,E) Models
maintainer: Luigi Augugliaro
description: RCON(V, E) models are a kind of restriction of the Gaussian Graphical
  Models defined by a set of equality constraints on the entries of the concentration
  matrix. 'sglasso' package implements the structured graphical lasso (sglasso) estimator
  proposed in Abbruzzo et al. (2014) for the weighted l1-penalized RCON(V, E) model.
  Two cyclic coordinate algorithms are implemented to compute the sglasso estimator,
  i.e. a cyclic coordinate minimization (CCM) and a cyclic coordinate descent (CCD)
  algorithm.
