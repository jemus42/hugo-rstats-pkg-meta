title: Calculate Crosstab and Topline Tables of Weighted Survey Data
maintainer: John D. Johnson
description: |-
  Calculate common types of tables for weighted survey data.
  Options include topline and (2-way and 3-way) crosstab tables of
  categorical or ordinal data as well as summary tables of weighted
  numeric variables. Optionally, include the margin of error at
  selected confidence intervals including the design effect. The
  design effect is calculated as described by
  Kish (1965) <doi:10.1002/bimj.19680100122> beginning
  on page 257. Output takes the form of tibbles (simple data frames).
  This package conveniently handles labelled data, such as that
  commonly used by 'Stata' and 'SPSS.' Complex survey design is
  not supported at this time.
