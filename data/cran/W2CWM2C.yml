  A Graphical Tool for Wavelet (Cross) Correlation and Wavelet
  Multiple (Cross) Correlation Analysis
maintainer: Josue M. Polanco-Martinez
description: 'Set of functions that improves the graphical presentations of the functions
  ''wave.correlation'' and ''spin.correlation'' (waveslim package, Whitcher 2012)
  and the ''wave.multiple.correlation'' and ''wave.multiple.cross.correlation'' (wavemulcor
  package, Fernandez-Macho 2012b). The plot outputs (heatmaps) can be displayed in
  the screen or can be saved as PNG or JPG images or as PDF or EPS formats. The W2CWM2C
  package also helps to handle the (input data) multivariate time series easily as
  a list of N elements (times series) and provides a multivariate data set (dataexample)
  to exemplify its use. A description of the package was published in Computing in
  Science & Engineering (Volume:16, Issue: 6) on Sep. 09, 2014, doi:10.1109/MCSE.2014.96.'
