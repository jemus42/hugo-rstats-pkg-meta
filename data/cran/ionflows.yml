  Calculate the Number of Required Flows for Semiconductor
  Sequencing
maintainer: Michael Bockmayr
description: 'Two methods for calculation of the number of required flows for semiconductor
  sequencing: 1. Using a simulation, the number of flows can be calculated for a concrete
  list of amplicons. 2. An exact combinatorial model is evaluated to calculate the
  number of flows for a random ensemble of sequences.'
