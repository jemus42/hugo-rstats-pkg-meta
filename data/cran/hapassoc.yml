  Inference of Trait Associations with SNP Haplotypes and Other
  Attributes using the EM Algorithm
maintainer: K. Burkett
description: |-
  The following R functions are used for inference of trait
  associations with haplotypes and other covariates in
  generalized linear models.  The functions are developed
  primarily for data collected in cohort or cross-sectional
  studies. They can accommodate uncertain haplotype phase and
  handle missing genotypes at some SNPs.
