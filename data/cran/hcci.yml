  Interval estimation for the parameters of linear models with
  heteroskedasticity (Wild Bootstrap)
maintainer: Pedro Rafael Diniz Marinho
description: |-
  This package calculates the interval estimates for the parameters of
  linear models heteroscedastic regression using bootstrap - (Wild Bootstrap) and double
  bootstrap-t (Wild Bootstrap). It is also possible to calculate confidence intervals using
  the percentile bootstrap and percentile bootstrap double. It is possible to calculate
  consistent estimates of the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear regression models
  with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. The package also provides function to calculate
  consistently the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear models with heteroskedasticity
  of unknown form.
