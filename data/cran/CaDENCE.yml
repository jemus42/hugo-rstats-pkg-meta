  Conditional Density Estimation Network Construction and
  Evaluation
maintainer: Alex J. Cannon
description: Parameters of a user-specified probability distribution are modelled
  by a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network. This framework can be used
  to implement probabilistic nonlinear models including mixture density networks,
  heteroscedastic regression models, zero-inflated models, etc. following Cannon (2012)
