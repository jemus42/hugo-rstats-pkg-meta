title: Bayesian Framework for Computational Modeling
maintainer: Ã˜ystein Olav Skaar
description: |-
  Derived from the work of Kruschke (2015, <ISBN:9780124058880>),
  the present package aims to provide a framework for conducting Bayesian
  analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling utilizing the
  Just Another Gibbs Sampler ('JAGS', Plummer, 2003, <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>).
  The initial version includes several modules for conducting Bayesian
  equivalents of chi-squared tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA),
  multiple (hierarchical) regression, softmax regression, and for fitting data
  (e.g., structural equation modeling).
