title: Fast, Low Memory-Footprint Digests of R Objects
maintainer: Gabriel Becker
description: |-
  Provides an R interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming,
  non-cryptographic 'SpookyHash' hash algorithm for use in digest-based
  comparisons of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs directly into R's internal
  serialization machinery, allowing digests of all R objects the serialize()
  function supports, including reference-style objects via custom hooks. Speed is
  high and scales linearly by object size; memory usage is constant and
  negligible.
