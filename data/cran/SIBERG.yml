  Systematic Identification of Bimodally Expressed Genes Using
  RNAseq Data
maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes
description: |-
  Provides models to identify bimodally expressed genes from
  RNAseq data based on the Bimodality Index. SIBERG models the  RNAseq data in
  the finite mixture modeling framework and incorporates mechanisms  for
  dealing with RNAseq normalization. Three types of mixture models are
  implemented,  namely, the mixture of log normal, negative binomial, or
  generalized Poisson distribution. See Tong et al. (2013)
