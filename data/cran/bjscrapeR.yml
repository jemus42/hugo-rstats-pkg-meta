version: 0.1.0
title: An API Wrapper for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
maintainer: Dylan McDowell
description: Drawing heavy influence from 'blscrapeR', this package scrapes crime
  data from <https://www.bjs.gov/>. Specifically, it scrapes data from the National
  Crime Victimization Survey which tracks personal and household crime in the USA.
  The idea is to utilize the 'tidyverse' methodology to create an efficient work flow
  when dealing with crime statistics.
