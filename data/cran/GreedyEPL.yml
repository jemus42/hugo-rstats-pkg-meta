title: Greedy Expected Posterior Loss
maintainer: Riccardo Rastelli
description: Summarises a collection of partitions into a single optimal partition.
  The objective function is the expected posterior loss, and the minimisation is performed
  through a greedy algorithm described in Rastelli, R. and Friel, N. (2016) "Optimal
  Bayesian estimators for latent variable cluster models" <arXiv:1607.02325>.
