title: Moving Subset Analysis FACE
maintainer: Lukas W. Lehnert
description: The new methodology "moving subset analysis" provides functions to investigate
  the effect of environmental conditions on the CO2 fertilization effect within longterm
  free air carbon enrichment (FACE)  experiments. In general, the functionality is
  applicable to derive the influence of a third variable (forcing experiment-support
  variable) on the relation between a dependent and an independent variable.
