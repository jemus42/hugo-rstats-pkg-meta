  Construction of Genetic Maps in Experimental Crosses: Full-Sib,
  RILs, F2 and Backcrosses
maintainer: Cristiane Taniguti
description: |-
  Analysis of molecular marker data from model (backcrosses,
  F2 and recombinant inbred lines) and non-model systems (i. e.
  outcrossing species). For the later, it allows statistical
  analysis by simultaneously estimating linkage and linkage
  phases (genetic map construction) according to Wu et al. (2002)
  <doi:10.1006/tpbi.2002.1577>. All analysis are based on multipoint
  approaches using hidden Markov models.
