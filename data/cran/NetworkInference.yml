title: Inferring Latent Diffusion Networks
maintainer: Fridolin Linder
description: This is an R implementation of the netinf algorithm (Gomez Rodriguez,
  Leskovec, and Krause, 2010)<doi:10.1145/1835804.1835933>. Given a set of events
  that spread between a set of nodes the algorithm infers the most likely stable diffusion
  network that is underlying the diffusion process.
