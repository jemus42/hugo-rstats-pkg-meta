  Preprocess Data and Get Better Insights from Machine Learning
  Models
maintainer: Simon Corde
description: |-
  The main focus is on preprocessing and data visualization of machine learning models performances.
  Some functions allow to fill in gaps in time series using linear interpolation on panel data, some functions
  permit to draw lift effect and lift curve in order to benchmark machine learning models or you can even find
  the optimal number of clusters in agglomerative clustering algorithm.
