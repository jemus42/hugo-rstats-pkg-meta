title: Robust Linear Regression with Compositional Data as Covariates
maintainer: David Kepplinger
description: |-
  Robust regression methods for compositional data.
  The distribution of the estimates can be approximated with various bootstrap
  methods. These bootstrap methods are available for the compositional as well
  as for standard robust regression estimates. This allows for direct
