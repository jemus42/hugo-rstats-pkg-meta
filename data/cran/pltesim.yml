  Simulate Probabilistic Long-Term Effects in Models with Temporal
  Dependence
maintainer: Christopher Gandrud
description: |-
  Calculates and depicts probabilistic long-term effects
  in binary models with temporal dependence variables. The package performs
  two tasks. First, it calculates the change in the probability of the event
  occurring given a change in a theoretical variable. Second, it calculates
  the rolling difference in the future probability of the event for two
  scenarios: one where the event occurred at a given time and one where the
  event does not occur. The package is consistent with the recent movement to
  depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of interest with the
  requisite measures of uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for
  researchers to interpret short- and long-term effects of explanatory
  variables in binary autoregressive models, which can have important
  implications for the correct interpretation of these models.
