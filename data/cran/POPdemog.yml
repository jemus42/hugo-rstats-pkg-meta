maintainer: Ying Zhou
description: 'Plot demographic graphs for single/multiple populations from coalescent
  simulation program input. Currently, this package can support the ''ms'', ''msHot'',
  ''MaCS'', ''msprime'', ''SCRM'', and ''Cosi2'' simulation programs. It does not
  check the simulation program input for correctness, but assumes the simulation program
  input has been validated by the simulation program. More features will be added
  to this package in the future, please check the ''GitHub'' page for the latest updates:
