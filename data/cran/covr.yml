title: Test Coverage for Packages
maintainer: Jim Hester
description: |-
  Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally)
  upload the results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' <http://codecov.io> or
  'Coveralls' <http://coveralls.io>. Code coverage is a measure of the amount of
  code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test
  quality and completeness. This package is compatible with any testing
  methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled
  C/C++/FORTRAN code.
