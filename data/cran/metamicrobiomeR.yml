  Inflated Beta GAMLSS and Meta-Analysis Across Studies using
  Random Effects Model
maintainer: Nhan Ho
description: |-
  Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS)
  with zero inflated beta (BEZI) family for analysis of microbiome relative abundance data
  (with various options for data transformation/normalization to address compositional effects) and
  random effects meta-analysis models for meta-analysis pooling estimates across microbiome studies
  are implemented.
  Random Forest model to predict microbiome age based on relative abundances of
  shared bacterial genera with the Bangladesh data (Subramanian et al 2014),
  comparison of multiple diversity indexes using linear/linear mixed effect models
  and some data display/visualization are also implemented.
