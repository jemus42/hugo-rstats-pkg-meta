title: TBF Methodology Extension for Multinomial Outcomes
maintainer: Rachel Heyard
description: Extends the test-based Bayes factor (TBF) methodology to multinomial
  regression models and discrete time-to-event models with competing risks. The TBF
  methodology has been well developed and implemented for the generalised linear model
  [Held et al. (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-STS510>] and for the Cox model [Held et al.
  (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.7089>].
