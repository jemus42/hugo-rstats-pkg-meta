title: Create Muller Plots of Evolutionary Dynamics
maintainer: Robert Noble
description: |-
  Create plots that combine a phylogeny and frequency dynamics.
  Phylogenetic input can be a generic adjacency matrix or a tree of class "phylo".
  Inspired by similar plots in publications of the labs of RE Lenski and JE
  Barrick. Named for HJ Muller (who popularised such plots) and H Wickham (whose
  code this package exploits).
