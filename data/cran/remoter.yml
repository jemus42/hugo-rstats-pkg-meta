title: 'Remote R: Control a Remote R Session from a Local One'
maintainer: Drew Schmidt
description: |-
  A set of utilities for client/server computing with R, controlling
  a remote R session (the server) from a local one (the client).  Simply set
  up a server (see package vignette for more details) and connect to it from
  your local R session ('RStudio', terminal, etc).  The client/server
  framework is a custom 'REPL' and runs entirely in your R session without the
  need for installing a custom environment on your system.  Network
  communication is handled by the 'ZeroMQ' library by way of the 'pbdZMQ'
  package.
