title: Raster Image Processing and Vector Recognition
maintainer: Andy Bosyi
description: |-
  If there is a need to recognise edges on a raster image or a bitmap or any kind of a matrix, one can find packages
  that does only 90 degrees vectorization. Typically the nature of artefact images is linear and can be vectorized in much more
  efficient way than draw a series of 90 degrees lines. The fasteraster package does recognition of lines using only one pass.
  It also allows to calculate mass and the mass centers for the recognized zones or polygons.
