title: Teaching Data for Statistics and Data Science
maintainer: Christopher Prener
description: |-
  Provides data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses.
  It includes a sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous
  coinflip experiment. These are data that I use for teaching SOC 4015 / SOC
  5050 at Saint Louis University (SLU). The package also contains an R Markdown
  template with the required formatting for assignments in my courses
  SOC 4015, SOC 4650, SOC 5050, and SOC 5650 at SLU.
