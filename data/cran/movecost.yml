  Calculation of Accumulated Cost Surface and Least-Cost Paths
  Related to Human Movement Across the Landscape
maintainer: Gianmarco Alberti
description: Provides the facility to calculate non-isotropic accumulated cost surface
  and least-cost paths using a number of human-movement-related cost functions that
  can be selected by the user. It just requires a Digital Terrain Model, a start location
  and (optionally) destination locations. See Alberti (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.softx.2019.100331>.
