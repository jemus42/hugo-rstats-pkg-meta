title: Conjoint Analysis through Averaging of Multiple Analyses
maintainer: William Hughes
description: |-
  The package aids in creating a Conjoint Analysis design
  with extra cards.  Unlike traditional "holdout" cards these
  cards are used to create a set of "good" (balanced and low
  correlation) designs. Each of these designs is analyzed and the
  average calculated.
