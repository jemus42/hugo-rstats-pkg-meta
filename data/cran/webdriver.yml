title: '''WebDriver'' Client for ''PhantomJS'''
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  A client for the 'WebDriver' 'API'. It allows driving a
  (probably headless) web browser, and can be used to test web
  applications, including 'Shiny' apps. In theory it works with any
  'WebDriver' implementation, but it was only tested with 'PhantomJS'.
