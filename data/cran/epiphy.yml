title: Analysis of Plant Disease Epidemics
maintainer: Christophe Gigot
description: |-
  A toolbox to make it easy to analyze plant disease epidemics. It
  provides a common framework for plant disease intensity data recorded over
  time and/or space. Implemented statistical methods are currently mainly
  focused on spatial pattern analysis (e.g., aggregation indices, Taylor and
  binary power laws, distribution fitting, SADIE and mapcomp methods). See
  Madden LV, Hughes G, van den Bosch F (2007, ISBN: 978-089054-354-2) for
  further information on these methods. Several data sets that were mainly
  published in plant disease epidemiology literature are also included in this
  package.
