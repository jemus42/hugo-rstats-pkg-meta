title: Stochastic Hybrid Models in Dynamic Networks
maintainer: Fernando S. Marques
description: |-
  Simulates stochastic hybrid models for transmission of infectious
  diseases in dynamic networks. It is a metapopulation model in which each
  node in the network is a sub-population and disease spreads within nodes
  and among them, combining two approaches: stochastic simulation algorithm
  or its approximations (Gillespie DT (2007)
  <doi:10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104637>) and individual-based
  approach, respectively. Movement among nodes are data based and can be
  irregular. Equations that models spread within nodes are customizable and
  there are two link types among nodes: migration and influence (commuting).
