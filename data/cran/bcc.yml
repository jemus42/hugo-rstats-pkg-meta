maintainer: Daniel Cerqueira
description: 'Applies beta control charts to defined values, using ''qcc'' package
  with new beta control limits. The Beta Chart presents the control limits based on
  the Beta probability distribution. Can be used for monitoring fraction data from
  Binomial distribution as replacement of the p-Charts. The Beta Chart was applied
  for monitoring the variables in three real studies, and it was compared to the control
  limits with three schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i) Beta approximation
  to the Binomial distribution was more appropriate with values confined in the [0,
  1]- interval; and (ii) the charts proposed were more sensitive to the average run
  length (ARL), in both in-control and out-of-control processes monitoring. The Beta
  Charts outperform the Shewhart control charts analyzed for monitoring fraction data.
