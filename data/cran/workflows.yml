title: Modeling Workflows
maintainer: Davis Vaughan
description: |-
  Managing both a 'parsnip' model and a preprocessor, such as a
  model formula or recipe from 'recipes', can often be challenging. The goal
  of 'workflows' is to streamline this process by bundling the model alongside
  the preprocessor, all within the same object.
