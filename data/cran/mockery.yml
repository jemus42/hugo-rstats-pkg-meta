title: Mocking Library for R
maintainer: Jim Hester
description: |2-

  The two main functionalities of this package are creating mock
  objects (functions) and selectively intercepting calls to a given
  function that originate in some other function. It can be used
  with any testing framework available for R. Mock objects can
  be injected with either this package's own stub() function or a
  similar with_mock() facility present in the 'testthat' package.
