title: Weighted Estimation in Cox Regression
maintainer: Georg Heinze
description: |-
  Implements weighted estimation in Cox regression as proposed by
  Schemper, Wakounig and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009,
  <doi:10.1002/sim.3623>) and as described in Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and
  Heinze (Journal of Statistical Software, 2018, <doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i02>).
  Weighted Cox regression provides unbiased average hazard ratio
  estimates also in case of non-proportional hazards.
  Approximated generalized concordance probability an effect size measure for clear-cut
  decisions can be obtained.
  The package provides options to estimate time-dependent effects conveniently by
  including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of time, with or without
  making use of the weighting option.
