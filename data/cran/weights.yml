title: Weighting and Weighted Statistics
maintainer: Josh Pasek
description: 'Provides a variety of functions for producing simple weighted statistics,
  such as weighted Pearson''s correlations, partial correlations, Chi-Squared statistics,
  histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes some software for quickly recoding survey
  data and plotting point estimates from interaction terms in regressions (and multiply
  imputed regressions). NOTE: Weighted partial correlation calculations pulled to
  address a bug.'
