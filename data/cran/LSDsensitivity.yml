title: Sensitivity Analysis Tools for LSD
maintainer: Marcelo C. Pereira
description: Tools for sensitivity analysis of LSD simulation models. Reads object-oriented
  data produced by LSD simulation models and performs screening and global sensitivity
  analysis (Sobol decomposition method, Saltelli et al. (2008) ISBN:9780470725177).
  A Kriging or polynomial meta-model (Kleijnen (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2007.10.013>)
  is estimated using the simulation data to provide the data required by the Sobol
  decomposition. LSD (Laboratory for Simulation Development) is free software developed
  by Marco Valente (documentation and downloads available at <http://labsimdev.org>).
