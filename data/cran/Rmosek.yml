title: The R to MOSEK Optimization Interface
maintainer: Henrik A. Friberg
description: |-
  This is a meta-package designed to support the
  installation of Rmosek (>= 6.0) and bring the optimization
  facilities of MOSEK (>= 6.0) to the R-language. The interface
  supports large-scale optimization of many kinds: Mixed-integer
  and continuous linear, second-order cone, exponential cone and
  power cone optimization, as well as continuous semidefinite
  optimization. Rmosek and the R-language are open-source
  projects. MOSEK is a proprietary product, but unrestricted
  trial and academic licenses are available.
