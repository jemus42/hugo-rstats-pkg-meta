  P-value for Johansen Statistics.
maintainer: Fan Yang
description: 'Directly extract and plot stochastic common trends from<U+000a>a cointegration
  system using different approaches, currently<U+000a>including Kasa (1992) and Gonzalo
  and Granger (1995).<U+000a>The approach proposed by Gonzalo and Granger, also known
  as<U+000a>Permanent-Transitory Decomposition, is widely used in<U+000a>macroeconomics
  and market microstructure literature.<U+000a>Kasa''s approach, on the other hand,
  has a nice property that it only<U+000a>uses the super consistent estimator: the
  cointegration vector<U+000a>''beta''.<U+000a>This package also provides functions
  calculate P-value<U+000a>from Johansen Statistics according to the approximation
  method<U+000a>proposed by Doornik (1998).<U+000a>Update:<U+000a>0.7-1: Fix bugs
  in calculation alpha. Add formulas and more explanations.<U+000a>0.6-1: Rewrite
  the description file.<U+000a>0.5-1: Add functions to calculate P-value from Johansen
  statistic, and vice versa.'
