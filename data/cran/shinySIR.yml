  Interactive Plotting for Mathematical Models of Infectious
  Disease Spread
maintainer: Sinead E. Morris
description: Provides interactive plotting for mathematical models of infectious disease
  spread. Users can choose from a variety of common built-in ordinary differential
  equation (ODE) models (such as the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models), or create their own.
  This latter flexibility allows 'shinySIR' to be applied to simple ODEs from any
  discipline. The package is a useful teaching tool as students can visualize how
  changing different parameters can impact model dynamics, with minimal knowledge
  of coding in R. The built-in models are inspired by those featured in Keeling and
  Rohani (2008) <doi:10.2307/j.ctvcm4gk0> and Bjornstad (2018) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-97487-3>.
