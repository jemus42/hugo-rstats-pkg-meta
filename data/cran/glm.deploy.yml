version: 1.0.4
title: '''C'' and ''Java'' Source Code Generator for Fitted Glm Objects'
maintainer: Oscar Castro-Lopez
description: |-
  Provides two functions that generate source code implementing the predict
  function of fitted glm objects. In this version, code can be generated for either 'C'
  or 'Java'. The idea is to provide a tool for the easy and fast deployment of glm
  predictive models into production. The source code generated by this package implements
  two function/methods. One of such functions implements the equivalent to
  predict(type="response"), while the second implements predict(type="link"). Source code
  is written to disk as a .c or .java file in the specified path. In the case of c, an .h
  file is also generated.
