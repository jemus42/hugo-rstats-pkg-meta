  Power Calculations and Bayesian Analysis of Count Distributions
  and FECRT Data using MCMC
maintainer: Matthew Denwood
description: |-
  A set of functions to allow analysis of count data (such
  as faecal egg count data) using Bayesian MCMC methods.  Returns
  information on the possible values for mean count, coefficient
  of variation and zero inflation (true prevalence) present in
  the data.  A complete faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT)
  model is implemented, which returns inference on the true
  efficacy of the drug from the pre- and post-treatment data
  provided, using non-parametric bootstrapping as well as using
  Bayesian MCMC.  Functions to perform power analyses for faecal
  egg counts (including FECRT) are also provided.
