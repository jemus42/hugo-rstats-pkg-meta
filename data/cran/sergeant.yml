title: Tools to Transform and Query Data with 'Apache' 'Drill'
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  'Apache Drill' is a low-latency distributed query engine designed to enable
  data exploration and 'analytics' on both relational and non-relational 'datastores',
  scaling to petabytes of data. Methods are provided that enable working with 'Apache'
  'Drill' instances via the 'REST' 'API', 'JDBC' interface (optional), 'DBI' 'methods'
  and using 'dplyr'/'dbplyr' idioms.
