title: Excursion Sets and Contour Credibility Regions for Random Fields
maintainer: David Bolin
description: Functions that compute probabilistic excursion sets, contour credibility
  regions, contour avoiding regions, and simultaneous confidence bands for latent
  Gaussian random processes and fields. The package also contains functions that calculate
  these quantities for models estimated with the INLA package. The main references
  for excursions are Bolin and Lindgren (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12055>, Bolin and
  Lindgren (2017) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2016.1228537>, and Bolin and Lindgren (2018)
  <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i05>. These can be generated by the citation function in
  R.
