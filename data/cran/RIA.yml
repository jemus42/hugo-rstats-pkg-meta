maintainer: Marton Kolossvary
description: |-
  Radiomics image analysis toolbox for 2D and 3D radiological images. RIA supports DICOM, NIfTI and
  nrrd file formats. RIA calculates first-order, gray level co-occurrence matrix,
  gray level run length matrix and geometry-based statistics. Almost all calculations are done
  using vectorized formulas to optimize run speeds. Calculation of several thousands of parameters
  only takes minutes on a single core of a conventional PC.
