title: Doubly Weighted Linear Model
maintainer: Hugo Gasca-Aragon
description: This linear model solution is useful when both predictor and response
  have associated uncertainty. The doubly weights linear model solution is invariant
  on which quantity is used as predictor or response. Based on the results by Reed(1989)
  <doi:10.1119/1.15963> and Ripley & Thompson(1987) <doi:10.1039/AN9871200377>.
