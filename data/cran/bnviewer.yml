title: Interactive Visualization of Bayesian Networks
maintainer: Robson Fernandes
description: |-
  Bayesian networks provide an intuitive framework for probabilistic reasoning
  and its graphical nature can be interpreted quite clearly. Graph based methods
  of machine learning are becoming more popular because they offer a richer model
  of knowledge that can be understood by a human in a graphical format. The 'bnviewer'
  is an R Package that allows the interactive visualization of Bayesian Networks.
  The aim of this package is to improve the Bayesian Networks visualization over
  the basic and static views offered by existing packages.
