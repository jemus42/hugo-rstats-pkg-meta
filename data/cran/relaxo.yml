title: Relaxed Lasso
maintainer: Nicolai Meinshausen
description: Relaxed Lasso is a generalisation of the Lasso shrinkage<U+000a>technique
  for linear regression. Both variable selection and<U+000a>parameter estimation is
  achieved by regular Lasso, yet both<U+000a>steps do not necessarily use the same
  penalty parameter. The<U+000a>results include all standard Lasso solutions but allow
  often<U+000a>for sparser models while having similar or even slightly better<U+000a>predictive
  performance if many predictor variables are present.<U+000a>The package depends
  on the LARS package.
