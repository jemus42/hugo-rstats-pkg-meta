title: The Phylogenetic Regression of Grafen (1989)
maintainer: Alan Grafen
description: Provides general linear model facilities (single y-variable, multiple
  x-variables with arbitrary mixture of continuous and categorical and arbitrary interactions)
  for cross-species data. The method is, however, based on the nowadays rather uncommon
  situation in which uncertainty about a phylogeny is well represented by adopting
  a single polytomous tree. The theory is in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326,
  119-157) and aims to cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely related species
  tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny (a polytomy usually indicates ignorance
  about the true  sequence of binary splits).
