  A GUI-Based Program to Compute Probabilities Regarding Group
  Sequential Designs

description: |-
  A graphical user interface to compute group sequential designs
  based on normally distributed test statistics, particularly critical
  boundaries, power, drift, and confidence intervals of such designs. All
  computations are based on the alpha spending approach by Lan-DeMets with
  various alpha spending functions being available to choose among.
