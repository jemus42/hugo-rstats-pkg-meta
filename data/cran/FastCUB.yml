title: Fast EM and Best-Subset Selection for CUB Models for Rating Data
maintainer: Rosaria Simone
description: For ordinal rating data, consider the accelerated Expectation-Maximization
  algorithm to estimate and test models within the family of CUB models (where CUB
  stands for Combination of a discrete Uniform and a shifted Binomial distributions).
  The procedure is built upon Louis' identity for the observed information matrix.  Best-subset
  variable selection for CUB regression models is then implemented on such basis.
  The methods here implemented are illustrated and discussed in the preprint available
  from Researchgate by Simone R. (2020) <https://tinyurl.com/vvk563e>.
