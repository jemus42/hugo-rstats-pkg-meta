version: 1.0.3
title: Flexible Randomization-Based Inference
maintainer: Joseph J. Lee
description: Allows the user to conduct randomization-based inference for a wide variety
  of experimental scenarios. The package leverages a potential outcomes framework
  to output randomization-based p-values and null intervals for test statistics geared
  toward any estimands of interest, according to the specified null and alternative
  hypotheses. Users can define custom randomization schemes so that the randomization
  distributions are accurate for their experimental settings. The package also creates
  visualizations of randomization distributions and can test multiple test statistics
  simultaneously.
