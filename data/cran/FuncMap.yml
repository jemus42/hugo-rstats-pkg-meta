title: Hive Plots of R Package Function Calls
maintainer: Bryan A. Hanson
description: 'Analyzes the function calls in an R package and creates a hive plot
  of the calls, dividing them among functions that only make outgoing calls (sources),
  functions that have only incoming calls (sinks), and those that have both incoming
  calls and make outgoing calls (managers).  Function calls can be mapped by their
  absolute numbers, their normalized absolute numbers, or their rank.  FuncMap should
  be useful for comparing packages at a high level for their overall design.  Plus,
  it''s just plain fun.  The hive plot concept was developed by Martin Krzywinski
  (www.hiveplot.com) and inspired this package.  Note: this package is maintained
  for historical reasons. HiveR is a full package for creating hive plots.'
