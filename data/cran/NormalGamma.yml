title: Normal-gamma convolution model
maintainer: Sandra Plancade
description: 'The functions proposed in this package compute the density of the sum
  of a Gaussian and a gamma random variables, estimate the parameters and correct
  the noise effect in a gamma-signal and Gaussian-noise model. This package has been
  used to implement the background correction method for Illumina microarray data
  presented in Plancade S., Rozenholc Y. and Lund E. "Generalization of the normal-exponential
  model : exploration of a more accurate parameterization for the signal distribution
  on Illumina BeadArrays", BMC Bioinfo 2012, 13(329).'
