title: Lazy Learning for Local Regression
maintainer: Gianluca Bontempi
description: |-
  By combining constant, linear, and quadratic local models,
  lazy estimates the value of an unknown multivariate function on
  the basis of a set of possibly noisy samples of the function
  itself.  This implementation of lazy learning automatically
  adjusts the bandwidth on a query-by-query basis through a
  leave-one-out cross-validation.
