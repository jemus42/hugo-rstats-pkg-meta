title: Stochastic Limited Memory Quasi-Newton Optimizers
maintainer: David Cortes
description: |-
  Implementations of stochastic, limited-memory quasi-Newton optimizers,
  similar in spirit to the LBFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm,
  for smooth stochastic optimization. Implements the following methods:
  oLBFGS (online LBFGS) (Schraudolph, N.N., Yu, J. and Guenter, S., 2007 <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v2/schraudolph07a.html>),
  SQN (stochastic quasi-Newton) (Byrd, R.H., Hansen, S.L., Nocedal, J. and Singer, Y., 2016 <arXiv:1401.7020>),
  adaQN (adaptive quasi-Newton) (Keskar, N.S., Berahas, A.S., 2016, <arXiv:1511.01169>).
  Provides functions for easily creating R objects
  with partial_fit/predict methods from some given objective/gradient/predict functions.
  Includes an example stochastic logistic regression using these optimizers.
  Provides header files and registered C routines for using it directly from C/C++.
