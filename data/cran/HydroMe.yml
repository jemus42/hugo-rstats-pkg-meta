title: R codes for estimating water retention and infiltration model<U+000a>parameters
  using experimental data
maintainer: Christian Thine Omuto
description: This package is version 2 of HydroMe v.1 package. It<U+000a>estimates
  the parameters in infiltration and water retention<U+000a>models by curve-fitting
  method. The models considered are those<U+000a>that are commonly used in soil science.
  It has new models for<U+000a>water retention characteristic curve and debugging
  of errors in<U+000a>HydroMe v.1
