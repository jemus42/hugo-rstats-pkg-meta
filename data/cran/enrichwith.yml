version: 0.3.1
title: Methods to Enrich R Objects with Extra Components
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: Provides the "enrich" method to enrich list-like R objects with new,
  relevant components. The current version has methods for enriching objects of class
  'family', 'link-glm', 'lm', 'glm' and 'betareg'. The resulting objects preserve
  their class, so all methods associated with them still apply. The package also provides
  the 'enriched_glm' function that has the same interface as 'glm' but results in
  objects of class 'enriched_glm'. In addition to the usual components in a `glm`
  object, 'enriched_glm' objects carry an object-specific simulate method and functions
  to compute the scores, the observed and expected information matrix, the first-order
  bias, as well as model densities, probabilities, and quantiles at arbitrary parameter
  values. The package can also be used to produce customizable source code templates
  for the structured implementation of methods to compute new components and enrich
  arbitrary objects.
