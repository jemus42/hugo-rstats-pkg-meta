title: Nonparametric Analysis of Multivariate Data in Factorial Designs
maintainer: Maximilian Kiefel
description: |-
  Analysis of multivariate data with two-way completely randomized
  factorial design. The analysis is based on fully nonparametric, rank-based
  methods and uses test statistics based on the Dempster's ANOVA, Wilk's Lambda,
  Lawley-Hotelling and Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai criteria. The multivariate
  response is allowed to be ordinal, quantitative, binary or a mixture of the
  different variable types. The package offers two functions performing the
  analysis, one for small and the other for large sample sizes. The underlying methodology
  is largely described in Bathke and Harrar (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-39065-9_7> and in
  Munzel and Brunner (2000) <doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(99)00212-8>.
