  Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017-18 Men questionnaire data for Punjab, Pakistan. The results
  of the present survey are critically important for the purposes of Sustainable Development
  Goals (SDGs) monitoring, as the survey produces information on 32 global Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. The data was collected from 53,840 households
  selected at the second stage with systematic random sampling out of a sample of
  2,692 clusters selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Six questionnaires
  were used in the survey: (1) a household questionnaire to collect basic demographic
  information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and
  the dwelling; (2) a water quality testing questionnaire administered in three households
  in each cluster of the sample; (3) a questionnaire for individual women administered
  in each household to all women age 15-49 years; (4) a questionnaire for individual
  men administered in every second household to all men age 15-49 years; (5) an under-5
  questionnaire, administered to mothers (or caretakers) of all children under 5 living
  in the household; and (6) a questionnaire for children age 5-17 years, administered
  to the mother (or caretaker) of one randomly selected child age 5-17 years living
