description: |-
  Distance discriminant analysis method is one of
  classification methods according to multiindex performance
  parameters.However,the traditional Mahalanobis distance
  discriminant method treats with the importance of all
  parameters equally,and exaggerates the role of parameters which
  changes a little.The weighted Mahalanobis distance is used in
  discriminant analysis method to distinguish the importance of
  each parameter.In the concrete application,firstly based on the
  principal component analysis scheme,a new group of parameters
  and their corresponding percent contributions of the parameters
  are calculated ,and the weighted matrix is regarded as the
  diagonal matrix of the contributions rates.Setting data to
  standardization,then the weighted Mahalanobis distance can be
  calculated.Besides the methods metioned above,bayes method is
  also given.
