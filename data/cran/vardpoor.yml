description: 'Generation of domain variables, linearization of several nonlinear population
  statistics (the ratio of two totals, weighted income percentile, relative median
  income ratio, at-risk-of-poverty rate, at-risk-of-poverty threshold, Gini coefficient,
  gender pay gap, the aggregate replacement ratio, the relative median income ratio,
  median income below at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile share ratio, relative
  median at-risk-of-poverty gap), computation of regression residuals in case of weight
  calibration, variance estimation of sample surveys by the ultimate cluster method
  (Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow,Theory, vol. I: Methods and Applications; vol. II: Theory.
  1953, New York: John Wiley and Sons), variance estimation for longitudinal, cross-sectional
  measures and measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster sampling
  designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015, <doi:10.1111/rssa.12116>). Several other precision
  measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the margin
  of error, confidence interval, design effect.'
