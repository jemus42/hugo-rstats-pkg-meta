title: Sequentially-Allocated Latent Structure Optimization
maintainer: David B. Dahl
description: 'Point estimation for partition distributions using the sequentially-allocated
  latent structure optimization (SALSO) method to minimize the expectation of the
  Binder loss or the lower bound of the expectation of the variation of information
  loss. The SALSO method was presented at the workshop "Bayesian Nonparametric Inference:
  Dependence Structures and their Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico on December 6, 2017.
