title: Fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model
maintainer: Helen Ogden
description: |-
  Conduct inference about generalized linear mixed models, with a
  choice about which method to use to approximate the likelihood. In addition
  to the Laplace and adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximations, which are
  borrowed from 'lme4', the likelihood may be approximated by the sequential
  reduction approximation, or an importance sampling approximation. These
  methods provide an accurate approximation to the likelihood in some
  situations where it is not possible to use adaptive Gaussian quadrature.
