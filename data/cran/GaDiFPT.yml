title: First Passage Time Simulation for Gaussian Diffusion Processes
maintainer: Maria Francesca Carfora
description: In this package we consider Gaussian Diffusion processes and smooth thresholds.
  After evaluating the mean of the process to check the subthreshold regimen hypothesis,
  the FPT density function is reconstructed via the numerical quadrature of the integral
  equation in (Buonocore 1987); first passage times are also generated by the method
  in (Buonocore 2014) and results are compared. The timestep of the simulations can
  iteratively be refined. User should provide the functional form for the drift and
  the infinitesimal variance in the script 'userfunc.R' and for the threshold in the
  script 'userthresh.R'. All the parameters required by the implementation are to
  be set in the script 'userparam.R'. Example scripts for common drifts and thresholds
  are given.
