title: Execution Functions for Tick Data Back Test
maintainer: SONG Yang
description: Functions to execute orders in backtesting using tick data. A testing
  platform was established by the four major execution functions, namely 'LimitBuy',
  'LimitSell', 'MarketBuy' and 'MarketSell', which enclosed all tedious aspects (such
  as queueing for order executions and calculate actual executed volumes) for order
  execution using tick data. Such that one can focus on the logic of strategies, rather
  than its execution.
