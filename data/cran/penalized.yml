  L1 (Lasso and Fused Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) Penalized Estimation
  in GLMs and in the Cox Model
maintainer: ORPHANED
description: |-
  Fitting possibly high dimensional penalized
  regression models. The penalty structure can be any combination
  of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2 penalty (ridge) and a
  positivity constraint on the regression coefficients. The
  supported regression models are linear, logistic and Poisson
  regression and the Cox Proportional Hazards model.
  Cross-validation routines allow optimization of the tuning
  parameters.
