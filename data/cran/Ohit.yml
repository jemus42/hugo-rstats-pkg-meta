title: OGA+HDIC+Trim and High-Dimensional Linear Regression Models
maintainer: Hai-Tang Chiou
description: 'Ing and Lai (2011) <doi:10.5705/ss.2010.081> proposed a high-dimensional
  model selection procedure that comprises three steps: orthogonal greedy algorithm
  (OGA), high-dimensional information criterion (HDIC), and Trim. The first two steps,
  OGA and HDIC, are used to sequentially select input variables and determine stopping
  rules, respectively. The third step, Trim, is used to delete irrelevant variables
  remaining in the second step. This package aims at fitting a high-dimensional linear
  regression model via OGA+HDIC+Trim.'
