  Marker-Based Estimation of Heritability Using Individual Plant
  or Plot Data
maintainer: Willem Kruijer
description: Implements marker-based estimation of heritability when observations
  on genetically identical replicates are available. These can be either observations
  on individual plants or plot-level data in a field trial. Heritability can then
  be estimated using a mixed model for the individual plant or plot data. For comparison,
  also mixed-model based estimation using genotypic means and estimation of repeatability
  with ANOVA are implemented. For illustration the package contains several datasets
  for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
