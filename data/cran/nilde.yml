  Nonnegative Integer Solutions of Linear Diophantine Equations
  with Applications
maintainer: Natalya Pya Arnqvist
description: Routines for enumerating all existing nonnegative integer solutions of
  a linear Diophantine equation. The package provides routines for solving 0-1, bounded
  and unbounded knapsack problems; 0-1, bounded and unbounded subset sum problems;
  additive partitioning of natural numbers; and one-dimensional bin-packing problem.
