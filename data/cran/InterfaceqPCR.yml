maintainer: Olivier LE GOFF
description: Graphical User Interface allowing to determine the concentration in the
  sample in CFU per mL or in number of copies per mL provided to qPCR results after
  with or without PMA treatment. This package is simply to use because no knowledge
  in R commands is necessary. A graphic represents the standard curve, and a table
  containing the result for each sample is created.
