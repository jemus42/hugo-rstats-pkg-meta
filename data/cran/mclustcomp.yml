title: Measures for Comparing Clusters
maintainer: Kisung You
description: |-
  Given a set of data points, a clustering is defined as a disjoint partition
  where each pair of sets in a partition has no overlapping elements.
  This package provides 25 methods that play a role somewhat similar to
  distance or metric that measures similarity of two clusterings - or partitions.
  For a more detailed description, see Meila, M. (2005) <doi:10.1145/1102351.1102424>.
