title: Bayesian Applied Regression Modeling via Stan
maintainer: Ben Goodrich
description: |-
  Estimates previously compiled regression models using the 'rstan'
  package, which provides the R interface to the Stan C++ library for Bayesian
  estimation. Users specify models via the customary R syntax with a formula and
  data.frame plus some additional arguments for priors.
