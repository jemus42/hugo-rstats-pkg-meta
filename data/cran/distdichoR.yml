  Distributional Method for the Dichotomisation of Continuous
  Outcomes
maintainer: Odile Sauzet
description: |-
  Contains a range of functions covering the present
  development of the distributional method for the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes.
  The method provides estimates with standard error of a comparison of proportions
  (difference, odds ratio and risk ratio) derived, with similar precision, from a comparison of means.
