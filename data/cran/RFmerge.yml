  Merging of Satellite Datasets with Ground Observations using
  Random Forests
maintainer: Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini
description: S3 implementation of the Random Forest MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which
  combines two or more satellite-based datasets (e.g., precipitation products, topography)
  with ground observations to produce a new dataset with improved spatio-temporal
  distribution of the target field. In particular, this package was developed to merge
  different Satellite-based Rainfall Estimates (SREs) with measurements from rain
  gauges, in order to obtain a new precipitation dataset where the time series in
  the rain gauges are used to correct different types of errors present in the SREs.
  However, this package might be used to merge other hydrological/environmental satellite
  fields with point observations. For details, see Baez-Villanueva et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2019.111606>.
  Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
