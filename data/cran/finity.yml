title: Test for Finiteness of Moments in a Distribution
maintainer: Torsten Heinrich
description: |-
  The purpose of this package is to tests whether a given
  moment of the distribution of a given sample is finite or not. For
  heavy-tailed distributions with tail exponent b, only moments of
  order smaller than b are finite. Tail exponent and heavy-
  tailedness are notoriously difficult to ascertain. But the
  finiteness of moments (including fractional moments) can be tested
  directly. This package does that following the test suggested by
  Trapani (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.08.006>.
