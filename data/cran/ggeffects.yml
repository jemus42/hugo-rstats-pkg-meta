  Create Tidy Data Frames of Marginal Effects for 'ggplot' from
  Model Outputs
maintainer: Daniel LÃ¼decke
description: |-
  Compute marginal effects from statistical models and returns the
  result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to use with the
  'ggplot2'-package. Marginal effects can be calculated for many different
  models. Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported.
  The main functions are ggpredict(), ggemmeans() and ggeffect(). There is a
  generic plot()-method to plot the results using 'ggplot2'.
