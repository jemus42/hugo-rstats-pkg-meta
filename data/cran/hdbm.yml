title: High Dimensional Bayesian Mediation Analysis
maintainer: Alexander Rix
description: |-
  Perform mediation analysis in the presence of high-dimensional
  mediators based on the potential outcome framework. High dimensional
  Bayesian mediation (HDBM), developed by Song et al (2018)
  <doi:10.1101/467399>, relies on two Bayesian sparse linear mixed models to
  simultaneously analyze a relatively large number of mediators for a
  continuous exposure and outcome assuming a small number of mediators are
  truly active. This sparsity assumption also allows the extension of
  univariate mediator analysis by casting the identification of active
  mediators as a variable selection problem and applying Bayesian methods
  with continuous shrinkage priors on the effects.
