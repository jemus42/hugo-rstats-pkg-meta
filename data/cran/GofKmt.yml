title: Khmaladze Martingale Transformation Goodness-of-Fit Test
maintainer: Jiwoong Kim
description: 'Consider a goodness-of-fit(GOF) problem of testing whether a random
  sample comes from one sample location-scale model where location and scale parameters
  are unknown. It is well known that Khmaladze martingale transformation method -
  which was proposed by Khmaladze (1981) <DOI:10.1137/1126027> - provides asymptotic
  distribution free test for the GOF problem. This package contains one function:
  KhmaladzeTrans(). In this version, KhmaladzeTrans() provides test statistic and
  critical value of GOF test for normal, Cauchy, logistic, Gamma, and Weibull distributions.'
