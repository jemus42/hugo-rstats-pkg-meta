maintainer: Sandeep Kumar Patakamuri
description: |-
  Innovative Trend Analysis is a graphical method to examine the trends in time series data. Sequential Mann-Kendall test uses the intersection of prograde and retrograde series to indicate the possible change point in time series data. Distribution free cumulative sum charts indicate location and significance of the change point in time series.
