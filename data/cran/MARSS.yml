title: Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space Modeling
maintainer: Elizabeth Holmes - NOAA Federal
description: The MARSS package provides maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for
  constrained and unconstrained linear multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS)
  models fit to multivariate time-series data.  Fitting is primarily via an Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm, although fitting via the BFGS algorithm (using the optim function)
  is also provided.  MARSS models are a class of dynamic linear model (DLM) and vector
  autoregressive model (VAR) model.  Functions are provided for parametric and innovations
  bootstrapping, Kalman filtering and smoothing, bootstrap model selection criteria
  (AICb), confidences intervals via the Hessian approximation and via bootstrapping
  and calculation of auxiliary residuals for detecting outliers and shocks.  The user
  guide shows examples of using MARSS for parameter estimation for a variety of applications,
  model selection, dynamic factor analysis, outlier and shock detection, and addition
  of covariates.  Type RShowDoc("UserGuide", package="MARSS") at the R command line
  to open the MARSS user guide.  Online workshops (lectures and computer labs) at
