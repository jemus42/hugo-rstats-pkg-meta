  Convert Categorical Representations of Logicals to Actual
  Logicals
maintainer: Oliver Keyes
description: |-
  Survey systems and other third-party data sources commonly use non-standard representations of logical values when
  it comes to qualitative data - "Yes", "No" and "N/A", say. batman is a package designed to seamlessly convert these into logicals.
  It is highly localised, and contains equivalents to boolean values in languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian,
  Turkish, Chinese and Polish.
