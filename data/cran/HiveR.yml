maintainer: Bryan A. Hanson
description: 'Creates and plots 2D and 3D hive plots. Hive plots are a unique method
  of displaying networks of many types in which node properties are mapped to axes
  using meaningful properties rather than being arbitrarily positioned.  The hive
  plot concept was invented by Martin Krzywinski at the Genome Science Center (www.hiveplot.net/).  Keywords:
  networks, food webs, linnet, systems biology, bioinformatics.'
