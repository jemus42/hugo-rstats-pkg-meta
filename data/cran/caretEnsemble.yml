title: Ensembles of Caret Models
maintainer: Zachary A. Deane-Mayer
description: |-
  Functions for creating ensembles of caret models: caretList()
  and caretStack().  caretList() is a convenience function for fitting multiple
  caret::train() models to the same dataset. caretStack() will make linear or
  non-linear combinations of these models, using a caret::train() model as a
  meta-model, and caretEnsemble() will make a robust linear combination of
  models using a GLM.
