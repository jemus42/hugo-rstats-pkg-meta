title: Composite Likelihood Estimation for Spatial Data
maintainer: Ting Fung (Ralph) Ma
description: Composite likelihood approach is implemented to estimating statistical
  models for spatial ordinal and proportional data based on Feng et al. (2014) <doi:10.1002/env.2306>.
  Parameter estimates are identified by maximizing composite log-likelihood functions
  using the limited memory BFGS optimization algorithm with bounding constraints,
  while standard errors are obtained by estimating the Godambe information matrix.
