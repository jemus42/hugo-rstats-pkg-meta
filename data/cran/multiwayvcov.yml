title: Multi-Way Standard Error Clustering
maintainer: Nathaniel Graham
description: |-
  Exports two functions implementing
  multi-way clustering using the method suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, &
  Miller (2011) and cluster (or block)
  bootstrapping for estimating variance-covariance matrices. Normal one and
  two-way clustering matches the results of other common statistical
  packages.  Missing values are handled transparently and rudimentary
  parallelization support is provided.
