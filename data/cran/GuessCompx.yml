title: Empirically Estimates Algorithm Complexity
maintainer: Marc Agenis
description: |-
  Make an empirical guess on the time and memory complexities of an algorithm or a function.
  Tests multiple, increasing size random samples of your data and tries to fit various complexity functions o(n), o(n2), o(log(n)), etc.
  Based on best fit, it predicts the full computation time on your whole dataset. Results are plotted with 'ggplot2'.
