title: Transmissions and Receptions in a Hop by Hop Network
maintainer: Christian E. Galarza
description: Computes the expectation of the number of transmissions and receptions
  considering a Hop-by-Hop transport model with limited number of retransmissions
  per packet. It provides the theoretical results shown in Palma et. al.(2016) <DOI:10.1109/TLA.2016.7555237>
  and also estimated values based on Monte Carlo simulations. It is also possible
  to consider random data and ACK probabilities.
