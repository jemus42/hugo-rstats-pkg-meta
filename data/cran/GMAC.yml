title: Genomic Mediation Analysis with Adaptive Confounding Adjustment
maintainer: Fan Yang
description: |-
  Performs genomic mediation
  analysis with adaptive confounding adjustment (GMAC) proposed by Yang et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/078683>. It implements large scale
  mediation analysis and adaptively selects potential confounding variables to
  adjust for each mediation test from a pool of candidate confounders. The package
  is tailored for but not limited to genomic mediation analysis (e.g., cis-gene
  mediating trans-gene regulation pattern where an eQTL, its cis-linking gene
  transcript, and its trans-gene transcript play the roles as treatment, mediator
  and the outcome, respectively), restricting to scenarios with the presence of
  cis-association (i.e., treatment-mediator association) and random eQTL (i.e.,
  treatment).
