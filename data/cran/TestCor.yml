  FWER and FDR Controlling Procedures for Multiple Correlation
  Tests
maintainer: Gannaz Irene
description: |2-

  Different multiple testing procedures for correlation tests are implemented. These procedures were shown to theoretically control asymptotically the Family Wise Error Rate (Roux (2018) <https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01971574v1>) or the False Discovery Rate (Cai & Liu (2016) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.999157>). The package gather four test statistics used in correlation testing, four FWER procedures with either single step or stepdown versions, and four FDR procedures.
