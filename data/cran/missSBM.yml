title: Handling Missing Data in Stochastic Block Models
maintainer: Julien Chiquet
description: |-
  When a network is partially observed (here, NAs in the adjacency matrix rather than 1 or 0
  due to missing information between node pairs), it is possible to account for the underlying process
  that generates those NAs. 'missSBM' adjusts the popular stochastic block model from network data
  sampled under various missing data conditions, as described in Tabouy, Barbillon and Chiquet (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1562934>.
