title: Computerized Adaptive Testing and Decision Trees
maintainer: Javier Rodriguez-Cuadrado
description: Implements the Merged Tree-CAT method (Javier Rodriguez-Cuadrado et al.,
  2020, <doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113066>) to generate Computerized Adaptive Tests
  (CATs) based on a decision tree. The tree growth is controlled by merging branches
  with similar trait distributions and estimations. This package has the necessary
  tools for creating CATs and estimate the subject's ability level.
