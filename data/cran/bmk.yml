title: MCMC diagnostics package
maintainer: Matthew Krachey
description: MCMC diagnostic package that contains tools to diagnose<U+000a>convergence
  as well as to evaluate sensitivity studies,<U+000a>Includes summary functions which
  output mean, median,<U+000a>95percentCI, Gelman & Rubin diagnostics and the Hellinger<U+000a>distance
  based diagnostics, Also contains functions to<U+000a>determine when an MCMC chain
  has converged via Hellinger<U+000a>distance, A function is also provided to compare
  outputs from<U+000a>identically dimensioned chains for determining sensitivy to<U+000a>prior
  distribution assumptions
