title: An Extended Rao-Stirling Diversity Index to Handle Missing Data
maintainer: Maria del Carmen Calatrava Moreno
description: "A collection of functions to compute the Rao-Stirling diversity index\n(Porter
  and Rafols, 2009) <DOI:10.1007/s11192-008-2197-2> and its extension to\nacknowledge
  missing data (i.e.,\tuncategorized references) by calculating its\ninterval of uncertainty
  using\tmathematical optimization as proposed in Calatrava\net al. (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-1842-4>.\nThe
  Rao-Stirling diversity index is a well-established bibliometric indicator\nto measure
  the interdisciplinarity of scientific publications. Apart from the\nobligatory dataset
  of publications with their respective references and\ta\ntaxonomy of disciplines
  that categorizes references as well as a measure of\nsimilarity between the disciplines,
  the Rao-Stirling diversity index requires\na complete categorization of all references
  of a publication into disciplines.\nThus, it fails for a incomplete categorization;
  in this case, the robust\nextension has to be used, which encodes the uncertainty
  caused by missing\nbibliographic data as an uncertainty interval.\nClassification
