title: Useful functions for visual word recognition research
maintainer: Emmanuel Keuleers
description: Functions and data for use in visual word recognition research:<U+000a>Computation
  of neighbors (Hamming and Levenshtein<U+000a>distances), average distances to neighbors
  (e.g., OLD20),<U+000a>and Coltheart's N. Also includes the LD1NN algorithm to<U+000a>detect
  bias in the composition of a lexical decision task. Most of<U+000a>the functions
  support parallel execution. Supplies wordlists for<U+000a>several languages. Uses
  the string distance functions from the stringdist package by Mark van der Loo.
