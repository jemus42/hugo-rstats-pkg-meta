  Selecting Bandwidth for Kernel Density Estimator with Minimum
  Distance Method
maintainer: Genzo Kaga
description: Selects bandwidth for the kernel density estimator with minimum distance
  method as proposed by Devroye and Lugosi (1996). The minimum distance method directly
  selects the optimal kernel density estimator from countably infinite kernel density
  estimators and indirectly selects the optimal bandwidth. This package selects the
  optimal bandwidth from finite kernel density estimators.
