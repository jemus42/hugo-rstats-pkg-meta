maintainer: Chris Brunsdon
description: |-
  Solves Teitz and Bart's p-median problem - given a set of
  points attempts to find subset of size p such that summed distances of any
  point in the set to the nearest point in p is minimised.  Although
  generally effective, this algorithm does not guarantee that a globally
  optimal subset is found.
