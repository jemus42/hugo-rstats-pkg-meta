title: Grammatical Evolution for R
maintainer: Farzad Noorian
description: A native R implementation of grammatical evolution (GE). GE facilitates
  the discovery of programs that can achieve a desired goal. This is done by performing
  an evolutionary optimisation over a population of R expressions generated via a
  user-defined context-free grammar (CFG) and cost function.
