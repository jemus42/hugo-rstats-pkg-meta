description: 'Computation and visualization of Taxicab Correspondence Analysis, Choulakian
  (2006) <doi:10.1007/s11336-004-1231-4>.  Classical correspondence analysis (CA)
  is a statistical method to analyse 2-dimensional tables of positive numbers and
  is typically applied to contingency tables (Benzecri, J.-P. (1973). L''Analyse des
  Donnees. Volume II. L''Analyse des Correspondances. Paris, France: Dunod).  Classical
  CA is based on the Euclidean distance.  Taxicab CA is like classical CA but is based
  on the Taxicab or Manhattan distance.  For some tables, Taxicab CA gives more informative
  results than classical CA.'
