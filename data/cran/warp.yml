title: Group Dates
maintainer: Davis Vaughan
description: |-
  Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods
  including: yearly, monthly, by second, by week of the month, and more.
  The groups are defined in such a way that they also represent the
  distance between dates in terms of the period. This extracts valuable
  information that can be used in further calculations that rely on a
  specific temporal spacing between observations.
