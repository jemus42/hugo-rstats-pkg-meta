title: An Implementation of the 'DoubleClick for Publishers' API
maintainer: Steven M. Mortimer
description: |-
  Functions to interact with the 'Google DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP)' API
  <https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/start> (recently renamed to
  'Google Ad Manager'). This package is automatically compiled from the API WSDL
  (Web Service Description Language) files to dictate how the API is structured.
  Theoretically, all API actions are possible using this package; however, care
  must be taken to format the inputs correctly and parse the outputs correctly.
  Please see the 'Google Ad Manager' API reference <https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes>
  and this package's website <https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/rdfp/> for more
  information, documentation, and examples.
