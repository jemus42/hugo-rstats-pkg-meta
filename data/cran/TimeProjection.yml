maintainer: Jeffrey Wong
description: |-
  Extract useful time components of a date object, such as
  day of week, weekend, holiday, day of month, etc, and put it in
  a data frame.  This can be used to create many predictor
  variables out of a single time variable, which can then be used
  in a regression or decision tree.  Also includes function
  plotCalendarHeatmap which draws a calendar and overlays a
  heatmap based on values.
