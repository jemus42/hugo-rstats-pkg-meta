title: Decision Models with Multi Attribute Utility Theory
maintainer: Pedro Guarderas
description: |-
  Provides functions for the creation, evaluation and test of decision models based in
  Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). Can process and evaluate local risk aversion utilities
  for a set of indexes, compute utilities and weights for the whole decision tree defining the
