title: Acyclic Probabilistic Finite Automata
maintainer: Smitha Ankinakatte
description: gRapfa is for modelling discrete longitudinal data using acyclic probabilistic
  finite automata (APFA). The package contains functions for constructing APFA models
  from a given data using penalized likelihood methods. For graphical display of APFA
  models, gRapfa depends on 'igraph package'. gRapfa also contains an interface function
  to Beagle software that implements an efficient model selection algorithm.
