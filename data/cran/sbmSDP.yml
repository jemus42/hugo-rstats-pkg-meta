  Semidefinite Programming for Fitting Block Models of Equal Block
  Sizes
maintainer: Arash A. Amini
description: An ADMM implementation of SDP-1, a semidefinite programming relaxation
  of the maximum likelihood estimator for fitting a block model. SDP-1 has a tendency
  to produce equal-sized blocks and is ideal for producing a form of network histogram
  approximating a nonparametric graphon model. Alternatively, it can be used for community
  detection. (This is experimental code, proceed with caution.)
