version: 0.8.0
title: Toolkit for Corpus Analysis
maintainer: Andreas Blaette
description: |-
  Library for corpus analysis using the Corpus Workbench as an
  efficient back end for indexing and querying large corpora. The package offers
  functionality to flexibly create partitions and to carry out basic statistical
  operations (count, co-occurrences etc.). The original full text of documents
  can be reconstructed and inspected at any time. Beyond that, the package is
  intended to serve as an interface to packages implementing advanced statistical
  procedures. Respective data structures (document term matrices, term co-
  occurrence matrices etc.) can be created based on the indexed corpora.
