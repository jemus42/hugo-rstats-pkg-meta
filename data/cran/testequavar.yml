title: Bootstrap Tests for Equality of 2, 3, or 4 Population Variances
maintainer: Dexter Cahoy
description: |-
  Tests the hypothesis  that variances are homogeneous or not using bootstrap. The procedure uses a variance-based statistic, and is derived from a normal-theory test.
  The test equivalently expressed the hypothesis as a function of the log contrasts of the population variances. A box-type acceptance region is constructed to test the hypothesis. See Cahoy (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2010.04.012>.
