title: Nonparametrics with Clustered Binary and Multinomial Data
maintainer: Aniko Szabo
description: |-
  Implements non-parametric analyses for clustered
  binary and multinomial data. The elements of the cluster are assumed
  exchangeable, and identical joint distribution (also known as marginal
  compatibility, or reproducibility) is assumed for clusters of different
  sizes. A trend test based on stochastic ordering is implemented.
