  Bayesian Meta Analysis for Studying Cross-Phenotype Genetic
  Associations
maintainer: Arunabha Majumdar
description: |-
  A Bayesian meta-analysis method for studying cross-phenotype
  genetic associations. It uses summary-level data across multiple phenotypes to
  simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association
  and estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk locus. CPBayes
  is based on a spike and slab prior.
