  Facilitates dynamic exploration of text collections through an
  intuitive graphical user interface and the power of regular expressions.
  The package contains 1) a helper function to convert a data frame to a
  'corporaexplorerobject', 2) a 'Shiny' app for fast and flexible exploration
  of a 'corporaexplorerobject', and 3) a 'Shiny' app for simple
  retrieval/extraction of documents from a 'corporaexplorerobject' in a
  reading-friendly format. The package also includes demo apps with which
  one can explore Jane Austen's novels and the State of the Union Addresses
  (data from the 'janeaustenr' and 'sotu' packages respectively).
