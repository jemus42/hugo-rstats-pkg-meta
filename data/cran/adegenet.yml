title: Exploratory Analysis of Genetic and Genomic Data
maintainer: Zhian N. Kamvar
description: |-
  Toolset for the exploration of genetic and genomic
  data. Adegenet provides formal (S4) classes for storing and handling
  various genetic data, including genetic markers with varying ploidy
  and hierarchical population structure ('genind' class), alleles counts
  by populations ('genpop'), and genome-wide SNP data ('genlight'). It
  also implements original multivariate methods (DAPC, sPCA), graphics,
  statistical tests, simulation tools, distance and similarity measures,
  and several spatial methods. A range of both empirical and simulated
  datasets is also provided to illustrate various methods.
