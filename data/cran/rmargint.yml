title: Robust Marginal Integration Procedures
maintainer: Alejandra Martinez
description: |-
  Three robust marginal integration procedures for additive models based on local
  polynomial kernel smoothers. As a preliminary estimator of the multivariate
  function for the marginal integration procedure, a first approach uses local
  constant M-estimators, a second one uses local polynomials of order 1 over all the
  components of covariates, and the third one uses M-estimators based on local
  polynomials but only in the direction of interest. For this last approach,
  estimators of the derivatives of the additive functions can be obtained. All three
  procedures can compute predictions for points outside the training set if desired.
