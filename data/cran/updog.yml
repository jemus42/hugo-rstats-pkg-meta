title: Flexible Genotyping for Polyploids
maintainer: David Gerard
description: |-
  Implements empirical Bayes approaches to genotype
  polyploids from next generation sequencing data while
  accounting for allelic bias, overdispersion, and sequencing
  error. The main functions are flexdog() and multidog(),
  which allow the specification
  of many different genotype distributions. An experimental
  function that takes into account varying levels of relatedness
  is implemented in mupdog(). Also provided are functions to
  simulate genotypes, rgeno(), and read-counts, rflexdog(), as well as
  functions to calculate oracle genotyping error rates, oracle_mis(), and
  correlation with the true genotypes, oracle_cor(). These latter two
  functions are useful for read depth calculations. Run
  browseVignettes(package = "updog") in R for example usage. See
  Gerard et al. (2018) <doi:10.1534/genetics.118.301468> and
  Gerard and Ferrao (2019) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz852> for details
  on the implemented methods.
