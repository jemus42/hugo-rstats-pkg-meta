title: Protein Binding Models
maintainer: Jonathan Davies
description: Binding models which are useful when analysing protein-ligand interactions
  by techniques such as Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) or Surface Plasmon Resonance
  (SPR). Naman B. Shah, Thomas M. Duncan (2014) <doi:10.3791/51383>. Hoang H. Nguyen
  et al. (2015) <doi:10.3390/s150510481>. After initial binding parameters are known,
  binding curves can be simulated and parameters can be varied. The models within
  this package may also be used to fit a curve to measured binding data using non-linear
  regression.
