title: Analysis with Profile Hidden Markov Models
maintainer: Shaun Wilkinson
description: |-
  Designed for the development and application of
  hidden Markov models and profile HMMs for biological sequence analysis.
  Contains functions for multiple and pairwise sequence alignment,
  model construction and parameter optimization, file import/export,
  implementation of the forward, backward and Viterbi algorithms for
  conditional sequence probabilities, tree-based sequence weighting,
  and sequence simulation.
  Features a wide variety of potential applications including
  database searching, gene-finding and annotation, phylogenetic
  analysis and sequence classification.
  Based on the models and algorithms described in Durbin et
  al (1998, ISBN: 9780521629713).
