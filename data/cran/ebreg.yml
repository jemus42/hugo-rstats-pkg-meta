title: Implementation of the Empirical Bayes Method
maintainer: Yiqi Tang
description: Implements a Bayesian-like approach to the high-dimensional sparse linear
  regression problem based on an empirical or data-dependent prior distribution, which
  can be used for estimation/inference on the model parameters, variable selection,
  and prediction of a future response. The method was first presented in Martin, Ryan
  and Mess, Raymond and Walker, Stephen G (2017) <doi:10.3150/15-BEJ797>. More details
  focused on the prediction problem are given in Martin, Ryan and Tang, Yiqi (2019)
  <arXiv:1903.00961>.
