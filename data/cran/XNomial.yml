  Exact Goodness-of-Fit Test for Multinomial Data with Fixed
  Probabilities
maintainer: Bill Engels
description: |-
  Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio. For
  example, a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types in the
  relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1. To see whether a set of observed counts
  fits this expectation, one can examine all possible outcomes with xmulti() or a
  random sample of them with xmonte() and find the probability of an observation
  deviating from the expectation by at least as much as the observed. As a
  measure of deviation from the expected, one can use the log-likelihood
  ratio, the multinomial probability, or the classic chi-square statistic. A
  histogram of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with the
  asymptotic curve.
