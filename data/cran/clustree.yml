title: Visualise Clusterings at Different Resolutions
maintainer: Luke Zappia
description: |-
  Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when
  approaching a clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to
  look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases. This package
  allows you to produce clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating
  clusterings as resolution increases.
