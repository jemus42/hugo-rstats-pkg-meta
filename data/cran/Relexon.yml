title: Explore the UK's National Power Grid Datasets
maintainer: Phil Hunter
description: The purpose of 'Relexon' is to allow R users to pull data from the UK's
  Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service, otherwise known as 'Elexon', using the 'BMRS'
  API <https://www.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=help/about-us>. This can range from different
  types of electricity generation, how much electricity is used in a 5-minute period,
  imports, temperatures and forecasts. Users will require an 'Elexon' key, which are
  freely available by registering at <https://www.elexonportal.co.uk>.
