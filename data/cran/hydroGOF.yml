  Goodness-of-Fit Functions for Comparison of Simulated and
  Observed Hydrological Time Series
maintainer: Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini
description: S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit
  measures between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used during
  the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models. Missing values
  in observed and/or simulated values can be removed before computations. Comments
  / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
