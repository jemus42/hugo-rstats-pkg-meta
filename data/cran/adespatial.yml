maintainer: St√©phane Dray
description: |-
  Tools for the multiscale spatial analysis of multivariate data.
  Several methods are based on the use of a spatial weighting matrix and its
  eigenvector decomposition (Moran's Eigenvectors Maps, MEM).
  Several approaches are described in the review Dray et al (2012) <doi:10.1890/11-1183.1>.
