version: 0.3.1
title: Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible
maintainer: Gjalt-Jorn Peters
description: |-
  This is a new version of the 'userfriendlyscience' package,
  which has grown a bit unwieldy. Therefore, distinct functionalities
  are being 'consciously uncoupled' into different packages. This package
  contains the general-purpose tools and utilities (see the
  'behaviorchange' package, the 'rosetta' package, and the
  soon-to-be-released 'scd' package for other functionality), and
  is the most direct 'successor' of the original 'userfriendlyscience' package.
  For example, this package contains a number of basic functions to create
  higher level plots, such as diamond plots, to easily plot sampling
  distributions, to generate confidence intervals, to plan study sample sizes
  for confidence intervals, and to do some basic operations such as
  (dis)attenuate effect size estimates.
