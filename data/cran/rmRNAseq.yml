title: RNA-Seq Analysis for Repeated-Measures Data
maintainer: Yet Nguyen
description: |-
  A differential expression analysis method for RNA-seq data from repeated-measures design
  using general linear model framework and parametric bootstrap inference. The method accounts for
  the dependence of gene expression levels due to the repeated-measures through continuous autoregressive
  correlation structure. The method is described in Chapter 4 of
  Nguyen (2018) <https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7433&context=etd>.
