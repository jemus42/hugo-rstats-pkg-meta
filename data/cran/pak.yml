title: Another Approach to Package Installation
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  The goal of 'pak' is to make package installation faster and
  more reliable. In particular, it performs all HTTP operations in parallel,
  so metadata resolution and package downloads are fast. Metadata and package
  files are cached on the local disk as well. 'pak' has a dependency solver,
  so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation. This
  version of 'pak' supports CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages as well.
