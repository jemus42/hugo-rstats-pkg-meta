title: Mouse-Tracking Measures from Trajectory Data
maintainer: Moreno I. Coco
description: Extract from two-dimensional x-y coordinates of an arm-reaching trajectory,
  several dependent measures such as area under the curve, latency to start the movement,
  x-flips, etc.; which characterize the action-dynamics of the response. Mainly developed
  to analyze data coming from mouse-tracking experiments.
