title: Sensitivity Analyses for Unmeasured Confounding in Meta-Analyses
maintainer: Maya B. Mathur
description: |-
  Conducts sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding in
  random-effects meta-analysis per Mathur & VanderWeele (in preparation).
  Given output from a random-effects meta-analysis with a relative risk
  outcome, computes point estimates and inference for: (1) the proportion
  of studies with true causal effect sizes more extreme than a specified threshold
  of scientific significance; and (2) the minimum bias factor and confounding
  strength required to reduce to less than a specified threshold the proportion
  of studies with true effect sizes of scientifically significant size.
  Creates plots and tables for visualizing these metrics across a range of bias values.
  Provides tools to easily scrape study-level data from a published forest plot or
  summary table to obtain the needed estimates when these are not reported.
