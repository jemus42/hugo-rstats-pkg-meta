description: |-
  Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to transform
  features of a instance to a vector. Thus, it is a method to transform a real dataset to a matrix.
  Without looking up the indices in an associative array,
  it applies a hash function to the features and uses their hash values as indices directly.
  The method of feature hashing in this package was proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009) <arXiv:0902.2206>.
  The hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 from the 'digest' package.
  Please see the README in <https://github.com/wush978/FeatureHashing> for more information.
