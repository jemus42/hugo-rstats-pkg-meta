  Zero-Inflated Models (ZIM) for Count Time Series with Excess
  Zeros
maintainer: Ming Yang
description: |-
  Analyze count time series with excess zeros.
  Two types of statistical models are supported: Markov regression by Yang et al.
  (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.stamet.2013.02.001> and state-space models by Yang et al.
  (2015) <doi:10.1177/1471082X14535530>. They are also known as observation-driven and
  parameter-driven models respectively in the time series literature. The functions used for
  Markov regression or observation-driven models can also be used to fit ordinary regression models
  with independent data under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)
  assumption. Besides, the package contains some miscellaneous functions to compute density, distribution,
  quantile, and generate random numbers from ZIP and ZINB distributions.
