  Decision Tree Analysis for Probabilistic Subgroup Identification
  with Multiple Treatments
maintainer: Oleg Sysoev
description: |-
  In the situation when multiple alternative treatments or
  interventions available, different population groups may respond differently
  to different treatments. This package implements a method that discovers
  the population subgroups in which a certain treatment has a better effect
  than the other alternative treatments. This is done by first estimating the
  treatment effect for a given treatment and its uncertainty by computing random
  forests, and the resulting model is summarized by a decision tree in which the
  probabilities that the given treatment is best for a given subgroup is shown in
  the corresponding terminal node of the tree.
