title: Constructing and Interacting with Databases of Presentations
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: Provides methods for constructing and maintaining a database of presentations
  in R. The presentations are either ones that the user gives or gave or presentations
  at a particular event or event series. The package also provides a plot method for
  the interactive mapping of the presentations using 'leaflet' by grouping them according
  to country, city, year and other presentation attributes. The markers on the map
  come with popups providing presentation details (title, institution, event, links
  to materials and events, and so on).
