title: Total Variation Denoising
maintainer: Mark Pinese
description: |-
  Total Variation Denoising is a regularized denoising method which
  effectively removes noise from piecewise constant signals whilst preserving
  edges.  This package contains a C++ implementation of Condat's very fast 1D
  squared error loss TVD algorithm.  Additional methods and loss functions may
  be added in future versions.
