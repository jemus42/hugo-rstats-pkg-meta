description: |-
  Testing for heterogeneous effects in a case-control setting.
  The aim here to discover an association that is beyond a mean difference
  between all cases and all controls. Instead, the signal of interest here
  is present in only a proportion of the cases. This test should be more
  powerful than a t-test or Wilcoxon test in this heterogeneous setting.
