title: Fits Piecewise Polynomial with Data-Adaptive Knots in Cox Model
maintainer: Jiacheng Wu
description: In Cox's proportional hazard model, covariates are modeled as linear
  function and may not be flexible. This package implements additive trend filtering
  Cox proportional hazards model as proposed in Jiacheng Wu & Daniela Witten (2019)
  "Flexible and Interpretable Models for Survival Data", Journal of Computational
  and Graphical Statistics, <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2019.1592758>. The fitted functions
  are piecewise polynomial with adaptively chosen knots.
