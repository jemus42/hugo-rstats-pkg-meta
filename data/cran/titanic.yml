title: Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set
maintainer: Paul Hendricks
description: |-
  This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on
  the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic", summarized according
  to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. Whereas the base R
  Titanic data found by calling data("Titanic") is an array resulting from
  cross-tabulating 2201 observations, these data sets are the individual
  non-aggregated observations and formatted in a machine learning context
  with a training sample, a testing sample, and two additional data sets
  that can be used for deeper machine learning analysis. These data sets
  are also the data sets downloaded from the Kaggle competition and thus
  lowers the barrier to entry for users new to R or machine learing.
