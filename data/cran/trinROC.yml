title: Statistical Tests for Assessing Trinormal ROC Data
maintainer: Reinhard Furrer
description: Several statistical test functions as well as a function for exploratory
  data analysis to investigate classifiers allocating individuals to one of three
  disjoint and ordered classes. In a single classifier assessment the discriminatory
  power is compared to classification by chance. In a comparison of two classifiers
  the null hypothesis corresponds to equal discriminatory power of the two classifiers.
