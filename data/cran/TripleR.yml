  Social Relation Model (SRM) Analyses for Single or Multiple
  Groups
maintainer: Felix Sch√∂nbrodt
description: |-
  Social Relation Model (SRM) analyses for single or multiple
  round-robin groups are performed. These analyses are either based on one
  manifest variable, one latent construct measured by two manifest variables,
  two manifest variables and their bivariate relations, or two latent
  constructs each measured by two manifest variables. Within-group t-tests
  for variance components and covariances are provided for single groups.
  For multiple groups two types of significance tests are provided:
  between-groups t-tests (as in SOREMO) and enhanced standard errors based on
  Lashley and Bond (1997) <DOI:10.1037/1082-989X.2.3.278>. Handling for missing values is provided.
