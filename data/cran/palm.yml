title: Fitting Point Process Models via the Palm Likelihood
maintainer: Ben Stevenson
description: Functions to fit point process models using the Palm likelihood. First
  proposed by Tanaka, Ogata, and Stoyan (2008) <DOI:10.1002/bimj.200610339>, maximisation
  of the Palm likelihood can provide computationally efficient parameter estimation
  for point process models in situations where the full likelihood is intractable.
  This package is chiefly focused on Neyman-Scott point processes, but can also fit
  the void processes proposed by Jones-Todd et al. (in press) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8046>.
  The development of this package was motivated by the analysis of capture-recapture
  surveys on which individuals cannot be identified---the data from which can conceptually
  be seen as a clustered point process (Stevenson, Borchers, and Fewster, in press
  <DOI:10.1111/biom.12983>). As such, some of the functions in this package are specifically
  for the estimation of cetacean density from two-camera aerial surveys.
