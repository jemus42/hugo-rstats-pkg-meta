title: Empirical Bayes Ranking
maintainer: John Ferguson
description: Empirical Bayes ranking applicable to parallel-estimation settings where
  the estimated parameters are asymptotically unbiased and normal, with known standard
  errors.  A mixture normal prior for each parameter is estimated using Empirical
  Bayes methods, subsequentially ranks for each parameter are simulated from the resulting
  joint posterior over all parameters (The marginal posterior densities for each parameter
  are assumed independent). Finally, experiments are ordered by expected posterior
  rank, although computations minimizing other plausible rank-loss functions are also
  given.
