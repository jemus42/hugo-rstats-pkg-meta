maintainer: Kabir Khanna

  Predicts individual race/ethnicity using surname, geolocation,
  and other attributes, such as gender and age. The method utilizes the Bayes'
  Rule to compute the posterior probability of each racial category for any given
  individual. The package implements methods described in Imai and Khanna (2015)
  "Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter
  Registration Records" <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001>.
