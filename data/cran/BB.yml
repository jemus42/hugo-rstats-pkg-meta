maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Barzilai-Borwein spectral methods for solving nonlinear
  system of equations, and for optimizing nonlinear objective
  functions subject to simple constraints. A tutorial style
  introduction to this package is available in a vignette on the
  CRAN download page or, when the package is loaded in an R
  session, with vignette("BB").
