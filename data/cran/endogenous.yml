title: Classical Simultaneous Equation Models
maintainer: Andrew J. Spieker
description: Likelihood-based approaches to estimate linear regression parameters
  and treatment effects in the presence of endogeneity. Specifically, this package
  includes James Heckman's classical simultaneous equation models-the sample selection
  model for outcome selection bias and hybrid model with structural shift for endogenous
  treatment. For more information, see the seminal paper of Heckman (1978) <DOI:10.3386/w0177>
  in which the details of these models are provided. This package accommodates repeated
  measures on subjects with a working independence approach. The hybrid model further
  accommodates treatment effect modification.
