version: 0.0.2.0
title: An Imperative Library for Data Manipulation
maintainer: Zach Flynn
description: Implements tools for manipulating data sets and performing regressions
  in a way that is familiar to users of a popular, but proprietary, statistical package
  commonly used in the social sciences. Loads a single dataset into memory and implements
  a set of imperative commands to modify that data and perform regressions and other
  analysis on the dataset. Offers an alternative to standard R's function-based approach
  to data manipulation.
