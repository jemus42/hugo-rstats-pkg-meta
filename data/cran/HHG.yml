  Heller-Heller-Gorfine Tests of Independence and Equality of
  Distributions
maintainer: Barak Brill
description: |-
  Heller-Heller-Gorfine tests are a set of powerful statistical
  tests of multivariate k-sample homogeneity and independence (Heller et. al., 2013, <doi:10.1093/biomet/ass070>). For the univariate
  case, the package also offers implementations of the 'MinP DDP' and 'MinP ADP'
  tests by Heller et. al. (2016), which are consistent against all continuous alternatives but are
  distribution-free, and are thus much faster to apply.
