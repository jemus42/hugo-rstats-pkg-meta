title: Regularized PQL for Joint Selection in GLMMs
maintainer: Francis Hui
description: Performs joint selection in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) using
  penalized likelihood methods. Specifically, the Penalized Quasi-Likelihood (PQL)
  is used as a loss function, and penalties are then augmented to perform simultaneous
  fixed and random effects selection. Regularized PQL avoids the need for integration
  (or approximations such as the Laplace's method) during the estimation process,
  and so the full solution path for model selection can be constructed relatively
  quickly.
