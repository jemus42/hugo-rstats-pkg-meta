title: Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) Tools for Time Series Analysis
maintainer: Jannis v. Buttlar
description: Contains some implementations of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for
  the gapfilling and spectral decomposition of time series. It contains the code used
  by Buttlar et. al. (2014), Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. In addition, the iterative
  SSA gapfilling method of Kondrashov and Ghil (2006) is implemented. All SSA calculations
  are done via the truncated and fast SSA algorithm of Korobeynikov (2010) (package
  'Rssa').
