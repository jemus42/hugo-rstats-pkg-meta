title: Model Averaged Double Robust Estimation
maintainer: Matthew Cefalu
description: Estimates average treatment effects using model average double robust
  (MA-DR) estimation. The MA-DR estimator is defined as weighted average of double
  robust estimators, where each double robust estimator corresponds to a specific
  choice of the outcome model and the propensity score model. The MA-DR estimator
  extend the desirable double robustness property by achieving consistency under the
  much weaker assumption that either the true propensity score model or the true outcome
  model be within a specified, possibly large, class of models.
