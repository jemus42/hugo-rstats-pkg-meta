title: Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm based on R
maintainer: Ming-Chang (Alan) Lee
description: |-
  This package provide functions for box-constrained
  multiobjective optimization using the elitist non-dominated
  sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
  sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated
  binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the
  main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
