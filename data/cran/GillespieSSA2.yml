title: Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for Impatient People
maintainer: Robrecht Cannoodt
description: |-
  A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating large
  systems with Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ('SSA').
  This package is the spiritual successor to the 'GillespieSSA' package
  originally written by Mario Pineda-Krch. Benefits of this package
  include major speed improvements (>100x), easier to understand documentation,
  and many unit tests that try to ensure the package works as intended.
