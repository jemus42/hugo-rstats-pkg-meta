title: Graph-Constrained Estimation and Hypothesis Tests
maintainer: Sen Zhao
description: Use the graph-constrained estimation (Grace) procedure (Zhao and Shojaie,
  2016 <doi:10.1111/biom.12418>) to estimate graph-guided linear regression coefficients
  and use the Grace/GraceI/GraceR tests to perform graph-guided hypothesis tests on
  the association between the response and the predictors.
