  Grain size analysis, textural classifications and distribution
  of unconsolidated sediments
maintainer: Eliandro Ronael Gilbert
description: This package is a port to R of the SysGran program, written in Delphi
  by Camargo (2006). It contains functions for the analysis of grain size samples
  (in logarithmic (phi) and geometric (micrometers) scale) based on various methods,
  like Folk & Ward (1957) and Methods of Moments (Tanner, 1995), among others; textural
  classifications and distribution of unconsolidated sediments are shown in histograms,
  bivariated plots and ternary diagrams of Shepard (1954) and Pejrup (1988). English
  and Portuguese languages are supported in outputs
