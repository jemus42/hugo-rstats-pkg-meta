  The Forward Imputation: A Sequential Distance-Based Approach for
  Imputing Missing Data
maintainer: Alessandro Barbiero
description: Two methods based on the Forward Imputation approach are implemented
  for the imputation of quantitative missing data. One method alternates Nearest Neighbour
  Imputation and Principal Component Analysis (function 'ForImp.PCA'), the other uses
  Nearest Neighbour Imputation with the Mahalanobis distance (function 'ForImp.Mahala').
