title: ODE Generation and Integration
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Generate systems of ordinary differential equations
  (ODE) and integrate them, using a domain specific language
  (DSL).  The DSL uses R's syntax, but compiles to C in order to
  efficiently solve the system.  A solver is not provided, but
  instead interfaces to the packages 'deSolve' and 'dde' are
  generated.  With these, while solving the differential equations,
  no allocations are done and the calculations remain entirely in
  compiled code.  Alternatively, a model can be transpiled to R for
  use in contexts where a C compiler is not present.  After
  compilation, models can be inspected to return information about
  parameters and outputs, or intermediate values after calculations.
  'odin' is not targeted at any particular domain and is suitable
  for any system that can be expressed primarily as mathematical
  expressions.  Additional support is provided for working with
  delays (delay differential equations, DDE), using interpolated
  functions during interpolation, and for integrating quantities
  that represent arrays.
