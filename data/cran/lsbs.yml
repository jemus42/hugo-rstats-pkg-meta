title: Bandwidth Selection for Level Sets and HDR Estimation
maintainer: Guangwei Weng
description: |-
  Bandwidth selection for kernel density estimators of 2-d
  level sets and highest density regions. It applies a plug-in
  strategy to estimate the asymptotic risk function and minimize to
  get the optimal bandwidth matrix. See Doss and Weng (2018)
  <arXiv:1806.00731> for more detail.
