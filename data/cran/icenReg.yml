description: |-
  Regression models for interval censored data. Currently supports
  Cox-PH, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time models. Allows for
  semi and fully parametric models (parametric only for accelerated failure
  time models) and Bayesian parametric models. Includes functions for easy visual
