title: Measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits, and<U+000a>other
  tools for functional ecology
maintainer: Etienne Lalibert√©
description: FD is a package to compute different multidimensional FD indices. It
  implements a distance-based framework to measure FD that allows any number and type
  of functional traits, and can also consider species relative abundances. It also
  contains other useful tools for functional ecology.
