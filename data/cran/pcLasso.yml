maintainer: Rob Tibshirani
description: |-
  A method for fitting the entire regularization path
  of the principal components lasso for linear and
  logistic regression models. The algorithm uses cyclic coordinate descent
  in a path-wise fashion. See URL below for more information on the algorithm.
