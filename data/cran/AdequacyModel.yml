  Adequacy of Probabilistic Models and General Purpose
  Optimization
maintainer: Pedro Rafael Diniz Marinho
description: The main application concerns to a new robust optimization package with
  two major contributions. The first contribution refers to the assessment of the
  adequacy of probabilistic models through a combination of several statistics, which
  measure the relative quality of statistical models for a given data set. The second
  one provides a general purpose optimization method based on meta-heuristics functions
  for maximizing or minimizing an arbitrary objective function.
