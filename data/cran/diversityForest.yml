version: 0.2.0
title: Diversity Forests
maintainer: Roman Hornung
description: |-
  Implements diversity forests as described in an
  upcoming paper by the author of the package.
  This package is a fork of the R package 'ranger' (main author:
  Marvin N. Wright) that implements random forests using an efficient C++
  implementation. More precisely, 'diversityForest' was written by modifying
  the code of 'ranger', version 0.11.0. Therefore, details on further
  functionalities of the code that are not presented in the help pages of
  'diversityForest' are found in the help pages of 'ranger' (version 0.11.0).
  The code in the example sections of the 'diversityForest' manual can be used
  as a template for all basic application scenarios with respect to
  classification, regression and survival prediction using univariate,
  binary splitting. Some function arguments adopted from the 'ranger'
  package are not be useable with diversity forests (for the current
  package version).
