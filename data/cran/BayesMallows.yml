title: Bayesian Preference Learning with the Mallows Rank Model
maintainer: Oystein Sorensen
description: An implementation of the Bayesian version of the Mallows rank model (Vitelli
  et al., Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2018 <http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-481.html>;
  Crispino et al., to appear in Annals of Applied Statistics). Both Cayley, footrule,
  Hamming, Kendall, Spearman, and Ulam distances are supported in the models. The
  rank data to be analyzed can be in the form of complete rankings, top-k rankings,
  partially missing rankings, as well as consistent and inconsistent pairwise preferences.
  Several functions for plotting and studying the posterior distributions of parameters
  are provided. The package also provides functions for estimating the partition function
  (normalizing constant) of the Mallows rank model, both with the importance sampling
  algorithm of Vitelli et al. and asymptotic approximation with the IPFP algorithm
  (Mukherjee, Annals of Statistics, 2016 <doi:10.1214/15-AOS1389>).
