maintainer: Melchior Burri
description: |-
  Plots survival models from the 'survival' package. Additionally, it
  plots curves of multistate models from the 'mstate' package. Typically, a
  plot is drawn by the sequence survplot(), confIntArea(), survCurve() and
  nrAtRisk(). The separation of the plot in this 4 functions allows for great
  flexibility to make a custom plot for publication.
