maintainer: Mingyi Jiang
description: |-
  Implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation engine for valuing synthetic portfolios of
  variable annuities, which reflect realistic features of common annuity contracts in practice.
  It aims to facilitate the development and dissemination of research related to the efficient
  valuation of a portfolio of large variable annuities. The main valuation methodology was
  proposed by Gan (2017) <doi:10.1515/demo-2017-0021>.
