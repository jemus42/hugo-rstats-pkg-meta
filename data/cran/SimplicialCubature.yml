maintainer: John P. Nolan
description: |-
  Provides methods to integrate functions over m-dimensional simplices
  in n-dimensional Euclidean space.  There are exact methods for polynomials and
  adaptive methods for integrating an arbitrary function.  Dirichlet probabilities
  are calculated in certain cases.
