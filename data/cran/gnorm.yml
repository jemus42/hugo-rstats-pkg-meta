maintainer: Maryclare Griffin
description: Functions for obtaining generalized normal/exponential power distribution
  probabilities, quantiles, densities and random deviates. The generalized normal/exponential
  power distribution was introduced by Subbotin (1923) and rediscovered by Nadarajah
  (2005). The parametrization given by Nadarajah (2005) <doi:10.1080/02664760500079464>
  is used.
