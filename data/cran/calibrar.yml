title: Automated Parameter Estimation for Complex (Ecological) Models
maintainer: Ricardo Oliveros-Ramos
description: |-
  Automated parameter estimation for complex (ecological) models in R.
  This package allows the parameter estimation or calibration of complex models,
  including stochastic ones. It is a generic tool that can be used for fitting
  any type of models, especially those with non-differentiable objective functions.
  It supports multiple phases and constrained optimization.
  It implements maximum likelihood estimation methods and automated construction
  of the objective function from simulated model outputs.
