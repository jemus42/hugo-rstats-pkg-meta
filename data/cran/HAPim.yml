description: |-
  The package provides a set of functions whose aim is to
  propose 4 methods of QTL detection. HAPimLD is an
  interval-mapping method designed for unrelated individuals with
  no family information that makes use of linkage disequilibrium.
  HAPimLDL is an interval-mapping method for design of half-sib
  families. It combines linkage analysis and linkage
  disequilibrium. HaploMax is based on an analysis of variance
  with a dose haplotype effect. HaploMaxHS is based on an
  analysis of variance with a sire effect and a dose haplotype
  effect in half-sib family design.  Fundings for the package
  development were provided to the LDLmapQTL project by the ANR
  GENANIMAL program and APIS-GENE.
