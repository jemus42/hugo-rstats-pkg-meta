  Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Animal Movement Behavior Using
  Multivariate Hidden Markov Models
maintainer: Brett McClintock
description: Extended tools for analyzing telemetry data using generalized hidden
  Markov models. Features of momentuHMM (pronounced ``momentum'') include data pre-processing
  and visualization, fitting HMMs to location and auxiliary biotelemetry or environmental
  data, biased and correlated random walk movement models, hierarchical HMMs, multiple
  imputation for incorporating location measurement error and missing data, user-specified
  design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters, random effects,
  decoding of the state process, visualization of fitted models, model checking and
  selection, and simulation. See McClintock and Michelot (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12995>.
