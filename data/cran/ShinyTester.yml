title: Functions to Minimize Bonehead Moves While Working with 'shiny'
maintainer: Amit Kohli
description: |-
  It's my experience that working with 'shiny' is intuitive once you're
  into it, but can be quite daunting at first. Several common mistakes are fairly
  predictable, and therefore we can control for these. The functions in this
  package help match up the assets listed in the UI and the SERVER files, and
  Visualize the ad hoc structure of the 'shiny' App.
