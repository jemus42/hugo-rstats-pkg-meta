title: Finds the Price of Anarchy for Routing Games
maintainer: Hector Haffenden
description: Computes the optimal flow, Nash flow and the Price of Anarchy for any
  routing game defined within the game theoretical framework. The input is a routing
  game in the form of itâ€™s cost and flow functions. Then transforms this into an optimisation
  problem, allowing both Nash and Optimal flows to be solved by nonlinear optimisation.
