title: Dynamic Simulation and Testing for Single-Equation ARDL Models
maintainer: Soren Jordan
description: While autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models allow for extremely
  flexible dynamics, interpreting substantive significance of complex lag structures
  remains difficult. This package is designed to assist users in dynamically simulating
  and plotting the results of various ARDL models. It also contains post-estimation
  diagnostics, including a test for cointegration when estimating the error-correction
  variant of the autoregressive distributed lag model (Pesaran, Shin, and Smith 2001
  <doi:10.1002/jae.616>).
