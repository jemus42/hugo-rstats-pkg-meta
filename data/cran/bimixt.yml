title: Estimates Mixture Models for Case-Control Data
maintainer: Michelle Winerip
description: Estimates non-Gaussian mixture models of case-control data. The four
  types of models supported are binormal, two component constrained, two component
  unconstrained, and four component.  The most general model is the four component
  model, under which both cases and controls are distributed according to a mixture
  of two unimodal distributions.  In the four component model, the two component distributions
  of the control mixture may be distinct from the two components of the case mixture
  distribution.  In the two component unconstrained model, the components of the control
  and case mixtures are the same; however the mixture probabilities may differ for
  cases and controls.  In the two component constrained model, all controls are distributed
  according to one of the two components while cases follow a mixture distribution
  of the two components.  In the binormal model, cases and controls are distributed
  according to distinct unimodal distributions.  These models assume that Box-Cox
  transformed case and control data with a common lambda parameter are distributed
  according to Gaussian mixture distributions.   Model parameters are estimated using
  the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  Likelihood ratio test comparison of
  nested models can be performed using the lr.test function. AUC and PAUC values can
  be computed for the model-based and empirical ROC curves using the auc and pauc
  functions, respectively. The model-based and empirical ROC curves can be graphed
  using the roc.plot function. Finally, the model-based density estimates can be visualized
  by plotting a model object created with the bimixt.model function.
