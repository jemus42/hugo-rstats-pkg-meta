title: methods of distance-based gene set functional enrichment<U+000a>analysis.
maintainer: Li Jin
description: This package provides methods and examples to support a<U+000a>method
  of Gene Set Analysis (GSA).  DBGSA is a novel<U+000a>distance-based gene set enrichment
  analysis method. We consider<U+000a>that, the distance between 2 groups with different
  phenotype by<U+000a>focusing on the gene expression should be larger, if a certain<U+000a>gene
  functional set was significantly associated with a<U+000a>particular phenotype.
