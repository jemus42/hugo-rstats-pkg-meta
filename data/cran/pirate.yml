title: Generated Effect Modifier
maintainer: Zhe Su
description: 'An implementation of the generated effect modifier (GEM) method. This
  method constructs composite variables by linearly combining pre-treatment scalar
  patient characteristics to create optimal treatment effect modifiers in linear models.
  The optimal linear combination is called a GEM. Treatment is assumed to have been
  assigned at random. For reference, see E Petkova, T Tarpey, Z Su, and RT Ogden.
