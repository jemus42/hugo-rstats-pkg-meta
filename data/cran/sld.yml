  Estimation and Use of the Quantile-Based Skew Logistic
  Distribution
maintainer: Robert King
description: |-
  The skew logistic distribution is a quantile-defined generalisation
  of the logistic distribution (van Staden and King 2015).  Provides random
  numbers, quantiles, probabilities, densities and density quantiles for the distribution.
  It provides Quantile-Quantile plots and method of L-Moments estimation
  (including asymptotic standard errors) for the distribution.
