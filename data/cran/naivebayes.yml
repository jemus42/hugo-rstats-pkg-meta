title: High Performance Implementation of the Naive Bayes Algorithm
maintainer: Michal Majka
description: 'In this implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier following class
  conditional distributions are available: Bernoulli, Categorical, Gaussian, Poisson
  and non-parametric representation of the class conditional density estimated via
  Kernel Density Estimation. Implemented classifiers handle missing data and can take
  advantage of sparse data.'
