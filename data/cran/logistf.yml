title: Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression
maintainer: Georg Heinze
description: |-
  Fit a logistic regression model using Firth's bias reduction method, equivalent to penalization of the log-likelihood by the Jeffreys
  prior. Confidence intervals for regression coefficients can be computed by penalized profile likelihood. Firth's method was proposed as ideal
  solution to the problem of separation in logistic regression. If needed, the bias reduction can be turned off such that ordinary
  maximum likelihood logistic regression is obtained.
