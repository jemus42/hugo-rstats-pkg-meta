  Hierarchical Models for Parametric and Semi-Parametric Analyses
  of Semi-Competing Risks Data
maintainer: Kyu Ha Lee
description: 'Hierarchical multistate models are considered to perform the analysis
  of independent/clustered semi-competing risks data. The package allows to choose
  the specification for model components from a range of options giving users substantial
  flexibility, including: accelerated failure time or proportional hazards regression
  models; parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline survival functions
  and cluster-specific random effects distribution; a Markov or semi-Markov specification
  for terminal event following non-terminal event. While estimation is mainly performed
  within the Bayesian paradigm, the package also provides the maximum likelihood estimation
  approach for several parametric models. The package also includes functions for
  univariate survival analysis as complementary analysis tools.'
