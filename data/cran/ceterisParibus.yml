  Ceteris Paribus Profiles (What-If Plots) are designed to present model
  responses around selected points in a feature space.
  For example around a single prediction for an interesting observation.
  Plots are designed to work in a model-agnostic fashion, they are working
  for any predictive Machine Learning model and allow for model comparisons.
  Ceteris Paribus Plots supplement the Break Down Plots from 'breakDown' package.
