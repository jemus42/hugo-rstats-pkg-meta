title: Bayesian Analysis of Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Models
maintainer: Daniel Turek
description: Enables off-the-shelf functionality for fully Bayesian, nonstationary
  Gaussian process modeling. The approach to nonstationary modeling involves a closed-form,
  convolution-based covariance function with spatially-varying parameters; these parameter
  processes can be specified either deterministically (using covariates or basis functions)
  or stochastically (using approximate Gaussian processes). Stationary Gaussian processes
  are a special case of our methodology, and we furthermore implement approximate
  Gaussian process inference to account for very large spatial data sets (Finley,
  et al (2017) <arXiv:1702.00434v2>). Bayesian inference is carried out using Markov
  chain Monte Carlo methods via the 'nimble' package, and posterior prediction for
  the Gaussian process at unobserved locations is provided as a post-processing step.
