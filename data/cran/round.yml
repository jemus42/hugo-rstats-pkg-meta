title: Rounding to Decimal Digits
maintainer: Martin Maechler
description: |-
  Decimal rounding is non-trivial in binary arithmetic.  ISO
  standard round to even is more rare than typically assumed as most decimal fractions
  are not exactly representable in binary.  Our roundX() versions explore differences
  between current and potential future versions of round() in R.
  Further, provides (some partly related) C99 math lib functions not in base R.
