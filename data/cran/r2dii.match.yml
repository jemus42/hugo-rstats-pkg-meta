title: Tools to Match Financial Portfolios with Climate Data
maintainer: Mauro Lepore
description: |-
  These tools implement in R a fundamental part of
  the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
  which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
  portfolios and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
  Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
  allocation impacts the climate. This package matches data from
  financial portfolios to asset level data from market-intelligence
  databases (e.g. power plant capacities, emission factors, etc.). This
  is the first step to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with
  climate goals.
