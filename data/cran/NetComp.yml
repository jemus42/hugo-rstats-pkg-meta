description: |-
  This package contains functions to carry out high
  throughput data analysis and to conduct data set comparisons.
  Similarity matrices from high throughput phenotypic data
  containing uninformative (e.g. wild type) or missing data can
  be calculated to report similarity of response.  A suite of
  graph comparisons using an adjacency or correlation matrix
  format are included to facilitate quick network analysis.
