title: Fundamental Clustering Problems Suite
maintainer: Michael Thrun
description: 'Many conventional clustering algorithms are provided in this package
  with consistent input and output, which enables the user to try out algorithms swiftly.
  Additionally, 26 statistical approaches for the estimation of the number of clusters
  as well as the the mirrored density plot (MD-plot) of clusterability are implemented.
  Moreover, the fundamental clustering problems suite (FCPS) offers a variety of clustering
  challenges any algorithm should handle when facing real world data, see Thrun, M.C.,

  Problems" (2020), Data in Brief, <DOI:10.1016/j.dib.2020.105501>.'
