title: Bayesian Estimation of Incoherent Neutron Scattering Backgrounds
maintainer: Anton Gagin
description: |-
  We implemented a Bayesian-statistics approach for
  subtraction of incoherent scattering from neutron total-scattering data.
  In this approach, the estimated background signal associated with
  incoherent scattering maximizes the posterior probability, which combines
  the likelihood of this signal in reciprocal and real spaces with the prior
  that favors smooth lines.
