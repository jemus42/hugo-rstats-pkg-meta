  A SINful Approach to Selection of Gaussian Graphical Markov
  Models
maintainer: Mathias Drton
description: |-
  This package provides routines to perform SIN model selection
  as described in Drton & Perlman (2004, 2008).  The selected models are
  represented in the format of the 'ggm' package, which allows in
  particular parameter estimation in the selected model.
