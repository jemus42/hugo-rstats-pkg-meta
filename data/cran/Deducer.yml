title: A Data Analysis GUI for R
maintainer: Ian Fellows
description: An intuitive, cross-platform graphical data analysis system. It uses
  menus and dialogs to guide the user efficiently through the data manipulation and
  analysis process, and has an excel like spreadsheet for easy data frame visualization
  and editing. Deducer works best when used with the Java based R GUI JGR, but the
  dialogs can be called from the command line. Dialogs have also been integrated into
  the Windows Rgui.
