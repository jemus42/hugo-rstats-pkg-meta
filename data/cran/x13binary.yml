maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The US Census Bureau provides a seasonal adjustment program now
  called 'X-13ARIMA-SEATS' building on both earlier programs called X-11 and
  X-12 as well as the SEATS program by the Bank of Spain. The US Census Bureau
  offers both source and binary versions -- which this package integrates for
  use by other R packages.
