title: Distance Measures for Time Series Data
maintainer: Usue Mori
description: A set of commonly used distance measures and some additional functions
  which, although initially not designed for this purpose, can be used to measure
  the dissimilarity between time series. These measures can be used to perform clustering,
  classification or other data mining tasks which require the definition of a distance
  measure between time series.
