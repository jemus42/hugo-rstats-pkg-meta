title: Prediction-Based Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis

description: |-
  A tool for inferring kinase activity changes from
  phosphoproteomics data. 'pKSEA' uses kinase-substrate
  prediction scores to weight observed changes in
  phosphopeptide abundance to calculate a phosphopeptide-level
  contribution score, then sums up these contribution scores by
  kinase to obtain a phosphoproteome-level kinase activity
  change score (KAC score). 'pKSEA' then assesses the
  significance of changes in predicted substrate abundances for
  each kinase using permutation testing. This results in a
  permutation score (pKSEA significance score) reflecting the
  likelihood of a similarly high or low KAC from random chance,
  which can then be interpreted in an analogous manner to an
  empirically calculated p-value. 'pKSEA' contains default
  databases of kinase-substrate predictions from 'NetworKIN'
