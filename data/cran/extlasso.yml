title: Maximum penalized likelihood estimation with extended lasso<U+000a>penalty
maintainer: B N Mandal
description: The package estimates coefficients of extended LASSO penalized linear
  regression and generalized linear models. Currently lasso and elastic net penalized
  linear regression and generalized linear models are considered. The package currently
  utilizes an accurate approximation of L1 penalty and then a modified Jacobi algorithm
  to estimate the coefficients. There is provision for plotting of the solutions and
  predictions of coefficients at given values of lambda. The package also contains
  functions for cross validation to select a suitable lambda value given the data.
  The package also provides a function for estimation in fused lasso penalized linear
  regression.
