  Algorithm for Searching the Space of Gaussian Directed Acyclic
  Graph Models Through Moment Fractional Bayes Factors
maintainer: Davide Altomare
description: 'We propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching the space of
  Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. The algorithm proposed makes use of
  moment fractional Bayes factors (MFBF) and thus it is suitable for learning sparse
  graph. The algorithm is implemented by using Armadillo: an open-source C++ linear
  algebra library.'
