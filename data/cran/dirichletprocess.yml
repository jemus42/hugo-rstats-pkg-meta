title: Build Dirichlet Process Objects for Bayesian Modelling
maintainer: Dean Markwick
description: |-
  Perform nonparametric Bayesian analysis using Dirichlet
  processes without the need to program the inference algorithms.
  Utilise included pre-built models or specify custom
  models and allow the 'dirichletprocess' package to handle the
  Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
  Our Dirichlet process objects can act as building blocks for a variety
  of statistical models including and not limited to: density estimation,
  clustering and prior distributions in hierarchical models.
