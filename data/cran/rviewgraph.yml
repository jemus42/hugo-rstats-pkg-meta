title: Animated Graph Layout Viewer
maintainer: Alun Thomas
description: |-
  This is an 'R' interface to Alun Thomas's 'ViewGraph' 'Java' graph
  viewing program.
  It takes a graph specified as an incidence matrix, list of
  edges, or in 'igraph' format and runs a graphical user interface that shows
  an animation of a force directed algorithm positioning the vertices in two
  dimensions. It works well for graphs of various structure of up to a few
  thousand vertices. It's not fazed by graphs that comprise several
  components. The coordinates can be read as an 'igraph' style layout
  matrix at any time. The user can mess with the layout using a mouse,
  preferably one with 3 buttons, and some keyed commands.
