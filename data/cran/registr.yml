title: Curve Registration for Exponential Family Functional Data
maintainer: Julia Wrobel
description: |-
  A method for registering curves (functional data) that are generated from exponential family distributions.  This
  implements the algorithms described in 'Wrobel et al. (2019)' <doi:10.1111/biom.12963>. Curve registration is an active area of
  research in functional data analysis, and can be used to better understand patterns in functional data by separating curves
  into phase and amplitude variability. This software handles both binary and continuous functional data, and is
  especially applicable in accelerometry and wearable technology.
