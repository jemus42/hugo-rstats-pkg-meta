title: Algorithms for Matching Bullet Lands
maintainer: Eric Hare
description: |-
  Analyze bullet lands using nonparametric methods. We provide a
  reading routine for x3p files (see <http://www.openfmc.org> for more
  information) and a host of analysis functions designed to assess the
  probability that two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel.
