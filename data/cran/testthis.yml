description: |-
  Utility functions and 'RStudio' addins for writing,
  running and organizing automated tests. Integrates tightly with the
  packages 'testthat', 'devtools' and 'usethis'.  Hotkeys can be
  assigned to the 'RStudio' addins for running tests in a single file or
  to switch between a source file and the associated test file. In
  addition, testthis provides function to manage and run tests in
  subdirectories of the test/testthat directory.
