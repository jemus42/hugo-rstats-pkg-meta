title: Bindings for 'Mapbox' Ear Cutting Triangulation Library
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Provides constrained triangulation of polygons. Ear cutting (or
  ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively 'cutting'
  triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are supported by introducing
  a bridge segment between polygon paths. This package wraps the 'header-only'
  library 'earcut.hpp' <https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.git> which includes
  a reference to the method used by Held, M. (2001) <doi:10.1007/s00453-001-0028-4>.
