  Functions for the implementation of Independent Multiple-sample
  Greedy Equivalence Search (IMaGES), a causal inference algorithm for creating
  aggregate graphs and structural equation modeling data for one or more
  datasets. This package is useful for time series data with specific regions of
  interest. This implementation is inspired by the paper "Six problems
  for causal inference from fMRI" by Ramsey, Hanson, Hanson, Halchenko, Poldrack,
  and Glymour (2010) <DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.08.065>. The IMaGES algorithm uses a modified BIC score to compute goodness
  of fit of edge additions, subtractions, and turns across all datasets and
  returns a representative graph, along with structural equation modeling data for
  the global graph and individual datasets, means, and standard errors. Functions
  for plotting the resulting graph(s) are provided. This package is built upon the
  'pcalg' package.
