  Calculate efficiencies of group testing algorithms with
  correlated responses
maintainer: Sam Lendle
description: |-
  This package provides functions to calculate the
  efficiencies (expected tests per unit) of hierarchical and
  matrix group testing procedures.  Efficiencies can be
  calculated in the presense of correlated responses under
  multiple arrangements of clustesrs.  Efficiencies can also be
  evaluated in the presense of test error.
