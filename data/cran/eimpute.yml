title: Efficiently Impute Large Scale Incomplete Matrix
maintainer: Zhe Gao
description: Efficiently impute large scale matrix with missing values via its unbiased
  low-rank matrix approximation. Our main approach is Hard-Impute algorithm proposed
  in <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/mazumder10a.html>, which achieves highly computational
  advantage by truncated singular-value decomposition.
