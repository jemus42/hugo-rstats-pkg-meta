title: Useful Functions for Ridit Analysis
maintainer: Eric Bohlman
description: |-
  Functions to compute ridit scores of vectors, compute mean ridits
  and their standard errors for vectors compared to a reference vector,
  as described in Fleiss (1981, ISBN:0-471-06428-9), and compute
  means/SEs for multiple groups in matrices. Data can be either
  counts or proportions. Emphasis is on ridit analysis of ordered categorical
  data such as Likert items and pain-rating scales.
