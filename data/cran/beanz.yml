title: Bayesian Analysis of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect
maintainer: Chenguang Wang
description: |-
  It is vital to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects
  (HTE) when making health care decisions for an individual patient or a group
  of patients. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to evaluate HTE based
  on information collected from clinical studies that are often designed and
  conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for the overall population.
  The Bayesian framework offers a principled and flexible approach to estimate
  and compare treatment effects across subgroups of patients defined by their
  characteristics. This package allows users to explore a wide range of Bayesian
  HTE analysis models, and produce posterior inferences about HTE. See Wang et al.
