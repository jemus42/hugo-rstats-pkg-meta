title: Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Networks in R
maintainer: Felix Henninger
description: |-
  Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) models are an increasingly
  common class of models in Psychology, with applications to reading and word
  recognition (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981), judgment and decision making
  (Glöckner & Betsch, 2008; Glöckner, Hilbig, & Jekel, 2014), and several
  other fields (e.g. Read, Vanman, & Miller, 1997). In each of these fields,
  they provide a quantitative model of psychological phenomena, with precise
  predictions regarding choice probabilities, decision times, and often the degree
  of confidence. This package provides the necessary functions to create and
  simulate basic Parallel Constraint Satisfaction networks within R.
