  Vegetation Phenological Cycle and Anomaly Detection using Remote
  Sensing Data
maintainer: Roberto O. Ch√°vez
description: |-
  Calculates phenological cycle and anomalies using a non-parametric
  approach applied to time series of vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data
  or field measurements. The package implements basic and high-level functions for
  manipulating vector data (numerical series) and raster data (satellite derived products).
  Processing of very large raster files is supported.
