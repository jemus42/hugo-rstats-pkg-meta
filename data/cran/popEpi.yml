title: Functions for Epidemiological Analysis using Population Data
maintainer: Joonas Miettinen
description: |-
  Enables computation of epidemiological statistics, including those
  where counts or mortality rates of the reference population are used.
  Currently supported: excess hazard models, rates, mean survival times,
  relative survival, and standardized incidence and mortality ratios
  (SIRs/SMRs), all of which can be easily adjusted for by covariates such as
  age. Fast splitting and aggregation of 'Lexis' objects (from package 'Epi')
  and other computations achieved using 'data.table'.
