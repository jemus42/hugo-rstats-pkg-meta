title: Individual Conditional Expectation Plot Toolbox
maintainer: Adam Kapelner
description: Implements Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for
  visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. ICE plots
  refine Friedman's partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship
  between the predicted response and a covariate of interest for individual observations.
  Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the
  range of a covariate of interest, suggesting where and to what extent they may exist.
