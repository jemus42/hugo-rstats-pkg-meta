title: Spatial Designs for Ecological and Environmental Surveys
maintainer: Scott Foster
description: Provides spatially balanced designs from a set of (contiguous) potential
  sampling locations in a study region for point-based and for transect-based surveys.
  Accommodates, without detrimental effects on spatial balance, sites that the researcher
  wishes to include in the survey for reasons other than the current randomisation
  (legacy sites).
