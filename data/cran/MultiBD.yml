title: Multivariate Birth-Death Processes
maintainer: Marc A. Suchard
description: |-
  Computationally efficient functions to provide direct likelihood-based
  inference for partially-observed multivariate birth-death processes.  Such processes
  range from a simple Yule model to the complex susceptible-infectious-removed model
  in disease dynamics.  Efficient likelihood evaluation facilitates maximum likelihood
  estimation and Bayesian inference.
