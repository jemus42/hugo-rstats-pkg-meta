title: Rank Normal Transformation Omnibus Test
maintainer: Zachary McCaw
description: 'Genetic association tests that use the rank-based inverse normal transformation
  (INT). These tests are recommend for continuous traits with non-normally distributed
  residuals. INT-based tests robustly control the type I error in settings where standard
  linear regression does not. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate standard linear regression
  in terms of power. INT-based tests may be classified into two types: tests that
  directly transform the phenotype (D-INT) and tests that transform phenotypic residuals
  (I-INT). Our omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT and I-INT into a single
  robust and statistically powerful approach.'
