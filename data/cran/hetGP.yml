  Heteroskedastic Gaussian Process Modeling and Design under
  Replication
maintainer: Mickael Binois
description: Performs Gaussian process regression with heteroskedastic noise following
  Binois, M., Gramacy, R., Ludkovski, M. (2016) <arXiv:1611.05902>. The input dependent
  noise is modeled as another Gaussian process. Replicated observations are encouraged
  as they yield computational savings. Sequential design procedures based on the integrated
  mean square prediction error and lookahead heuristics are provided, and notably
  fast update functions when adding new observations.
