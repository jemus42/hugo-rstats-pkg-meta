title: Statistical Learning Based Estimation of Mutual Information
maintainer: Tomasz Jetka
description: The implementation of the algorithm for estimation of mutual information
  and channel capacity from experimental data by classification procedures (logistic
  regression). Technically, it allows to estimate information-theoretic measures between
  finite-state input and multivariate, continuous output. Method described in Jetka
  et al. (2019) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007132>.
