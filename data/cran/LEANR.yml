  Finds "Local Subnetworks" Within an Interaction Network which
  Show Enrichment for Differentially Expressed Genes

description: |-
  Implements the method described in "Network-based analysis of omics data: The LEAN method" [Gwinner Boulday (2016) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw676>]
  Given a protein interaction network and a list of p-values describing a measure of interest (as e.g. differential gene expression) this method
  computes an enrichment p-value for the protein neighborhood of each gene and compares it to a background distribution of randomly drawn p-values.
  The resulting scores are corrected for multiple testing and significant hits are returned in tabular format.
