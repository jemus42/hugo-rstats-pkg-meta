version: 0.1.0
title: Reproducible Data Embedding
maintainer: Stefan Kloppenborg
description: |-
  Allows caching of raw data directly in R code. This allows R
  scripts and R Notebooks to be shared and re-run on a machine without access
  to the original data. Cached data is encoded into an ASCII string that can
  be pasted into R code. When the code is run, the data is automatically
  loaded from the cached version if the original data file is unavailable.
  Works best for small datasets (a few hundred observations).
