title: Tools for Discrete Multivariate Mixed Membership Models
maintainer: Y. Samuel Wang
description: |-
  Fits mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with
  or without repeated measures) following the general framework of Erosheva et al
  (2004). This package uses a Variational EM approach by approximating the
  posterior distribution of latent memberships and selecting hyperparameters
  through a pseudo-MLE procedure. Currently supported data types are
  Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce). The extended GoM model with fixed stayers from Erosheva et al     (2007) is now also supported. See Airoldi et al (2014) for other examples of mixed membership models.
