version: 0.1.0
title: Simplified Language for Plots and Charts
maintainer: Rohail Syed
description: 'Provides a very simple syntax for the user to generate custom plot(s)
  without having to remember complicated ''ggplot2'' syntax. The ''chartql'' package
  uses ''ggplot2'' and manages all the syntax complexities internally. As an example,
  to generate a bar chart of company sales faceted by product category further faceted
  by season of the year, we simply write: "CHART bar X category, season Y sales".'
