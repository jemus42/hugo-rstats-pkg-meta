title: 'GUI Tools Made Easy: Interact with Models and Explore Data'
maintainer: Rowan Haigh
description: |-
  Provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation
  of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to
  construct and edit a customized graphical user interface ('GUI'). Although our
  simplified 'GUI' language depends heavily on the R interface to the 'Tcl/Tk'
  package, a user does not need to know 'Tcl/Tk'. Examples illustrate models
  built with other R packages, including 'PBSmapping', 'PBSddesolve', and 'BRugs'.
  A complete user's guide 'PBSmodelling-UG.pdf' shows how to use this package
  effectively.
