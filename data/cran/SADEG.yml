title: Stability Analysis in Differentially Expressed Genes
maintainer: Babak Khorsand
description: We analyzed the nucleotide composition of genes with a special emphasis
  on stability of DNA sequences. Besides, in a variety of different organisms unequal
  use of synonymous codons, or codon usage bias, occurs which also show variation
  among genes in the same genome. Seemingly, codon usage bias is affected by both
  selective constraints and mutation bias which allows and enables us to examine and
  detect changes in these two evolutionary forces between genomes or along one genome.
  Therefore, we determined the codon adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons
  (ENC) and codon usage analysis with calculation of the relative synonymous codon
  usage (RSCU), and subsequently predicted the translation efficiency and accuracy
  through GC-rich codon usages. Furthermore, we estimated the relative stability of
  the DNA sequence following calculation of the average free energy (Delta G) and
  Dimer base-stacking energy level.
