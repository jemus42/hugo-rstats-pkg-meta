title: Utilities for Financial Years
maintainer: Hugh Parsonage
description: |-
  In Australia, a financial year (or fiscal year) is the period from 1 July to 30 June
  of the following calendar year. As such, many databases need to represent and
  validate financial years efficiently. While the use of integer years with a convention that
  they represent the year ending is common, it may lead to ambiguity with calendar years.
  On the other hand, string representations may be too inefficient and do not easily admit
  arithmetic operations. This package tries to make validation of financial years quicker while
  retaining clarity.
