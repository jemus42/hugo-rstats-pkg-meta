version: 1.0.9
title: Generalized Synthetic Control Method
maintainer: Yiqing Xu
description: 'Provides causal inference with interactive fixed-effect models. It imputes
  counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a
  linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts
  interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method generalizes the synthetic
  control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods,
  and improves efficiency and interpretability. This version supports unbalanced panels
  and implements the matrix completion method. Main reference: Yiqing Xu (2017) <doi:10.1017/pan.2016.2>.'
