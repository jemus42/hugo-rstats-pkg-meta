maintainer: Ye Henry Li
description: Implements partition-assisted clustering and multiple alignments of networks.
  It 1) utilizes partition-assisted clustering to find robust and accurate clusters
  and 2) discovers coherent relationships of clusters across multiple samples. It
  is particularly useful for analyzing single-cell data set. Please see Li et al.
