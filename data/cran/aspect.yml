  A General Framework for Multivariate Analysis with Optimal
  Scaling
maintainer: Patrick Mair
description: Contains various functions for optimal scaling. One function performs
  optimal scaling by maximizing an aspect (i.e. a target function such as the sum
  of eigenvalues, sum of squared correlations, squared multiple correlations, etc.)
  of the corresponding correlation matrix. Another function performs implements the
  LINEALS approach for optimal scaling by minimization of an aspect based on pairwise
  correlations and correlation ratios. The resulting correlation matrix and category
  scores can be used for further multivariate methods such as structural equation
  models.
