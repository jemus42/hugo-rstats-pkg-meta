title: Manipulation Testing Based on Density Discontinuity
maintainer: Xinwei Ma
description: 'Density discontinuity test (a.k.a. manipulation test) is commonly employed
  in regression discontinuity designs and other program evaluation settings to detect
  whether there is evidence of perfect self-selection (manipulation) around a cutoff
  where a treatment/policy assignment changes. This package provides tools for conducting
  the aforementioned statistical test: rddensity() to construct local polynomial based
  density discontinuity test given a prespecified cutoff, rdbwdensity() to perform
  bandwidth selection, and rdplotdensity() to construct density plot near the cutoff.'
