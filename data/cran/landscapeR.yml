title: Categorical Landscape Simulation Facility
maintainer: Dario Masante
description: Simulates categorical maps on actual geographical realms, starting from
  either empty landscapes or landscapes provided by the user (e.g. land use maps).
  Allows to tweak or create landscapes while retaining a high degree of control on
  its features, without the hassle of specifying each location attribute. In this
  it differs from other tools which generate null or neutral landscapes in a theoretical
  space. The basic algorithm currently implemented uses a simple agent style/cellular
  automata growth model, with no rules (apart from areas of exclusion) and von Neumann
  neighbourhood (four cells, aka Rook case). Outputs are raster dataset exportable
  to any common GIS format.
