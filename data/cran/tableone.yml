title: Create 'Table 1' to Describe Baseline Characteristics
maintainer: Kazuki Yoshida
description: |-
  Creates 'Table 1', i.e., description of baseline patient
  characteristics, which is essential in every medical research.
  Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as
  p-values and standardized mean differences. Weighted data are
  supported via the 'survey' package. See 'github' for a screen cast.
  'tableone' was inspired by descriptive statistics functions in
  'Deducer' , a Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package
  does not require GUI or Java, and intended for command-line users.
