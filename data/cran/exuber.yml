title: Econometric Analysis of Explosive Time Series
maintainer: Kostas Vasilopoulos
description: |-
  Testing for and dating periods of explosive
  dynamics (exuberance) in time series using the univariate and panel
  recursive unit root tests proposed by Phillips et al. (2015)
  <doi:10.1111/iere.12132> and Pavlidis et al. (2016)
  <doi:10.1007/s11146-015-9531-2>.  The recursive least-squares
  algorithm utilizes the matrix inversion lemma to avoid matrix
  inversion which results in significant speed improvements. Simulation
  of a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble processes.
