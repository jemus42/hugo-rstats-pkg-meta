title: Small Area Estimation for Count Data
maintainer: Rizki Ananda Fauziah
description: Provides small area estimation for count data type and gives option whether
  to use covariates in the estimation or not. By implementing Empirical Bayes (EB)
  Poisson-Gamma model, each function returns EB estimators and mean squared error
  (MSE) estimators for each area. The EB estimators without covariates are obtained
  using the model proposed by Clayton & Kaldor (1987) <doi:10.2307/2532003>, the EB
  estimators with covariates are obtained using the model proposed by Wakefield (2006)
  <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxl008> and the MSE estimators are obtained using Jackknife
  method by Jiang et. al. (2002) <doi:10.1214/aos/1043351257>.
