title: Modelling Heterogeneity in Paired Comparison Data
maintainer: Gunther Schauberger
description: Performs 'BTLLasso' as described by Schauberger and Tutz (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i09>
  and Schauberger and Tutz (2017) <doi:10.1177/1471082X17693086>. BTLLasso is a method
  to include different types of variables in paired comparison models and, therefore,
  to allow for heterogeneity between subjects. Variables can be subject-specific,
  object-specific and subject-object-specific and can have an influence on the attractiveness/strength
  of the objects. Suitable L1 penalty terms are used to cluster certain effects and
  to reduce the complexity of the models.
