  Personalized Repeated Measurement Design for Phase I Clinical
  Trials
maintainer: Lu Zhang
description: |-
  Implements Bayesian phase I repeated measurement design that
  accounts for multidimensional toxicity endpoints and longitudinal efficacy
  measure from multiple treatment cycles. The package provides flags to
  fit a variety of model-based phase I design, including 1 stage models with
  or without individualized dose modification, 3-stage models with or without
  individualized dose modification, etc. Functions are provided to recommend
  dosage selection based on the data collected in the available patient cohorts
  and to simulate trial characteristics given design parameters.
