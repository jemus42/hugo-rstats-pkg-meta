title: Partial Function Application with %<%, %-<%, and %><%
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  Partial application is the process of reducing the arity of a
  function by fixing one or more arguments, thus creating a new function
  lacking the fixed arguments. The curry package provides three different ways
  of performing partial function application by fixing arguments from either
  end of the argument list (currying and tail currying) or by fixing multiple
  named arguments (partial application). This package provides this
  functionality through the %<%, %-<%, and %><% operators which allows for
  a programming style comparable to modern functional languages. Compared
  to other implementations such a purrr::partial() the operators in curry
  composes functions with named arguments, aiding in autocomplete etc.
