title: Identifiability of Linear Structural Equation Models
maintainer: Luca Weihs
description: |-
  Provides routines to check identifiability or non-identifiability
  of linear structural equation models as described in Drton, Foygel, and
  Sullivant (2011) <DOI:10.1214/10-AOS859>, Foygel, Draisma, and Drton (2012)
  <DOI:10.1214/12-AOS1012>, and other works. The routines are based on the graphical
  representation of structural equation models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
