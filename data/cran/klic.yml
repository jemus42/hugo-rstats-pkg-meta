title: Kernel Learning Integrative Clustering
maintainer: Alessandra Cabassi
description: 'Kernel Learning Integrative Clustering (KLIC) is an algorithm that allows
  to combine multiple kernels, each representing a different measure of the similarity
  between a set of observations. The contribution of each kernel on the final clustering
  is weighted according to the amount of information carried by it. As well as providing
  the functions required to perform the kernel-based clustering, this package also
  allows the user to simply give the data as input: the kernels are then built using
  consensus clustering. Different strategies to choose the best number of clusters
  are also available. For further details please see Cabassi and Kirk (2019) <arXiv:1904.07701>.'
