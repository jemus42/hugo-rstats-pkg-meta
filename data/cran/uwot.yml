  The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) Method
  for Dimensionality Reduction
maintainer: James Melville
description: |-
  An implementation of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and
  Projection dimensionality reduction by McInnes et al. (2018)
  <arXiv:1802.03426>. It also provides means to transform new data and to
  carry out supervised dimensionality reduction. An implementation of the
  related LargeVis method of Tang et al. (2016) <arXiv:1602.00370> is also
  provided. This is a complete re-implementation in R (and C++, via the 'Rcpp'
  package): no Python installation is required. See the uwot website
  (<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot>) for more documentation and examples.
