title: Soft Windowing on Linear Regression
maintainer: Hamed Haselimashhadi
description: The main function in the package utilizes a windowing function in the
  form of an exponential weighting function to linear models. The bandwidth and sharpness
  of the window are controlled by two parameters. Then, a series of tests are used
  to identify the right parameters of the window (see Hamed Haselimashhadi et al (2019)
