title: '''Opal'' Data Repository Client and ''DataSHIELD'' Utils'
maintainer: Yannick Marcon
description: |-
  Data integration Web application for biobanks by 'OBiBa'. 'Opal' is
  the core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once
  collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
  data repository under a uniform model. 'Opal' is such a central repository.
  It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data.
  'Opal' is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
  assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless
  data-sharing among biobanks. This 'Opal' client allows to interact with 'Opal'
  web services and to perform operations on the R server side. 'DataSHIELD'
  administration tools are also provided.
