title: A 'Neo4J' Driver
maintainer: Colin Fay
description: |-
  A Modern and Flexible 'Neo4J' Driver, allowing you to query
  data on a 'Neo4J' server and handle the results in R. It's modern in
  the sense it provides a driver
  that can be easily integrated in a data analysis workflow, especially by
  providing an API working smoothly with other data analysis and graph
  packages. It's flexible in the  way it returns the results, by
  trying to stay as close as
  possible to the way 'Neo4J' returns data. That way, you have the control
  over the way you will compute the results. At the same time, the result
  is not too complex, so that the "heavy lifting" of data wrangling is not
  left to the user.
