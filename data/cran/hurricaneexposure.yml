  Explore and Map County-Level Hurricane Exposure in the United
  States
maintainer: Brooke Anderson
description: |-
  Allows users to create time series of tropical storm
  exposure histories for chosen counties for a number of hazard metrics
  (wind, rain, distance from the storm, etc.). This package interacts
  with data available through the 'hurricaneexposuredata' package, which
  is available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package, see the
  instructions at <https://github.com/geanders/hurricaneexposure>.
  The size of the 'hurricaneexposuredata' package is
  approximately 20 MB. This work was supported in part by grants from the National
  Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the National Science
  Foundation (1331399), and a NASA Applied Sciences Program/Public Health Program
  Grant (NNX09AV81G).
