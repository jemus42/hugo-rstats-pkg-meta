title: Multidimensional Item Response Theory
maintainer: Phil Chalmers
description: |-
  Analysis of dichotomous and polytomous response data using
  unidimensional and multidimensional latent trait models under the Item
  Response Theory paradigm (Chalmers (2012) <doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i06>).
  Exploratory and confirmatory models can be estimated with quadrature (EM)
  or stochastic (MHRM) methods. Confirmatory
  bi-factor and two-tier analyses are available for modeling item testlets.
  Multiple group analysis and mixed effects designs also are available for
  detecting differential item and test functioning as well as modeling
  item and person covariates. Finally, latent class models such as the DINA,
  DINO, multidimensional latent class, and several other discrete latent
  variable models, including mixture and zero-inflated response models,
  are supported.
