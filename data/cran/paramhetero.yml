  Numeric and Visual Comparisons of Heterogeneity in Parametric
  Models
maintainer: Travis Loux
description: |-
  Performs statistical tests to compare coefficients and residual
  variance across multiple models. Also provides graphical methods for
  assessing heterogeneity in coefficients and residuals. Currently supports
  linear and generalized linear models, as well as their multi-level and
  complex survey-weighted variations from the 'lme4' and 'survey' packages,
  respectively. Reference: Li (2015) <https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/3985/>.
