title: Representation of Archaeological Data
maintainer: Nicolas Frerebeau
description: |-
  A collection of classes that represent
  archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that
  extend the basic matrix data type (absolute/relative frequency,
  presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package
  developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic
  methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g.
  predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that
  represent stratigraphic relationships) are implemented.
