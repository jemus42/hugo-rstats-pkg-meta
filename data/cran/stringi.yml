version: 1.4.6
title: Character String Processing Facilities
maintainer: Marek Gagolewski
description: |-
  Fast, correct, consistent, portable and convenient character
  string/text processing in every locale and any native encoding.
  Owing to the use of the 'ICU' (International Components for Unicode)
  library, the package provides 'R' users with platform-independent functions
  known to 'Java', 'Perl', 'Python', 'PHP' and 'Ruby' programmers. Available
  features include: pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular
  expressions or the 'Unicode' collation algorithm), random string generation,
  case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation,
  Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing and many more.
