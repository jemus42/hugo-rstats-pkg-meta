  Multivariate Generalized Kernel Smoothing and Related
  Statistical Methods
maintainer: Abby Spurdle
description: Constructs, plots and evaluates probability distributions (probability
  mass/density functions, cumulative distribution functions and quantile functions)
  with continuous kernel smoothing, and to a lesser extent, discrete kernel smoothing.
  Supports univariate, multivariate and conditional distributions, including multivariate-conditional
  distributions. Also, supports other probability distributions (categorical, frequency
  and empirical-like) and weighted data, which is possibly useful mixed with fuzzy
  clustering. Furthermore, there are extensions for computing multivariate probabilities
  and multivariate random numbers, and for parameter and mode estimation.
