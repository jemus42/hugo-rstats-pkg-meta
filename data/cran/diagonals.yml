title: Block Diagonal Extraction or Replacement
maintainer: Bastiaan Quast
description: |-
  Several tools for handling block-matrix diagonals and similar
  constructs are implemented. Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed
  using two small functions implemented here. In addition, non-square matrices
  are supported. Block diagonal matrices occur when two dimensions of a data set
  are combined along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the
  'decompr' and 'gvc' packages have each country-industry combination occur along
  both edges of the matrix.
