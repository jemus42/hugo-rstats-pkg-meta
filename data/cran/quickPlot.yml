maintainer: Eliot J B McIntire
description: |-
  A high-level plotting system, built using 'grid' graphics, that is
  optimized for speed and modularity. This has great utility for quick
  visualizations when testing code, with the key benefit that visualizations
  are updated independently of one another.
