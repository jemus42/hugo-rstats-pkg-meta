  Generic N-Dimensional Hyperplane Fitting with Heteroscedastic
  Covariant Errors and Intrinsic Scatter
maintainer: Aaron Robotham
description: Includes two main high level codes for hyperplane fitting (hyper.fit)
  and visualising (hyper.plot2d / hyper.plot3d). In simple terms this allows the user
  to produce robust 1D linear fits for 2D x vs y type data, and robust 2D plane fits
  to 3D x vs y vs z type data. This hyperplane fitting works generically for any N-1
  hyperplane model being fit to a N dimension dataset. All fits include intrinsic
  scatter in the generative model orthogonal to the hyperplane.
