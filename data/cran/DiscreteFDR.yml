title: Multiple Testing Procedures with Adaptation for Discrete Tests
maintainer: Florian Junge
description: Multiple testing procedures described in the paper DÃ¶hler, Durand and
  Roquain (2018) "New FDR bounds for discrete and heterogeneous tests" <doi:10.1214/18-EJS1441>.
  The main procedures of the paper (HSU and HSD), their adaptive counterparts (AHSU
  and AHSD), and the HBR variant are available and are coded to take as input a set
  of observed p-values and their discrete support under the null. A function to compute
  such p-values and supports for Fisher's exact tests is also provided, along with
  a wrapper allowing to apply discrete procedures directly from contingency tables.
