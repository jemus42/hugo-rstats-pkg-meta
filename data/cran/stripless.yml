title: Structured Trellis Displays Without Strips for Lattice Graphics
maintainer: Bert Gunter
description: |-
  For making Trellis-type conditioning plots without strip labels.
  This is useful for displaying the structure of results from factorial designs
  and other studies when many conditioning variables would clutter the display
  with layers of redundant strip labels. Settings of the variables are encoded by
  layout and spacing in the trellis array and decoded by a separate legend. The
  functionality is implemented by a single S3 generic strucplot() function that
  is a wrapper for the Lattice package's xyplot() function. This allows access to
  all Lattice graphics capabilities in the usual way.
