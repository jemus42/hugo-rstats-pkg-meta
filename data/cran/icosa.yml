  Global Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated
  Icosahedra
maintainer: Adam T. Kocsis
description: |-
  Employs triangular tessellation to refine icosahedra
  defined in 3d space. The procedures can be set to provide a grid with a
  custom resolution. Both the primary triangular and their inverted penta-
  hexagonal grids are available for implementation. Additional functions
  are provided to position points (latitude-longitude data) on the grids,
  to allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.
