  Various reliability analysis methods for rare event inference:
  1) computing failure probability (probability that the output of a numerical model exceeds a threshold),
  2) computing quantiles of low or high-order,
  3) Wilks formula to compute quantile(s) from a sample or the size of the required i.i.d. sample.
