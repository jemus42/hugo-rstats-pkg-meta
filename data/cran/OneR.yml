  Enhancements
maintainer: Holger von Jouanne-Diedrich
description: Implements the One Rule (OneR) Machine Learning classification algorithm
  (Holte, R.C. (1993) <doi:10.1023/A:1022631118932>) with enhancements for sophisticated
  handling of numeric data and missing values together with extensive diagnostic functions.
  It is useful as a baseline for machine learning models and the rules are often helpful
  heuristics.
