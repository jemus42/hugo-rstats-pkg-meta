  Multivariate Normal Mixture Models and Mixtures of Generalized
  Linear Mixed Models Including Model Based Clustering
maintainer: Arnošt Komárek
description: Contains a mixture of statistical methods including the MCMC methods
  to analyze normal mixtures. Additionally, model based clustering methods are implemented
  to perform classification based on (multivariate) longitudinal (or otherwise correlated)
  data. The basis for such clustering is a mixture of multivariate generalized linear
  mixed models.
