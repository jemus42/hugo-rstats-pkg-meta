title: Calculates Probability of Superiority
maintainer: John Ruscio
description: |-
  The A() function calculates the A statistic, a nonparametric
  measure of effect size for two independent groups that’s also known as
  the probability of superiority (Ruscio, 2008), along with its standard
  error and a confidence interval constructed using bootstrap methods
  (Ruscio & Mullen, 2012). Optional arguments can be specified to
  calculate variants of the A statistic developed for other research
  designs (e.g., related samples, more than two independent groups or
  related samples; Ruscio & Gera, 2013).
