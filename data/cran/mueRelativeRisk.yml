title: Relative Risk Based on the Ratio of Median Unbiased Estimates
maintainer: Rickey Carter
description: Implements an estimator for relative risk based on the median unbiased
  estimator. The relative risk estimator is well defined and performs satisfactorily
  for a wide range of data configurations. The details of the method are available
  in Carter et al (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00711.x>.
