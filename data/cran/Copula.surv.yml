maintainer: Takeshi Emura
description: |-
  Perform association analysis of bivariate survival data based on copula models.
  Two different ways to estimate the association parameter in copula models are implemented.
  A goodness-of-fit test for a given copula model is implemented.
  See Emura, Lin and Wang (2010) <doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2010.03.013> for details.
