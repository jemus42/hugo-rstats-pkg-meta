title: A Bayesian Repulsive Biclustering Model for Periodontal Data
maintainer: Yuliang Li
description: |-
  BAREB, a BAyesian REpulsive Biclustering model,
  that can simultaneously cluster the Periodontal diseases (PD) patients
  and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site-level covariates into consideration.
  BAREB uses the determinantal point process (DPP) prior to induce diversity
  among different biclusters to facilitate parsimony and interpretability.
  Essentially, BAREB is a cluster-wise linear model based on Yuliang (2019) <arXiv:1902.05680>.
