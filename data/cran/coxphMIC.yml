  Sparse Estimation of Cox Proportional Hazards Models via
  Approximated Information Criterion
maintainer: Xiaogang Su
description: |-
  Sparse estimation for Cox PH models is done via
  Minimum approximated Information Criterion (MIC) by Su, Wijayasinghe,
  Fan, and Zhang (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12484>. MIC mimics the best
  subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet with no need
  of a tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with a
  re-parameterization step so that it reduces to one unconstrained non-convex
  yet smooth programming problem, which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore,
  the re-parameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of
  circumventing post-selection inference.
