title: Quantize Floating-Point Numbers for Improved Compressibility
maintainer: Daniel Baston
description: |-
  Provides a implementation of floating-point quantization algorithms for use in precision-preserving
  compression, similar to the approach taken in the 'netCDF operators' (NCO) software package and
  described in Zender (2016) <doi:10.5194/gmd-2016-63>.
