version: 0.1.2
title: Echogram Visualisation and Analysis
maintainer: HÃ©ctor Villalobos
description: Easily import multi-frequency acoustic data stored in 'HAC' files (see
  <http://biblio.uqar.ca/archives/30005500.pdf> for more information on the format),
  and produce echogram visualisations with predefined or customized color palettes.
  It is also possible to merge consecutive echograms; mask or delete unwanted echogram
  areas; model and subtract background noise; and more important, develop, test and
  interpret different combinations of frequencies in order to perform acoustic filtering
  of the echogram's data.
