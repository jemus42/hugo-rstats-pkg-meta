version: 1.0.1
title: Row and Position Tracheid Organizer
maintainer: Richard L. Peters
description: |-
  Performs wood cell anatomical data analyses on spatially explicit xylem (tracheids) datasets
  derived from thin sections of woody tissue. The package includes functions for visualisation,
  detection and alignment of continuous tracheid radial file (defined as rows) and individual tracheid position
  within an annual ring of coniferous species. This package is designed to be used with elaborate cell output,
  e.g. as provided with ROXAS (von Arx & Carrer, 2014 <doi:10.1016/j.dendro.2013.12.001>). The package has been validated for Picea abies,
  Larix Siberica, Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris.
