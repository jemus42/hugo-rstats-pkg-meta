  of Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE), Fenichel et al. (2016) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1513779113>
  in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Yun et al. (2017)
  in PNAS (accepted), and their extensions: creating Chebyshev polynomial nodes and
  grids, calculating basis of Chebyshev polynomials, approximation and their simulations
  for: V-approximation (single and multiple stocks, PNAS), P-approximation (single
  stock, PNAS), and Pdot-approximation (single stock, JAERE). Development of this
  package was generously supported by the Knobloch Family Foundation.'
