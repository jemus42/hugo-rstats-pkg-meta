title: Multiple Maps t-SNE
maintainer: Benjamin J. Radford
description: |-
  An implementation of multiple maps t-distributed stochastic
  neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Multiple maps t-SNE is a method for
  projecting high-dimensional data into several low-dimensional maps such that
  non-metric space properties are better preserved than they would be by a single
  map. Multiple maps t-SNE with only one map is equivalent to standard t-SNE.
  When projecting onto more than one map, multiple maps t-SNE estimates a set
  of latent weights that allow each point to contribute to one or more maps
  depending on similarity relationships in the original data. This
  implementation is a port of the original 'Matlab' library by Laurens van der
  Maaten.
