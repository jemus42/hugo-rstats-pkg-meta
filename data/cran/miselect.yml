title: Variable Selection for Multiply Imputed Data
maintainer: Alexander Rix
description: |2-

  Penalized regression methods, such as lasso and elastic net, are used in
  many biomedical applications when simultaneous regression coefficient
  estimation and variable selection is desired. However, missing data
  complicates the implementation of these methods, particularly when
  missingness is handled using multiple imputation. Applying a variable
  selection algorithm on each imputed dataset will likely lead
  to different sets of selected predictors, making it difficult
  to ascertain a final active set without resorting to ad hoc
  combination rules. 'miselect' presents Stacked Adaptive Elastic Net (saenet)
  and Grouped Adaptive LASSO (galasso) for continuous and binary outcomes,
  developed by Du et al (2020), currently under review. They, by construction,
  force selection of the same variables across multiply imputed data.
  'miselect' also provides cross validated variants of these methods.
