  - Table with the distribution of cases by Member State over the last five years;
  - Seasonality plot with the distribution of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area level,
  by month, over the past five years;
  - Trend plot with the trend and number of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area level,
  by month, over the past five years;
  - Age and gender bar graph with the distribution of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area level.
  Two types of datasets can be used:
  - The default dataset of salmonella 2012-2016 data;
  - Any dataset specified as described in the vignette.
