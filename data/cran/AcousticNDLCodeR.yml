title: Coding Sound Files for Use with NDL
maintainer: Denis Arnold
description: |-
  Make acoustic cues to use with the R packages 'ndl' or 'ndl2'. The package implements functions used
  in the PLoS ONE paper:
  Denis Arnold, Fabian Tomaschek, Konstantin Sering, Florence Lopez, and R. Harald Baayen (2017).
  Words from spontaneous conversational speech can be recognized with human-like accuracy by
  an error-driven learning algorithm that discriminates between meanings straight from smart
  acoustic features, bypassing the phoneme as recognition unit.  PLoS ONE 12(4):e0174623
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0174623>
  More details can be found in the paper and the supplement.
  'ndl' is available on CRAN. 'ndl2' is available by request from <konstantin.sering@uni-tuebingen.de>.
