maintainer: Conor Crowley
description: |-
  Imports 'StatBank' data in JSON-stat format and (optionally) reshapes it into wide
  format. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is the national statistical institute of Ireland
  and 'StatBank' is the CSOs online database of Official Statistics. This database contains current
  and historical data series compiled from CSO statistical releases and is accessed at
  <http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/statire/SelectTable/Omrade0.asp?Planguage=0>.
  A tutorial explaining and illustrating how to navigate to the 'StatBank' and how to search the
  'StatBank' by keyword or theme can be found here:
  <https://www.cso.ie/en/interactivezone/youtubevideos/statbanktutorial/>. This tutorial also
  demonstrates how a user can create, edit and download a table from the 'StatBank'. The CSO
  'StatBank' Application Programming Interface (API), which is accessed in this package, provides
  access to 'StatBank' data in JSON-stat format at <https://statbank.cso.ie/webserviceclient/>.
  This dissemination tool allows developers machine to machine access to CSO 'StatBank' data.
