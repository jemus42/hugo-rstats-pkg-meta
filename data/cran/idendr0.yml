maintainer: Tomas Sieger
description: |-
  Interactive dendrogram that enables the user to select and
  color clusters, to zoom and pan the dendrogram, and to visualize
  the clustered data not only in a built-in heat map, but also in
  'GGobi' interactive plots and user-supplied plots.
  This is a backport of Qt-based 'idendro'
  (<https://github.com/tsieger/idendro>) to base R graphics and
  Tcl/Tk GUI.
