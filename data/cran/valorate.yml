maintainer: Victor Trevino
description: |-
  The algorithm implemented in this package was
  designed to quickly estimates the distribution of the
  log-rank especially for heavy unbalanced groups. VALORATE
  estimates the null distribution and the p-value of the
  log-rank test based on a recent formulation. For a given
  number of alterations that define the size of survival
  groups, the estimation involves a weighted sum of
  distributions that are conditional on a co-occurrence term
  where mutations and events are both present. The estimation
  of conditional distributions is quite fast allowing the
  analysis of large datasets in few minutes
