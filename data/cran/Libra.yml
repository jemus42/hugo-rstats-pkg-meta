title: Linearized Bregman Algorithms for Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Jiechao Xiong
description: |-
  Efficient procedures for fitting the regularization path
  for linear, binomial, multinomial, Ising and Potts models with lasso,
  group lasso or column lasso(only for multinomial) penalty.
  The package uses Linearized Bregman Algorithm to solve the
  regularization path through iterations. Bregman Inverse Scale Space Differential
  Inclusion solver is also provided for linear model with lasso penalty.
