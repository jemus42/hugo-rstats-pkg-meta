version: '1.4'
title: Fast and URL-Safe Base64 Encoder and Decoder
maintainer: Michel Lang
description: |-
  In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with
  "-", the 63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder
  does not fill the string with trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings
  comply to the regular expression pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are
  safe to use in URLs or for file names.
  The package also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for
  case insensitive file systems.
