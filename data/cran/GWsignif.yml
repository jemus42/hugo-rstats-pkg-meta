  Estimating Genome-Wide Significance for Whole Genome Sequencing
  Studies, Either Single SNP Tests or Region-Based Tests
maintainer: ChangJiang Xu
description: The correlations and linkage disequilibrium between tests can vary as
  a function of minor allele frequency thresholds used to filter variants, and also
  varies with different choices of test statistic for region-based tests. Appropriate
  genome-wide significance thresholds can be estimated empirically through permutation
  on only a small proportion of the whole genome.
