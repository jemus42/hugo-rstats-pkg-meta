title: Hidden Markov Model for Continuous Observations Processes
maintainer: Mikhail A. Beketov
description: The package includes the functions designed to analyse continuous observations
  processes with the Hidden Markov Model approach. They include Baum-Welch and Viterbi
  algorithms and additional visualisation functions. The observations are assumed
  to have Gaussian distribution and to be weakly stationary processes. The package
  was created for analyses of financial time series, but can also be applied to any
  continuous observations processes.
