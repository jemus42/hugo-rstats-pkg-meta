title: Response Surface Analysis
maintainer: Felix Sch√∂nbrodt
description: |-
  Advanced response surface analysis. The main function RSA computes
  and compares several nested polynomial regression models (full second- or
  third-order polynomial, shifted and rotated squared difference model,
  rising ridge surfaces, basic squared difference model, asymmetric or
  level-dependent congruence effect models). The package provides plotting
  functions for 3d wireframe surfaces, interactive 3d plots, and contour plots.
  Calculates many surface parameters (a1 to a5, principal axes, stationary point,
  eigenvalues) and provides standard, robust, or bootstrapped standard errors
  and confidence intervals for them.
