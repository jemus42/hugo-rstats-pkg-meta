title: Reproduce Statistical Analyses and Meta-Analyses
maintainer: Lech Madeyski
description: Includes data analysis functions (e.g., to calculate effect sizes and
  95% Confidence Intervals (CI) on Standardised Effect Sizes (d) for AB/BA cross-over
  repeated-measures experimental designs), data presentation functions (e.g., density
  curve overlaid on histogram), and the data sets analyzed in different research papers
  in software engineering (e.g., related to software defect prediction or multi-site
  experiment concerning the extent to which structured abstracts were clearer and
  more complete than conventional abstracts) to streamline reproducible research in
  software engineering.
