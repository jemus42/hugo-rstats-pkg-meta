  Methods for Closed Testing with Simes Inequality, in Particular
  Hommel's Method
maintainer: Jelle Goeman
description: Provides methods for closed testing using Simes local tests. In particular,
  calculates adjusted p-values for Hommel's multiple testing method, and provides
  lower confidence bounds for true discovery proportions. A robust but more conservative
  variant of the closed testing procedure that does not require the assumption of
  Simes inequality is also implemented. The methods have been described in detail
  in Goeman et al (2016) <arXiv:1611.06739v2>.
