title: Fast and Robust Surrogate Variable Analysis
maintainer: Jun Chen
description: Introduces a fast and efficient Surrogate Variable Analysis algorithm
  that captures variation of unknown sources (batch effects) for high-dimensional
  data sets. The algorithm is built on the 'irwsva.build' function of the 'sva' package
  and proposes a revision on it that achieves an order of magnitude faster running
  time while trading no accuracy loss in return.
