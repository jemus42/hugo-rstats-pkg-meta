title: 'Exact Multinomial Test: Goodness-of-Fit Test for Discrete<U+000a>Multivariate
  data'
maintainer: Uwe Menzel
description: The package provides functions to carry out a<U+000a>Goodness-of-fit
  test for discrete multivariate data. It is<U+000a>tested if a given observation
  is likely to have occurred under<U+000a>the assumption of an ab-initio model. A
  p-value can be<U+000a>calculated using different distance measures between observed<U+000a>and
  expected frequencies. A Monte Carlo method is provided to<U+000a>make the package
  capable of solving high-dimensional problems.
