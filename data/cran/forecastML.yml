title: Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning Methods
maintainer: Nickalus Redell
description: The purpose of 'forecastML' is to simplify the process of multi-step-ahead
  forecasting with standard machine learning algorithms. 'forecastML' supports lagged,
  dynamic, static, and grouping features for modeling single and grouped numeric or
  factor/sequence time series. In addition, simple wrapper functions are used to support
  model-building with most R packages. This approach to forecasting is inspired by
  Bergmeir, Hyndman, and Koo's (2018) paper "A note on the validity of cross-validation
  for evaluating autoregressive time series prediction" <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2017.11.003>.
