title: Calculate Power and Sample Size for Two Sample Mean Tests
maintainer: Jinpu Li
description: |-
  Power calculations are a critical component of any research study to determine the
  minimum sample size necessary to detect differences between multiple groups. Here we
  present an 'R' package, 'PASSED', that performs power and sample size calculations for
  the test of two-sample means or ratios with data following beta,
  gamma (Chang et al. (2011), <doi:10.1007/s00180-010-0209-1>), normal,
  Poisson (Gu et al. (2008), <doi:10.1002/bimj.200710403>), binomial, geometric, and
  negative binomial (Zhu and Lakkis (2014), <doi:10.1002/sim.5947>) distributions.
