  Functional Data Analysis for Density Functions by Transformation
  to a Hilbert Space
maintainer: Alexander Petersen
description: |-
  An implementation of the methodology described in
  Petersen and Mueller (2016) <doi:10.1214/15-AOS1363> for the functional
  data analysis of samples of density functions.  Densities are first
  transformed to their corresponding log quantile densities, followed by
  ordinary Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA).  Transformation
  modes of variation yield improved interpretation of the variability in the
  data as compared to FPCA on the densities themselves.  The standard
  fraction of variance explained (FVE) criterion commonly used for functional
  data is adapted to the transformation setting, also allowing for an
  alternative quantification of variability for density data through the
  Wasserstein metric of optimal transport.
