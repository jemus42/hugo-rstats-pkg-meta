title: Exploratory Chemometrics for Spectroscopy
maintainer: Bryan A. Hanson
description: |-
  A collection of functions for top-down exploratory data analysis
  of spectral data including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR),
  Raman, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other similar types of spectroscopy.
  Includes functions for plotting and inspecting spectra, peak alignment,
  hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal components analysis (PCA) and
  model-based clustering. Robust methods appropriate for this type of
  high-dimensional data are available. ChemoSpec is designed for structured
  experiments, such as metabolomics investigations, where the samples fall into
  treatment and control groups. Graphical output is formatted consistently for
  publication quality plots. ChemoSpec is intended to be very user friendly and
  to help you get usable results quickly. A vignette covering typical operations
  is available.
