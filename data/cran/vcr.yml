title: Record 'HTTP' Calls to Disk
maintainer: Scott Chamberlain
description: |-
  Record test suite 'HTTP' requests and replays them during
  future runs. A port of the Ruby gem of the same name
  (<https://github.com/vcr/vcr/>). Works by hooking into the 'webmockr'
  R package for matching 'HTTP' requests by various rules ('HTTP' method,
  'URL', query parameters, headers, body, etc.), and then caching
  real 'HTTP' responses on disk in 'cassettes'. Subsequent 'HTTP' requests
  matching any previous requests in the same 'cassette' use a cached
  'HTTP' response.
