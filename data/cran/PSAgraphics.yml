title: Propensity Score Analysis Graphics
maintainer: James E. Helmreich
description: 'A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics<U+000a>to
  aid in a Propensity Score Analysis (PSA).  Functions<U+000a>include: cat.psa and
  box.psa to test balance within strata of<U+000a>categorical and quantitative covariates,
  circ.psa for a<U+000a>representation of the estimated effect size by stratum,<U+000a>loess.psa
  that provides a graphic and loess based effect size<U+000a>estimate, and various
  balance functions that provide measures<U+000a>of the balance achieved via a PSA
  in a categorical covariate.'
