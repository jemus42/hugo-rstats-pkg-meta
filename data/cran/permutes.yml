title: Permutation Tests for Time Series Data
maintainer: Cesko C. Voeten
description: |-
  Helps you determine the analysis window to use when analyzing densely-sampled
  time-series data, such as EEG data, using permutation testing (Maris & Oostenveld 2007)
  <doi:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.024>. These permutation tests can help identify the timepoints
  where significance of an effect begins and ends, and the results can be plotted in various
  types of heatmap for reporting.
