maintainer: Bryan Stanfill
description: |-
  The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) is a widely
  used simulator of agricultural systems.  This package includes
  functions to create, edit and run APSIM simulations from R.  It
  also includes functions to visualize the results of an APSIM simulation
  and perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of APSIM either via functions
  in the sensitivity package or by novel emulator-based functions.
