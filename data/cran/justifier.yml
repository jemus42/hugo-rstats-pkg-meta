  Human and Machine-Readable Justifications and Justified
  Decisions Based on 'YAML'
maintainer: Gjalt-Jorn Ygram Peters
description: |-
  Leverages the 'yum' package to
  implement a 'YAML' ('YAML Ain't Markup Language', a human
  friendly standard for data serialization; see <https:yaml.org>)
  standard for documenting justifications, such as for decisions
  taken during the planning, execution and analysis of a study
  or during the development of a behavior change intervention
  as illustrated by Marques & Peters (2019)
  <doi:10.17605/osf.io/ndxha>. These justifications are both
  human- and machine-readable, facilitating efficient extraction
  and organisation.
