description: Statistical utilities for the analysis of data by means of the Marshall-Olkin
  Extended Zipf distribution are presented. The distribution is a two-parameter extension
  of the widely used Zipf model. By plotting the probabilities in log-log scale, this
  two-parameter extension allows a concave as well as a convex behavior of the function
  at the beginning of the distribution, maintaining the linearity, associated to the
  Zipf model, in the tail.
