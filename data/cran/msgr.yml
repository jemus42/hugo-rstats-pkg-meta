  Files
maintainer: Chad Goymer
description: |-
  Provides new functions info(), warn() and error(), similar to message(),
  warning() and stop() respectively. However, the new functions can have a 'level'
  associated with them, so that when executed the global level option determines whether
  they are shown or not. This allows debug modes, outputting more information. The can also
  output all messages to a log file.
