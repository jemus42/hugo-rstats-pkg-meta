title: Bayesian Inference for Factor Modeling
maintainer: RÃ©mi Piatek
description: |-
  Collection of procedures to perform Bayesian analysis on a variety
  of factor models. Currently, it includes: Bayesian Exploratory Factor
  Analysis (befa), an approach to dedicated factor analysis with stochastic
  search on the structure of the factor loading matrix. The number of latent
  factors, as well as the allocation of the manifest variables to the factors,
  are not fixed a priori but determined during MCMC sampling.
  More approaches will be included in future releases of this package.
