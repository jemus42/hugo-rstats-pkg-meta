title: Genetic Algorithm for Wind Farm Layout Optimization
maintainer: Sebastian Gatscha
description: The genetic algorithm is designed to optimize wind farms of any shape.
  It requires a predefined amount of turbines, a unified rotor radius and an average
  wind speed value for each incoming wind direction. A terrain effect model can be
  included that downloads an 'SRTM' elevation model and loads a Corine Land Cover
  raster to approximate surface roughness.
