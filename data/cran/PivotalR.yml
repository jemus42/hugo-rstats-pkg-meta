  A Fast, Easy-to-Use Tool for Manipulating Tables in Databases
  and a Wrapper of MADlib
maintainer: Rahul Iyer
description: |-
  Provides an R interface for the Pivotal Data stack
  running on 'PostgreSQL', 'Greenplum' or 'Apache HAWQ (incubating)'
  databases with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data
  processing. 'PivotalR' provides an R interface to various database
  operations on tables or views. These operations are almost the same as
  the corresponding native R operations. Thus users of R do not need
  to learn 'SQL' when they operate on objects in the database. It also
  provides a wrapper for 'Apache MADlib (incubating)', which is an open-
  source library for parallel and scalable in-database analytics.
