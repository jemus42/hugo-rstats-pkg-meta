title: '''Rcpp'' Interface to ''sparsepp'''
maintainer: Dmitriy Selivanov
description: |-
  Provides interface to 'sparsepp' - fast, memory efficient hash map.
  It is derived from Google's excellent 'sparsehash' implementation.
  We believe 'sparsepp' provides an unparalleled combination of performance and memory usage,
  and will outperform your compiler's unordered_map on both counts.
  Only Google's 'dense_hash_map' is consistently faster, at the cost of much greater
  memory usage (especially when the final size of the map is not known in advance).
