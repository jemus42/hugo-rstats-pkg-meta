title: Simulation of Legal Exemption System for European Cartel Law
maintainer: Martin Becker
description: |-
  Monte Carlo simulations of a game-theoretic model for the
  legal exemption system of the European cartel law are implemented
  in order to estimate the (mean) deterrent effect of this system.
  The input and output parameters of the simulated cartel
  opportunities can be visualized by three-dimensional projections.
