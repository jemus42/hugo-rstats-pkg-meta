title: Fast Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection
maintainer: Yifan (Ethan) Xu
description: |-
  An implementation of ADPclust clustering procedures (Fast
  Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection). The work is built and
  improved upon the idea of Rodriguez and Laio (2014)<DOI:10.1126/science.1242072>.
  ADPclust clusters data by finding density peaks in a density-distance plot
  generated from local multivariate Gaussian density estimation. It includes
  an automatic centroids selection and parameter optimization algorithm, which
  finds the number of clusters and cluster centroids by comparing average
  silhouettes on a grid of testing clustering results; It also includes a user
  interactive algorithm that allows the user to manually selects cluster
  centroids from a two dimensional "density-distance plot". Here is the
  research article associated with this package: "Wang, Xiao-Feng, and
  Yifan Xu (2015)<DOI:10.1177/0962280215609948> Fast clustering using adaptive
  density peak detection." Statistical methods in medical research". url:
