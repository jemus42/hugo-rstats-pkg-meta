title: Satellite Derived Water Quality Detection Algorithms
maintainer: Richard Johansen
description: |-
  The goal of 'waterquality' is to convert satellite-reflectance imagery
  to a host of pre-defined water quality algorithms designed for the detection of
  chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin), and turbidity.
  This package is able to process the following sensor configurations:
  WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, and MERIS.
