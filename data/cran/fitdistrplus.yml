  Help to Fit of a Parametric Distribution to Non-Censored or
  Censored Data
maintainer: Aurelie Siberchicot
description: Extends the fitdistr() function (of the MASS package) with several functions
  to help the fit of a parametric distribution to non-censored or censored data. Censored
  data may contain left censored, right censored and interval censored values, with
  several lower and upper bounds. In addition to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
  the package provides moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME) and maximum
  goodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) methods (available only for non-censored data).
  Weighted versions of MLE, MME and QME are available. See e.g. Casella & Berger (2002).
