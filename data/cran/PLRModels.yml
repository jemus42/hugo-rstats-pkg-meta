title: Statistical inference in partial linear regression models
maintainer: German Aneiros Perez
description: |-
  This package provides statistical inference tools applied to Partial Linear Regression (PLR)
  models. Specifically, point estimation, confidence intervals estimation, bandwidth selection, goodness-of-fit tests and analysis of
  covariance are considered.
  Kernel-based methods, combined with ordinary least squares estimation, are used and time series
  errors are allowed. In addition, these techniques are also implemented for both parametric (linear)
  and nonparametric regression models.
