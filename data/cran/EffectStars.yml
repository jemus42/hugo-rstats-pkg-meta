title: Visualization of Categorical Response Models
maintainer: Gunther Schauberger
description: 'Notice: The package EffectStars2 provides a more up-to-date implementation
  of effect stars! EffectStars provides functions to visualize regression models with
  categorical response as proposed by Tutz and Schauberger (2013) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.701379>.
  The effects of the variables are plotted with star plots in order to allow for an
  optical impression of the fitted model.'
