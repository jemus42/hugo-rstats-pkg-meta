maintainer: Marco Johannes Maier
description: Generates design matrix for analysing real paired comparisons and derived
  paired comparison data (Likert type items/ratings or rankings) using a loglinear
  approach. Fits loglinear Bradley-Terry model (LLBT) exploiting an eliminate feature.
  Computes pattern models for paired comparisons, rankings, and ratings. Some treatment
  of missing values (MCAR and MNAR). Fits latent class (mixture) models for paired
  comparison, rating and ranking patterns using a non-parametric ML approach.
