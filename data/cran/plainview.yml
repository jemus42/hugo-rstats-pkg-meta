title: Plot Raster Images Interactively on a Plain HTML Canvas
maintainer: Tim Appelhans
description: |-
  Provides methods for plotting potentially large (raster) images
  interactively on a plain HTML canvas. In contrast to package 'mapview'
  data are plotted without background map, but data can be projected to
  any spatial coordinate reference system.
  Supports plotting of classes 'RasterLayer', 'RasterStack', 'RasterBrick'
  (from package 'raster') as well as 'png' files located on disk.
  Interactivity includes zooming, panning, and mouse location information.
  In case of multi-layer 'RasterStacks' or 'RasterBricks', RGB image plots
  are created (similar to 'raster::plotRGB' - but interactive).
