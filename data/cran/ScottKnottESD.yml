title: The Scott-Knott Effect Size Difference (ESD) Test
maintainer: Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn
description: The Scott-Knott Effect Size Difference (ESD) test is a mean comparison
  approach that leverages a hierarchical clustering to partition the set of treatment
  means (e.g., means of variable importance scores, means of model performance) into
  statistically distinct groups with non-negligible difference [Tantithamthavorn et
  al., (2018) <doi:10.1109/TSE.2018.2794977>].
