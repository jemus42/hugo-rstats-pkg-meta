title: '''DataSHIELD'' Implementation for ''Opal'''
maintainer: Yannick Marcon
description: |-
  'DataSHIELD' is an infrastructure and series of R packages that
  enables the remote and 'non-disclosive' analysis of sensitive research data.
  This package is the 'DataSHIELD' interface implementation for 'Opal', which is
  the data integration application for biobanks by 'OBiBa'. Participant data, once
  collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
  data repository under a uniform model. 'Opal' is such a central repository.
  It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data.
  'Opal' is the reference implementation of the 'DataSHIELD' infrastructure.
