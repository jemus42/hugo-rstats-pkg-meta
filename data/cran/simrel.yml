title: Simulation of Multivariate Linear Model Data
maintainer: Raju Rimal
description: |-
  Simulate multivariate linear model data is useful in research and education weather
  for comparison or create data with specific properties. This package lets user to simulate
  linear model data of wide range of properties with few tuning parameters.
  The package also consist of function to create plots for the simulation
  objects and A shiny app as RStudio gadget. It can be a handy tool for model comparison,
  testing and many other purposes.
