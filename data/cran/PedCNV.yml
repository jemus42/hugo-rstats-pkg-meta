title: An implementation for association analysis with CNV data.
maintainer: Meiling Liu
description: |-
  An implementation for association analysis with CNV data in R. It
  provides two methods for association study: first, the observed probe
  intensity measurement can be directly used to detect the association of CNV
  with phenotypes of interest. Second, the most probable copy number is
  estimated with the proposed likelihood and the association of the most
  probable copy number with phenotype is tested. This method can be applied
  to both the independent and correlated population.
