title: Optimal Discriminating Designs
maintainer: Roman Guchenko
description: A collection of functions for numerical construction of optimal discriminating
  designs. At the current moment T-optimal designs (which maximize the lower bound
  for the power of F-test for regression model discrimination), KL-optimal designs
  (for lognormal errors) and their robust analogues can be calculated with the package.
