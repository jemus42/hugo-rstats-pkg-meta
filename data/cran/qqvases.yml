title: Animated Normal Quantile-Quantile Plots
maintainer: Robert Stine
description: Presents an explanatory animation of normal quantile-quantile plots based
  on a water-filling analogy.  The animation presents a normal QQ plot as the parametric
  plot of the water levels in vases defined by two distributions.  The distributions
  decorate the axes in the normal QQ plot and are optionally shown as vases adjacent
  to the plot.  The package draws QQ plots for several distributions, either as samples
  or continuous functions.
