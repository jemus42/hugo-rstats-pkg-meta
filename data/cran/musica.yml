maintainer: Martin Hanel
description: Provides functions allowing for (1) easy aggregation of multivariate
  time series into custom time scales, (2) comparison of statistical summaries between
  different data sets at multiple time scales (e.g. observed and bias-corrected data),
  (3) comparison of relations between variables and/or different data sets at multiple
  time scales (e.g. correlation of precipitation and temperature in control and scenario
  simulation) and (4) transformation of time series at custom time scales.
