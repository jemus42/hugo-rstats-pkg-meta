maintainer: Charles Kooperberg
description: Analytical power calculations for GxE and GxG interactions for case-control
  studies of candidate genes and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This includes
  power calculation for four two-step screening and testing procedures.  It can also
  calculate power for GxE and GxG without any screening.
