title: Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) Reconciliation Method
maintainer: Jairo Cugliari
description: In hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting, the hierarchical relation
  between multiple time series is exploited to make better forecasts. This hierarchical
  relation implies one or more aggregate consistency constraints that the series are
  known to satisfy. Many existing approaches, like for example bottom-up or top-down
  forecasting, therefore attempt to achieve this goal in a way that guarantees that
  the forecasts will also be aggregate consistent. This package provides with an implementation
  of the Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) reconciliation method proposed in van Erven
  and Cugliari (2015), which is guaranteed to only improve any given set of forecasts.
  This opens up new possibilities  for constructing the forecasts. For example, it
  is not necessary to assume that bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate
  forecasts may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts and on
  other covariates that may only be available at the aggregate level.
