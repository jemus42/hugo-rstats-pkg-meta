title: Mixture fMRI Clustering Analysis
maintainer: Wei-Chen Chen
description: |-
  Utilizing model-based clustering (unsupervised)
  for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
  The developed methods (Chen and Maitra (2018, manuscript)) include
  2D and 3D clustering analyses (for p-values with voxel locations) and
  segmentation analyses (for p-values alone) for fMRI data where p-values
  indicate significant level of activation responding to stimulate
  of interesting. The analyses are mainly identifying active
  voxel/signal associated with normal brain behaviors.
  Analysis pipelines (R scripts) utilizing this package
  (see examples in 'inst/workflow/') is also implemented with high
  performance techniques.
