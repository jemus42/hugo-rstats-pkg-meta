  Markov Regime Switching Copula Models Estimation and Goodness of
  Fit
maintainer: Mamadou Yamar Thioub
description: |-
  R functions to estimate and perform goodness of fit test for several
  Markov regime switching and mixture bivariate copula models.
  The goodness of fit test is based on a Cramer von Mises statistic and
  uses the Rosenblatt transform and parametric bootstrap to estimate the p-value.
  The estimation of the copula parameters are based on the pseudo-maximum likelihood
  method using pseudo-observations defined as normalized ranks.
