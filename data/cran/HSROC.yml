  Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy when Reference Test is
  Imperfect
maintainer: Ian Schiller
description: Implements a model for joint meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity
  of the diagnostic test under evaluation, while taking into account the possibly
  imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the reference test. This hierarchical model
  accounts for both within and between study variability. Estimation is carried out
  using a Bayesian approach, implemented via a Gibbs sampler. The model can be applied
  in situations where more than one reference test is used in the selected studies.
