title: Find and Fill Gaps in Metabolic Networks
maintainer: Daniel Osorio
description: For a given metabolic network, this package finds the gaps (metabolites
  not produced or not consumed in any other reaction), and fills it from the stoichiometric
  reactions of a reference metabolic reconstruction using a weighting function. Also
  the option to download all the set of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for
  a specific organism from the KEGG database <http://www.genome.jp/kegg/> is available.
