description: SCEPtER pipeline for estimating the stellar age, mass, and radius<U+000a>given
  observational<U+000a>effective temperature, [Fe/H], and astroseismic<U+000a>parameters.
  The results are obtained adopting a maximum likelihood<U+000a>technique over a grid
  of pre-computed stellar models.
