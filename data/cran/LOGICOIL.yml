  LOGICOIL: multi-state prediction of coiled-coil oligomeric
  state.
maintainer: Thomas L. Vincent
description: This package contains the functions necessary to run the LOGICOIL algorithm.
  LOGICOIL can be used to differentiate between antiparallel dimers, parallel dimers,
  trimers and higher-order coiled-coil sequence. By covering >90 percent of the known
  coiled-coil structures, LOGICOIL is a net improvement compared with other existing
  methods, which achieve a predictive coverage of around 31 percent of this population.
  As such, LOGICOIL is particularly useful for researchers looking to characterize
  novel coiled-coil sequences or studying coiled-coil containing protein assemblies.
  It may also be used to assist in the structural characterization of synthetic coiled-coil
  sequences.
