version: 0.9.3
title: Docker Client
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Work with containers over the Docker API.  Rather than
  using system calls to interact with a docker client, using the
  API directly means that we can receive richer information from
  docker.  The interface in the package is automatically generated
  using the 'OpenAPI' (a.k.a., 'swagger') specification, and all
  return values are checked in order to make them type stable.
