version: 1.0.1
title: Modified Rand and Wallace Indices
maintainer: Marjan Cugmas
description: It provides functions to compute the values of different modifications
  of the Rand and Wallace indices. The indices are used to measure the stability or
  similarity of two partitions obtained on two different sets of units with a non-empty
  intercept. Splitting and merging of clusters can (depends on the selected index)
  have a different effect on the value of the indices.  The indices are proposed in
  Cugmas and Ferligoj (2018) <http://ibmi.mf.uni-lj.si/mz/2018/no-1/Cugmas2018.pdf>.
