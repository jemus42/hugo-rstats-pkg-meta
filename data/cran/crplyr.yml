title: A 'dplyr' Interface for Crunch
maintainer: Greg Freedman Ellis
description: |-
  In order to facilitate analysis of datasets hosted on the Crunch
  data platform <http://crunch.io/>, the 'crplyr' package implements 'dplyr'
  methods on top of the Crunch backend. The usual methods 'select', 'filter',
  'group_by', 'summarize', and 'collect' are implemented in such a way as to
  perform as much computation on the server and pull as little data locally
  as possible.
