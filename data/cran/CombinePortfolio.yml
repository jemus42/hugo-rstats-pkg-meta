  Estimation of Optimal Portfolio Weights by Combining Simple
  Portfolio Strategies
maintainer: Florian Ziel
description: Estimation of optimal portfolio weights as combination of simple portfolio
  strategies, like the tangency, global minimum variance (GMV) or naive (1/N) portfolio.
  It is based on a utility maximizing 8-fund rule. Popular special cases like the
  Kan-Zhou(2007) 2-fund and 3-fund rule or the Tu-Zhou(2011) estimator are nested.
