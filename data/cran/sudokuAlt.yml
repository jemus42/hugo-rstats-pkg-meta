description: |-
  Tools for making, retrieving, displaying and solving sudoku games.
  This package is an alternative to the earlier sudoku-solver package,
  'sudoku'.  The present package uses a slightly different algorithm, has a
  simpler coding and presents a few more sugar tools, such as plot and print
  methods.  Solved sudoku games are of some interest in Experimental Design
  as examples of Latin Square designs with additional balance constraints.
