title: Fast k-Nearest Neighbors
maintainer: Gaston Besanson
description: Compute labels for a test set according to the k-Nearest Neighbors classification.
  This is a fast way to do k-Nearest Neighbors classification because the distance
  matrix -between the features of the observations- is an input to the function rather
  than being calculated in the function itself every time.
