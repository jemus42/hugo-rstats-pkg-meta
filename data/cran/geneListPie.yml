title: Profiling a gene list into GOslim or KEGG function pie
maintainer: Xutao Deng
description: |-
  "geneListPie" package is for mapping a gene list to
  function categories defined in GOSlim or Kegg. The results can
  be plotted as a pie chart to provide a quick view of the genes
  distribution of the gene list among the function categories.
  The gene list must contain a list of gene symbols. The package
  contains a set of pre-processed gene sets obtained from Gene
  Ontology and MSigDB including human, mouse, rat and yeast. To
  provide a high level concise view, only GO slim and kegg are
  provided. The gene sets are regulared updated. User can also
  use customized gene sets. User can use the R Pie() or Pie3D()
  function for plotting the pie chart. Users can also choose to
  output the gene function mapping results and use external
  software such as Excel(R) for ploting.
