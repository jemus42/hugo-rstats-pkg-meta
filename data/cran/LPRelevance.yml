title: Relevance-Integrated Statistical Inference Engine
maintainer: Kaijun Wang
description: |-
  A framework of methods to perform customized inference at individual level
  by taking contextual covariates into account. Three main functions are provided
  in this package: (i) LASER(): it generates specially-designed artificial relevant
  samples for a given case; (ii) g2l.proc(): computes customized fdr(z|x); and (iii)
  rEB.proc(): performs empirical Bayes inference based on LASERs. The details can be
  found in Mukhopadhyay, S., and Wang, K (2020, Technical Report).
