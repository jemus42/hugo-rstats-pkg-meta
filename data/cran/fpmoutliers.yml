title: Frequent Pattern Mining Outliers
maintainer: Jaroslav Kuchar
description: |-
  Algorithms for detection of outliers based on frequent pattern
  mining. Such algorithms follow the paradigm: if an instance contains more frequent patterns,
  it means that this data instance is unlikely to be an anomaly (He Zengyou, Xu Xiaofei, Huang
  Zhexue Joshua, Deng Shengchun (2005) <doi:10.2298/CSIS0501103H>).
  The package implements a list of existing state of the art algorithms as well as other published
  approaches: FPI, WFPI, FPOF, FPCOF, LFPOF, MFPOF, WCFPOF and WFPOF.
