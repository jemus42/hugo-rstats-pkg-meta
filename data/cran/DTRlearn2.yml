  Statistical Learning Methods for Optimizing Dynamic Treatment
  Regimes
maintainer: Yuan Chen
description: We provide a comprehensive software to estimate general K-stage DTRs
  from SMARTs with Q-learning and a variety of outcome-weighted learning methods.
  Penalizations are allowed for variable selection and model regularization. With
  the outcome-weighted learning scheme, different loss functions - SVM hinge loss,
  SVM ramp loss, binomial deviance loss, and L2 loss - are adopted to solve the weighted
  classification problem at each stage; augmentation in the outcomes is allowed to
  improve efficiency. The estimated DTR can be easily applied to a new sample for
  individualized treatment recommendations or DTR evaluation.
