description: |-
  It provides utility functions for investigating changes within R
  packages. The pkgInfo() function extracts package information such as
  exported and non-exported functions as well as their arguments. The
  pkgDiff() function compares this information for two versions of a package
  and creates a diff file viewable in a browser.
