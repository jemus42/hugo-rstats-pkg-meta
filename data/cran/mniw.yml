title: The Matrix-Normal Inverse-Wishart Distribution
maintainer: Martin Lysy
description: Density evaluation and random number generation for the Matrix-Normal
  Inverse-Wishart (MNIW) distribution, as well as the the Matrix-Normal, Matrix-T,
  Wishart, and Inverse-Wishart distributions.  Core calculations are implemented in
  a portable (header-only) C++ library, with matrix manipulations using the 'Eigen'
  library for linear algebra.  Also provided is a Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference
  on a random-effects model with multivariate normal observations.
