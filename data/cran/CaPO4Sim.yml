  A Virtual Patient Simulator in the Context of Calcium and
  Phosphate Homeostasis
maintainer: David Granjon
description: |-
  Explore calcium (Ca) and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis with two novel 'Shiny' apps,
  building upon on a previously published mathematical model written in C,
  to ensure efficient computations. The underlying model is accessible
  here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747359>.
  The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis,
  while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic,
  thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation.
  These applications are hosted at <https://rinterface.com/AppsPhysiol.html>.
