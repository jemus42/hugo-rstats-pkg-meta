  MCMC Simulation and Convergence Evaluation using Entropy and
  Kullback-Leibler Divergence Estimation
maintainer: Didier Chauveau
description: Tools for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and performance
  analysis. Simulate MCMC algorithms including adaptive MCMC, evaluate their convergence
  rate, and compare candidate MCMC algorithms for a same target density, based on
  entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence criteria. MCMC algorithms can be simulated
  using provided functions, or imported from external codes. This package is based
  upon work starting with Chauveau, D. and Vandekerkhove, P. (2013) <doi:10.1051/ps/2012004>
  and next articles.
