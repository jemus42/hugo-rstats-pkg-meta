title: Spatial Forecast Verification
maintainer: Eric Gilleland
description: Spatial forecast verification arose from verifying high-resolution forecasts,
  where coarser-resolution models generally are favored even when a human forecaster
  finds the higher-resolution model to be considerably better.  Most newly proposed
  methods, which largely come from image analysis, computer vision, and similar, are
  available, with more on the way.
