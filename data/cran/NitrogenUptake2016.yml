maintainer: Troy D. Hill
description: 'Contains data, code, and figures from Hill et al. 2018a (Journal of
  Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology; <DOI: 10.1016/j.jembe.2018.07.006>) and
  Hill et al. 2018b (Data In Brief <DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2018.09.133>). Datasets document
  plant allometry, stem heights, nutrient and stable isotope content, and sediment
  denitrification enzyme assays. The data and analysis offer an examination of nitrogen
  uptake and allocation in two salt marsh plant species.'
