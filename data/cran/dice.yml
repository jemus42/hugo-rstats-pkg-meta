title: Calculate probabilities of various dice-rolling events
maintainer: Dylan Arena
description: This package provides utilities to calculate the probabilities of various
  dice-rolling events, such as the probability of rolling a four-sided die six times
  and getting a 4, a 3, and either a 1 or 2 among the six rolls (in any order); the
  probability of rolling two six-sided dice three times and getting a 10 on the first
  roll, followed by a 4 on the second roll, followed by anything but a 7 on the third
  roll; or the probabilities of each possible sum of rolling five six-sided dice,
  dropping the lowest two rolls, and summing the remaining dice.
