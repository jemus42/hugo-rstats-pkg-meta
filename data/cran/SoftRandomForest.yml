title: Classification Random Forests for Soft Decision Trees
maintainer: Gregory Hilleren
description: |-
  Performs random forests for soft decision trees for a
  classification problem.  Current limitations are for a maximum depth of 5
  resulting in 16 terminal nodes.  Some data cleaning is required before
  input.  Final graphic output requires currently requires exporting to 'Microsoft
  Excel' for visualization.  Method based on Irsoy, Yildiz and Alpaydin (2012, ISBN: 978-4-9906441-1-6).
