title: Depth Tools Package
maintainer: Aurora Torrente
description: depthTools is a package that implements different<U+000a>statistical
  tools for the description and analysis of gene<U+000a>expression data based on the
  concept of data depth, namely, the<U+000a>scale curves for visualizing the dispersion
  of one or various<U+000a>groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to
  decide<U+000a>whether two groups of samples come from a single distribution<U+000a>and
  two methods of supervised classification techniques, the DS<U+000a>and TAD methods.
  All these techniques are based on the Modified<U+000a>Band Depth, which is a recent
  notion of depth with a low<U+000a>computational cost, what renders it very appropriate
  for high<U+000a>dimensional data such as gene expression data.
