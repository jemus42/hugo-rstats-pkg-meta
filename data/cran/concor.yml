description: The four functions svdcp (cp for column partitioned),<U+000a>svdbip or
  svdbip2 (bip for bi-partitioned), and svdbips (s for<U+000a>a simultaneous optimization
  of one set of r solutions),<U+000a>correspond to a "SVD by blocks" notion, by supposing
  each block<U+000a>depending on relative subspaces, rather than on two whole<U+000a>spaces
  as usual SVD does. The other functions, based on this<U+000a>notion, are relative
  to two column partitioned data matrices x<U+000a>and y defining two sets of subsets
  xi and yj of variables and<U+000a>amount to estimate a link between xi and yj for
  the pair (xi,<U+000a>yj) relatively to the links associated to all the other pairs.
