  Template Model Builder: A General Random Effect Tool Inspired by
  'ADMB'
maintainer: Kasper Kristensen
description: |-
  With this tool, a user should be able to quickly implement
  complex random effect models through simple C++ templates. The package combines
  'CppAD' (C++ automatic differentiation), 'Eigen' (templated matrix-vector
  library) and 'CHOLMOD' (sparse matrix routines available from R) to obtain
  an efficient implementation of the applied Laplace approximation with exact
  derivatives. Key features are: Automatic sparseness detection, parallelism
  through 'BLAS' and parallel user templates.
