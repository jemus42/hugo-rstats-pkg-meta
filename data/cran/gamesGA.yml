title: Genetic Algorithm for Sequential Symmetric Games
maintainer: A. Bradley Duthie
description: |-
  Finds adaptive strategies for sequential symmetric
  games using a genetic algorithm. Currently, any symmetric two by two matrix
  is allowed, and strategies can remember the history of an opponent's play
  from the previous three rounds of moves in iterated interactions between
  players. The genetic algorithm returns a list of adaptive strategies given
  payoffs, and the mean fitness of strategies in each generation.
