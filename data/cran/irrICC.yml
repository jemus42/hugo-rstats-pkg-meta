maintainer: Kilem L. Gwet
description: |-
  Calculates various intraclass correlation coefficients used to quantify
  inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.  The assumption here is that the raters produced quantitative ratings. Most of the statistical procedures implemented
  in this package are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2014, ISBN:978-0970806284): "Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability," 4th edition,
