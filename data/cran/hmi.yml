version: 0.9.18
title: Hierarchical Multiple Imputation
maintainer: Matthias Speidel
description: Runs single level and multilevel imputation models. The user just has
  to pass the data to the main function and, optionally, his analysis model. Basically
  the package then translates this analysis model into commands to impute the data
  according to it with functions from 'mice', 'MCMCglmm' or routines build for this
  package.
