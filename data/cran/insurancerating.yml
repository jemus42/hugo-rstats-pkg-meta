description: |-
  Methods for insurance rating. It helps actuaries to implement GLMs within all relevant steps needed to construct
  a risk premium from raw data. It provides a data driven strategy for the construction of insurance tariff classes.
  This strategy is based on the work by Antonio and Valdez (2012) <doi:10.1007/s10182-011-0152-7>. It also provides recipes
  on how to easily perform one-way, or univariate, analyses on an insurance portfolio. In addition it adds functionality
  to include reference categories in the levels of the coefficients in the output of a generalized linear regression analysis.
