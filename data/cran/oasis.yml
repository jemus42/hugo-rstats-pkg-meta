  Imaging (MRI)

description: |-
  Trains and makes predictions from the OASIS method, described in
  detail in the paper "OASIS is Automated Statistical Inference for Segmentation,
  with applications to multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation in MRI"
  <doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2013.03.002>.
  OASIS is a method for multiple sclerosis (MS)
  lesion segmentation on structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) studies. OASIS
  creates probability maps of lesion presence using the FLAIR, T2, T1, and PD
  structural MRI volumes. This packages allows for training of the OASIS model
  and prediction of OASIS probability maps from a trained model with user supplied
  studies that have a gold standard lesion segmentation masks. The package will
  also create OASIS probability maps for MRI studies using the OASIS model from
  the OASIS paper if no gold standard lesion segmentation masks are available.
