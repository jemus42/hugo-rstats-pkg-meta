title: Regression Models with Break-Points / Change-Points Estimation
maintainer: Vito M. R. Muggeo
description: Given a regression model, segmented `updates' it by adding one or more
  segmented (i.e., piece-wise linear) relationships. Several variables with multiple
  breakpoints are allowed. The estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003, <doi:10.1002/sim.1545>)
  and illustrated in Muggeo (2008, <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf>).
  An approach for hypothesis testing is presented in Muggeo (2016, <doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855>),
  and interval estimation for the breakpoint is discussed in Muggeo (2017, <doi:10.1111/anzs.12200>).
