title: An Interface to the Nexus Class Library
maintainer: Francois Michonneau
description: |-
  An interface to the Nexus Class Library which allows parsing
  of NEXUS, Newick and other phylogenetic tree file formats. It provides
  elements of the file that can be used to build phylogenetic objects
  such as ape's 'phylo' or phylobase's 'phylo4(d)'. This functionality
  is demonstrated with 'read_newick_phylo()' and 'read_nexus_phylo()'.
