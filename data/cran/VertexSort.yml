title: Network Hierarchical Structure and Randomization
maintainer: Diala Abd-Rabbo
description: 'Permits to apply the ''Vertex Sort'' algorithm (Jothi et al. (2009)
  <10.1038/msb.2009.52>) to a graph in order to elucidate its hierarchical structure.
  It also allows graphic visualization of the sorted graph by exporting the results
  to a cytoscape friendly format. Moreover, it offers five different algorithms of
  graph randomization: 1) Randomize a graph with preserving node degrees, 2) with
  preserving similar node degrees, 3) without preserving node degrees, 4) with preserving
  node in-degrees and 5) with preserving node out-degrees.'
