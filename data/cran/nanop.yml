  Tools for Nanoparticle Simulation and Calculation of PDF and
  Total Scattering Structure Function
maintainer: Anton Gagin
description: This software package implements functions to simulate spherical, ellipsoid
  and cubic polyatomic nanoparticles with arbitrary crystal structures and to calculate
  the associated pair-distribution function and X-ray/neutron total-scattering signals.
  It also provides a target function that can be used for simultaneous fitting of
  small- and wide-angle total scattering data in real and reciprocal spaces. The target
  function can be generated either as a sum of weighted residuals for individual datasets
  or as a vector of residuals suitable for optimization using multi-criteria algorithms
  (e.g. Pareto methods).
