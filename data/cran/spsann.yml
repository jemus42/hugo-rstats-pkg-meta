  Optimization of Sample Configurations using Spatial Simulated
  Annealing
maintainer: Alessandro Samuel-Rosa
description: |-
  Methods to optimize sample configurations using spatial simulated annealing. Multiple objective
  functions are implemented for various purposes, such as variogram estimation, spatial trend estimation
  and spatial interpolation. A general purpose spatial simulated annealing function enables the user to
  define his/her own objective function. Solutions for augmenting existing sample configurations and solving
  multi-objective optimization problems are available as well.
