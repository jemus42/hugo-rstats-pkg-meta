description: |-
  Functions and data sets inspired by data sharpening -
  data perturbation to achieve improved performance in
  nonparametric estimation, as described in Choi, E., Hall, P.
  and Rousson, V. (2000) <doi:10.1214/aos/1015957396>.
  Capabilities for enhanced local linear regression function
  and derivative estimation are included, as well as an
  asymptotically correct iterated data sharpening estimator
  for any degree of local polynomial regression estimation.
  A cross-validation-based bandwidth selector is included which,
  in concert with the iterated sharpener, will often provide
  superior performance, according to a median integrated squared
  error criterion.  Sample data sets are provided to illustrate
  function usage.
