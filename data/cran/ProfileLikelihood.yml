  Profile Likelihood for a Parameter in Commonly Used Statistical
  Models
maintainer: Leena Choi
description: This package provides profile likelihoods for a parameter of interest
  in commonly used statistical models. The models include linear models, generalized
  linear models, proportional odds models, linear mixed-effects models, and linear
  models for longitudinal responses fitted by generalized least squares. The package
  also provides plots for normalized profile likelihoods as well as the maximum profile
  likelihood estimates and the kth likelihood support intervals.
