title: Variable Selection for Latent Class Analysis
maintainer: Michael Fop
description: 'Variable selection for latent class analysis for model-based clustering
  of multivariate categorical data. The package implements a general framework for
  selecting the subset of variables with relevant clustering information and discard
  those that are redundant and/or not informative. The variable selection method is
  based on the approach of Fop et al. (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-AOAS1061> and Dean and
  Raftery (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10463-009-0258-9>. Different algorithms are available
  to perform the selection: stepwise, swap-stepwise and evolutionary stochastic search.
  Concomitant covariates used to predict the class membership probabilities can also
  be included in the latent class analysis model. The selection procedure can be run
  in parallel on multiple cores machines.'
