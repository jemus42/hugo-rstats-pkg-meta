title: Pandoc Filters for R
maintainer: Florian Schwendinger
description: |-
  The document converter 'pandoc' <http://pandoc.org/> is widely used
  in the R community. One feature of 'pandoc' is that it can produce and consume
  JSON-formatted abstract syntax trees (AST). This allows to transform a given
  source document into JSON-formatted AST, alter it by so called filters and pass
  the altered JSON-formatted AST back to 'pandoc'. This package provides functions
  which allow to write such filters in native R code.
  Although this package is inspired by the Python package 'pandocfilters'
  <https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>, it provides additional convenience functions which make it simple to use the 'pandocfilters' package as a
  report generator. Since 'pandocfilters' inherits most of it's functionality
  from 'pandoc' it can create documents in many formats
  (for more information see <http://pandoc.org/>) but is also bound to the same
  limitations as 'pandoc'.
