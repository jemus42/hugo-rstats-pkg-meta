description: Implementation of ADMIXTURE for individual ancestry inference in R. Specifically,
  ADMIXTURE is a software tool for maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries
  from multilocus SNP genotype datasets, see <https://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/>.
  Users can use 'radmixture' to calculate ancestry components with different public
  datasets. It is very convenient and fast for personal genotype data. For more details,
  see <https://github.com/wegene-llc/radmixture/blob/master/README.md>.
