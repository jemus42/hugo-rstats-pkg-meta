title: Authentication Services for Azure Active Directory
maintainer: Hong Ooi
description: Provides Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication functionality for
  R users of Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud <https://azure.microsoft.com/>. Use this package
  to obtain 'OAuth' 2.0 tokens for services including Azure Resource Manager, Azure
  Storage and others. It supports both AAD v1.0 and v2.0, as well as multiple authentication
  methods, including device code and resource owner grant. Tokens are cached in a
  user-specific directory obtained using the 'rappdirs' package. The interface is
  based on the 'OAuth' framework in the 'httr' package, but customised and streamlined
  for Azure. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.
