  Extensible Package for Cross-Validation-Based Integration of
  Base Learners
maintainer: Alireza S. Mahani
description: Extends the base classes and methods of EnsembleBase package for cross-validation-based
  integration of base learners. Default implementation calculates average of repeated
  CV errors, and selects the base learner / configuration with minimum average error.
  The package takes advantage of the file method provided in EnsembleBase package
  for writing estimation objects to disk in order to circumvent RAM bottleneck. Special
  save and load methods are provided to allow estimation objects to be saved to permanent
  files on disk, and to be loaded again into temporary files in a later R session.
  The package can be extended, e.g. by adding variants of the current implementation.
