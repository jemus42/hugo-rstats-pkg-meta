title: Insect Phenology Model Evaluation Based on Daily Temperatures
maintainer: Rafael de Andrade Moral
description: Generates predicted stage change days for an insect, based on daily temperatures
  and development rate parameters, as developed by Pollard (2014) <http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/view/ethesisauthor/Pollard=3ACiaran_P=2E=3A=3A.html>.
  A few example datasets are included and implemented for P. vulgatissima, the blue
  willow beetle, but the approach can be readily applied to other species that display
  similar behaviour.
