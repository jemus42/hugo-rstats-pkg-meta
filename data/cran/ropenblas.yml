title: Download, Compile and Link 'OpenBLAS' Library with R
maintainer: Pedro Rafael D. Marinho
description: The 'ropenblas' package (<https://prdm0.github.io/ropenblas/>) is useful
  for users of any 'GNU/Linux' distribution. It will be possible to download, compile
  and link the 'OpenBLAS' library (<https://www.openblas.net/>) with the R language,
  always by the same procedure, regardless of the 'GNU/Linux' distribution used. With
  the 'ropenblas' package it is possible to download, compile and link the latest
  version of the 'OpenBLAS' library even the repositories of the 'GNU/Linux' distribution
  used do not include the latest versions of 'OpenBLAS'. If of interest, older versions
  of the 'OpenBLAS' library may be considered. Linking R with an optimized version
  of 'BLAS' (<http://www.netlib.org/blas/>) may improve the computational performance
  of R code. The 'OpenBLAS' library is an optimized implementation of 'BLAS' that
  can be easily linked to R with the 'ropenblas' package.
