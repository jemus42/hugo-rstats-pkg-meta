title: A Framework for Parallelizing Dependent Tasks
maintainer: Jeremy Coyle
description: |-
  Mechanisms to parallelize dependent tasks in a manner that
  optimizes the compute resources available. It provides access to "delayed"
  computations, which may be parallelized using futures. It is, to an extent,
  a facsimile of the 'Dask' library (<https://dask.org/>), for the 'Python'
  language.
