title: R Functions for Solving Stoichiometric Equations
maintainer: Peter Reichert
description: Given a list of substance compositions, a list of<U+000a>substances involved
  in a process, and a list of constraints in<U+000a>addition to mass conservation
  of elementary constituents, the<U+000a>package contains functions to build the substance
  composition<U+000a>matrix, to analyze the uniqueness of process stoichiometry, and<U+000a>to
  calculate stoichiometric coefficients if process<U+000a>stoichiometry is unique.  (See
  Reichert, P. and Schuwirth, N.,<U+000a>A generic framework for deriving process
  stoichiometry in<U+000a>enviromental models, Environmental Modelling and Software
  25,<U+000a>1241-1251, 2010 for more details.)
