title: Exact and Asymptotic K Sample Permutation Test
maintainer: Qiao Kang
description: An implementation of permutation tests in R, supporting both exact and
  asymptotic K sample test of data locations. The p value of exact tests is found
  using tree algorithms. Tree algorithms treat permutations of input data as tree
  nodes and perform constraint depth-first searches for permutations that fall into
  the critical region of a test systematically. Pruning of tree search and optimisations
  at C level enable exact tests for certain large data sets.
