  1985-2009
maintainer: Jordan S Read
description: Lake temperature records, metadata, and climate drivers for 291 global
  lakes during the time period 1985-2009. Temperature observations were collected
  using satellite and in situ methods. Climatic drivers and geomorphometric characteristics
  were also compiled and are included for each lake. Data are part of the associated
  publication from the Global Lake Temperature Collaboration project (http://www.laketemperature.org).
