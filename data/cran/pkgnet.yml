title: Get Network Representation of an R Package
maintainer: Brian Burns
description: |-
  Tools from the domain of graph theory can be used to quantify the complexity
  and vulnerability to failure of a software package. That is the guiding philosophy
  of this package. 'pkgnet' provides tools to analyze the dependencies between functions
  in an R package and between its imported packages.  See the pkgnet website for vignettes
  and other supplementary information.
