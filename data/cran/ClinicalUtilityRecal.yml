  Scores
maintainer: Anu Mishra
description: Recalibrate risk scores (predicting binary outcomes) to improve clinical
  utility of risk score using weighted logistic or constrained logistic recalibration
  methods. Additionally, produces plots to assess the potential for recalibration
  to improve the clinical utility of a risk model. Methods are described in detail
