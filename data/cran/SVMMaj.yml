title: Implementation of the SVM-Maj Algorithm
maintainer: Hok San Yip
description: |2-

  Implements the SVM-Maj algorithm to train data with support vector machine
  as described in Groenen et al. (2008) <doi:10.1007/s11634-008-0020-9>.
  This algorithm uses two efficient updates, one for linear kernel and one
  for the nonlinear kernel.
