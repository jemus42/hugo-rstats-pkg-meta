title: A Data-Driven Similarity Kernel on Probability Spaces
maintainer: Divyansh Agarwal
description: We present a rank-based Mercer kernel to compute a pair-wise similarity
  metric corresponding to informative representation of data. We tailor the development
  of a kernel to encode our prior knowledge about the data distribution over a probability
  space. The philosophical concept behind our construction is that objects whose feature
  values fall on the extreme of that featureâ€™s probability mass distribution are more
  similar to each other, than objects whose feature values lie closer to the mean.
  Semblance emphasizes features whose values lie far away from the mean of their probability
  distribution. The kernel relies on properties empirically determined from the data
  and does not assume an underlying distribution. The use of feature ranks on a probability
  space ensures that Semblance is computational efficacious, robust to outliers, and
  statistically stable, thus making it widely applicable algorithm for pattern analysis.
  The output from the kernel is a square, symmetric matrix that gives proximity values
  between pairs of observations.
