  Manage and manipulate large collections of R objects stored as
  tape-like files
maintainer: Miron B. Kursa
description: |-
  Storing huge data in RData format causes problems because
  of the necessity to load the whole file to the memory in order
  to access and manipulate objects inside such file; rtape is a
  simple solution to this problem. The package contains several
  wrappers of R built-in serialize/unserialize mechanism allowing
  user to quickly append objects to a tape-like file and later
  iterate over them requiring only one copy of each stored object
  to reside in memory a time.
