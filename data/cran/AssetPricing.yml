title: Optimal Pricing of Assets with Fixed Expiry Date
maintainer: Rolf Turner
description: |-
  Calculates the optimal price of assets (such as
  airline flight seats, hotel room bookings) whose value
  becomes zero after a fixed ``expiry date''.  Assumes
  potential customers arrive (possibly in groups) according
  to a known inhomogeneous Poisson process.  Also assumes a
  known time-varying elasticity of demand (price sensitivity)
  function.  Uses elementary techniques based on ordinary
  differential equations.  Uses the package deSolve to effect
  the solution of these differential equations.
