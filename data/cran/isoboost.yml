title: Isotonic Boosting Classification Rules
maintainer: David Conde
description: |-
  In classification problems a monotone relation between some
  predictors and the classes may be assumed. In this package 'isoboost'
  we propose new boosting algorithms, based on LogitBoost, that
  incorporate this isotonicity information, yielding more accurate
  and easily interpretable rules.
