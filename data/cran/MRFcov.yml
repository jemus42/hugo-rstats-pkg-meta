title: Markov Random Fields with Additional Covariates
maintainer: Nicholas J Clark
description: |-
  Approximate node interaction parameters of Markov Random Fields
  graphical networks. Models can incorporate additional covariates, allowing users to estimate
  how interactions between nodes in the graph are predicted to change across
  covariate gradients. The general methods implemented in this package are described
  in Clark et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/ecy.2221>.
