title: Implementation of Spirometry Equations
maintainer: Theodore Lytras
description: |-
  Implementation of various spirometry equations
  in R, currently the GLI-2012 (Global Lung Initiative;
  Quanjer et al. 2012 <doi:10.1183/09031936.00080312>) and the
  NHANES3 (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;
  Hankinson et al. 1999 <doi:10.1164/ajrccm.159.1.9712108>)
  equations.
  Contains user-friendly functions to calculate predicted
  and LLN (Lower Limit of Normal) values for different
  spirometric parameters such as FEV1 (Forced Expiratory
  Volume in 1 second), FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), etc,
  and to convert absolute spirometry measurements
  to percent (%) predicted and z-scores.
