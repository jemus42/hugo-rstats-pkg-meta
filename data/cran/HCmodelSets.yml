  Variables
maintainer: H. H. Hoeltgebaum
description: Software for performing the reduction, exploratory and model selection
  phases of the procedure proposed by Cox, D.R. and Battey, H.S. (2017) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1703764114>
  for sparse regression when the number of potential explanatory variables far exceeds
  the sample size. The software supports linear regression, likelihood-based fitting
  of generalized linear regression models and the proportional hazards model fitted
  by partial likelihood.
