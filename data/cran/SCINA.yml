description: An automatic cell type detection and assignment algorithm for single
  cell RNA-Seq and Cytof/FACS data. 'SCINA' is capable of assigning cell type identities
  to a pool of cells profiled by scRNA-Seq or Cytof/FACS data with prior knowledge
  of markers, such as genes and protein symbols that are highly or lowly expressed
  in each category. See Zhang Z, et al (2019) <doi:10.3390/genes10070531> for more
  details.
