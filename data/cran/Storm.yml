title: Write Storm Bolts in R using the Storm Multi-Language Protocol.
maintainer: Allen Day
description: |-
  Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. Similar to how
  Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm
  provides a set of general primitives for doing real-time computation.

  Storm includes a "Multi-Language" (or "Multilang") Protocol to allow
  implementation of Bolts and Spouts in languages other than Java.  This R
  extension provides implementations of utility functions to allow an application
  developer to focus on application-specific functionality rather than Storm/R
  communications plumbing.
