title: XHMM R scripts
maintainer: Menachem Fromer
description: R scripts for plotting and assessing XHMM whole-exome-sequencing-based
  CNV calls. XHMM (eXome Hidden Markov Model) is a C++ software package (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm)
  written to call copy number variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects,
  where exome capture was used (or targeted sequencing, more generally). This R package
  enables the user to visualize both the PCA normalization performed by XHMM and the
  CNVs it has called.
