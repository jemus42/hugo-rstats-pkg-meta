  Cross-Validation
maintainer: Sacha Epskamp
description: |-
  Description: Uses k-fold cross-validation and elastic-net regularization to estimate the
  Ising model on binary data. Produces 3D plots of the cost function as a function
  of the tuning parameter in addition to the optimal network structure.
