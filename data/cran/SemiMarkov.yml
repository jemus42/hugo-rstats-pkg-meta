maintainer: Agnieszka Listwon-Krol
description: "Functions for fitting multi-state semi-Markov models to longitudinal
  data. A parametric maximum likelihood estimation method adapted to deal with Exponential,
  Weibull and Exponentiated Weibull distributions is considered. Right-censoring can
  be taken into account and both constant and time-varying covariates can be included
  using a Cox proportional model. Reference: A. Krol and P. Saint-Pierre (2015) \t<doi:10.18637/jss.v066.i06>."
