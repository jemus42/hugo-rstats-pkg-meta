title: Stochastic Mortality Modelling
maintainer: Andres Villegas
description: |-
  Implementation of the family of generalised age-period-cohort
  stochastic mortality models. This family of models encompasses many models
  proposed in the actuarial and demographic literature including the
  Lee-Carter (1992) <doi:10.2307/2290201> and
  the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1539-6975.2006.00195.x> models.
  It includes functions for fitting mortality models, analysing their
  goodness-of-fit and performing mortality projections and simulations.
