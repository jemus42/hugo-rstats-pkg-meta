title: Permutation Testing in High-Dimensional Linear Models
maintainer: Jesse Hemerik
description: |-
  Provides permutation methods for testing in high-dimensional linear models.
  The tests are often robust against heteroscedasticity and non-normality
  and usually perform well under anti-sparsity.
  See Hemerik and Goeman (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11749-017-0571-1>.
