  Model Species Distributions by Estimating the Probability of
  Occurrence Using Presence-Only Data
maintainer: Roeland Kindt
description: Provides a likelihood-based approach to modeling species distributions
  using presence-only data. In contrast to the popular software program MAXENT, this
  approach yields estimates of the probability of occurrence, which is a natural descriptor
  of a species' distribution.
