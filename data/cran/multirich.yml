title: Calculate Multivariate Richness via UTC and sUTC
maintainer: Alexander Keyel
description: |-
  Functions to calculate Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) and scaled
  Unique Trait Combinations (sUTC) as measures of multivariate richness. The
  package can also calculate beta-diversity for trait richness and can
  partition this into nestedness-related and turnover components. The code
  will also calculate several measures of overlap.
