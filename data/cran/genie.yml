  A New, Fast, and Outlier Resistant Hierarchical Clustering
  Algorithm
maintainer: Marek Gagolewski
description: |-
  A new hierarchical clustering linkage criterion:
  the Genie algorithm links two clusters in such a way that a chosen
  economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini index) of the cluster
  sizes does not increase drastically above a given threshold. Benchmarks
  indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced method:
  it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of
  the clustering quality while retaining the single linkage speed,
