  Statistical Analysis of Amplicon Data of the Same Sample to
  Identify Artefacts
maintainer: Anja Lange
description: Increasingly powerful techniques for high-throughput sequencing open
  the possibility to comprehensively characterize microbial communities, including
  rare species. However, a still unresolved issue are the substantial error rates
  in the experimental process generating these sequences. To overcome these limitations
  we propose an approach, where each sample is split and the same amplification and
  sequencing protocol is applied to both halves. This procedure should allow to detect
  likely PCR and sequencing artifacts, and true rare species by comparison of the
  results of both parts. The AmpliconDuo package, whereas amplicon duo from here on
  refers to the two amplicon data sets of a split sample, is intended to help interpret
  the obtained read frequency distribution across split samples, and to filter the
  false positive reads.
