description: SCEPtER pipeline for estimating the stellar age for double-lined detached
  binary systems. The observational constraints adopted in the recovery are the effective
  temperature, the metallicity [Fe/H], the mass, and the radius of the two stars.
  The results are obtained adopting a maximum likelihood technique over a grid of
  pre-computed stellar models.
