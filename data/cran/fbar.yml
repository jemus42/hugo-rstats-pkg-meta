title: An Extensible Approach to Flux Balance Analysis
maintainer: Max Conway
description: |-
  A simple package for Flux Balance Analysis and related
  metabolic modeling techniques. Functions are provided for: parsing
  models in tabular format, converting parsed metabolic models to input
  formats for common linear programming solvers, and
  evaluating and applying gene-protein-reaction mappings. In addition, there
  are wrappers to parse a model, select a solver, find the metabolic fluxes,
  and return the results applied to the original model. Compared to other
  packages in this field, this package puts a much heavier focus on
  providing reusable components that can be used in the design of new
  implementation of new techniques, in particular those that involve large
  parameter sweeps.
