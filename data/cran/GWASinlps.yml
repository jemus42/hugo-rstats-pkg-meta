  Nonlocal Prior Based Iterative SNP Selection Tool for
  Genome-Wide Association Studies
maintainer: Nilotpal Sanyal
description: Performs variable selection with data from Genome-wide association studies
  (GWAS) combining, in an iterative variable selection framework, the computational
  efficiency of the screen-and-select approach based on some association learning
  and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of nonlocal
  priors, as described in Sanyal et al. (2018).
