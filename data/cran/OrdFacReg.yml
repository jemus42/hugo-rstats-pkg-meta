  Least Squares, Logistic, and Cox-Regression with Ordered

description: In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in assessing
  the association between one or more ordinal explanatory variables and an outcome
  variable, at the same time adjusting for covariates of any type. The outcome variable
  may be continuous, binary, or represent censored survival times. In the absence
  of a precise knowledge of the response function, using monotonicity constraints
  on the ordinal variables improves efficiency in estimating parameters, especially
  when sample sizes are small. This package implements an active set algorithm that
  efficiently computes such estimators.
