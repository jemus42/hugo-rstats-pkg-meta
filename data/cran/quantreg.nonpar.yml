title: Nonparametric Series Quantile Regression
maintainer: Ivan Fernandez-Val
description: Implements the nonparametric quantile regression method developed by
  Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Fernandez-Val (2011) to partially linear quantile models.
  Provides point estimates of the conditional quantile function and its derivatives
  based on series approximations to the nonparametric part of the model. Provides
  pointwise and uniform confidence intervals using analytic and resampling methods.
