title: Sensitivity Analysis for Publication Bias in Meta-Analyses
maintainer: Maya B. Mathur
description: |-
  Performs sensitivity analysis for publication bias in meta-analyses (per Mathur & VanderWeele, 2020 [<https://osf.io/s9dp6>]).
  These analyses enable statements such as: "For publication bias to shift the observed point estimate to the null,
  'significant' results would need to be at least 30-fold more likely to be published than negative or 'nonsignificant'
  results." Comparable statements can be made regarding shifting to a chosen non-null value or shifting the confidence
  interval. Provides a worst-case meta-analytic point estimate under maximal publication bias obtained simply by conducting
  a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and "nonsignificant" studies.
