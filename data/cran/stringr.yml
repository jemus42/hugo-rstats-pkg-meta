title: Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: |-
  A consistent, simple and easy to use set of
  wrappers around the fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and
  argument names (and positions) are consistent, all functions deal with
  "NA"'s and zero length vectors in the same way, and the output from
  one function is easy to feed into the input of another.
