title: Relabelling MCMC Outputs of Mixture Models
maintainer: Panagiotis Papastamoulis
description: The Bayesian estimation of mixture models (and more general hidden Markov
  models) suffers from the label switching phenomenon, making the MCMC output non-identifiable.
  This package can be used in order to deal with this problem using various relabelling
  algorithms.
