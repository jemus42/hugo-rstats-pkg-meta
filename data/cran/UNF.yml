title: Tools for Creating Universal Numeric Fingerprints for Data
maintainer: Thomas Leeper
description: |-
  Computes a universal numeric fingerprint (UNF) for an R data
  object. UNF is a cryptographic hash or signature that can be used to uniquely
  identify (a version of) a rectangular dataset, or a subset thereof. UNF can
  be used, in tandem with a DOI, to form a persistent citation to a versioned
  dataset.
