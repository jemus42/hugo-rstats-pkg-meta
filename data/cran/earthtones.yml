title: Derive a Color Palette from a Particular Location on Earth
maintainer: Will Cornwell
description: |-
  Downloads a satellite image via Google Maps/Earth (these are
  originally from a variety of aerial photography sources),
  translates the image into a perceptually uniform color space,
  runs one of a few different clustering algorithms on the colors in the image
  searching for a user-supplied number of colors,
  and returns the resulting color palette.
