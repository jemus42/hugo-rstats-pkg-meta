title: Hierarchical Block Matrix Analysis
maintainer: Yoli Shavit
description: A package for building hierarchical block matrices from association matrices
  and for performing multi-scale analysis. It specifically targets chromatin contact
  maps, generated from high-throughput chromosome conformation capture data, such
  as 5C and Hi-C, and provides methods for detecting movements and for computing chain
  hierarchy and region communicability across scales.
