maintainer: Yingsong Hu
description: 'R parallel implementation of Local Outlier Factor(LOF) which uses multiple
  CPUs to significantly speed up the LOF computation for large datasets. (Note: The
  overall performance depends on the computers especially the number of the cores).It
  also supports multiple k values to be calculated in parallel, as well as various
  distance measures in addition to the default Euclidean distance.'
