title: The Multivariate Normal and t Distributions
maintainer: Adelchi Azzalini
description: |-
  Functions are provided for computing the density and the
  distribution function of multivariate normal and "t" random variables,
  and for generating random vectors sampled from these distributions.
  Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods; different routines
  are used in the case d=1, d=2, d>2, if d denotes the number of dimensions.
