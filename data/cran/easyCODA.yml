description: |-
  Univariate and multivariate methods for compositional data
  analysis, based on logratios. The package implements the approach in the
  book Compositional Data Analysis in Practice by Michael Greenacre (2018),
  where accent is given to simple pairwise logratios. Selection can be made
  of logratios that account for a maximum percentage of logratio variance.
  Various multivariate analyses of logratios are included in the package.
