title: Social Position Indicators Construction Toolbox
maintainer: Julie Falcon
description: Provides to sociologists (and related scientists) a toolbox to facilitate
  the construction of social position indicators from survey data. Social position
  indicators refer to what is commonly known as social class and social status. There
  exists in the sociological literature many theoretical conceptualisation and empirical
  operationalization of social class and social status. This first version of the
  package offers tools to construct the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational
  Status (ISEI) and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides tools to convert
  several occupational classifications (PCS82, PCS03, and ISCO08) into a common one
  (ISCO88) to facilitate data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i.e. group)
  modalities of social position indicators.
