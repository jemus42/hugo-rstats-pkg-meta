  Spectral Response of Water Wells to Harmonic Strain and Pressure
  Signals
maintainer: Andrew J Barbour
description: |-
  Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
  of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or pressurization, or analyze
  measured responses. There are
  two classes of models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of
  Kitagawa et al (2011, <doi:10.1029/2010JB007794>),
  and (2) for open wells, based on the models of
  Cooper et al (1965, <doi:10.1029/JZ070i016p03915>),
  Hsieh et al (1987, <doi:10.1029/WR023i010p01824>),
  Rojstaczer (1988, <doi:10.1029/JB093iB11p13619>), and
  Liu et al (1989, <doi:10.1029/JB094iB07p09453>). These models treat
  strain (or aquifer head) as an input to the
  physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The
  applicable frequency band of these models is characteristic of seismic
  waves, atmospheric pressure fluctuations, and solid earth tides.
