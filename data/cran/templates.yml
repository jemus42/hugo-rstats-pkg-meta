title: A System for Working with Templates
maintainer: Sebastian Warnholz
description: |-
  Provides tools to work with template code and text in R. It aims to
  provide a simple substitution mechanism for R-expressions inside these
  templates. Templates can be written in other languages like 'SQL', can
  simply be represented by characters in R, or can themselves be R-expressions
  or functions.
