title: Multivariate Outlier Detection and Replacement
maintainer: Michael Mayer
description: |-
  Provides a random forest based implementation of
  the method described in Chapter 7.1.2 (Regression model based anomaly
  detection) of Chandola et al. (2009)
  <doi.acm.org/10.1145/1541880.1541882>. It works as follows: Each
  numeric variable is regressed onto all other variables by a random
  forest. If the scaled absolute difference between observed value and
  out-of-bag prediction of the corresponding random forest is
  suspiciously large, then a value is considered an outlier. The package
  offers different options to replace such outliers, e.g. by realistic
  values found via predictive mean matching. Once the method is trained
  on a reference data, it can be applied to new data.
