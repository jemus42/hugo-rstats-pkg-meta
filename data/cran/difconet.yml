  Estimation of DIFferential COexpressed NETworks using diverse and user metrics.
  This package is basically used for three functions related to the estimation
  of differential coexpression.
  First, to estimate differential coexpression where
  the coexpression is estimated, by default, by Spearman correlation. For this,
  a metric to compare two correlation distributions is needed. The package includes
  6 metrics. Some of them needs a threshold. A new metric can also be specified as
  a user function with specific parameters (see difconet.run). The significance is
  be estimated by permutations.
  Second, to generate datasets with controlled differential correlation data. This
  is done by either adding noise, or adding specific correlation structure.
  Third, to show the results of differential correlation analyses. Please see
