  Estimate and Account for Tumor Purity in Cancer Methylation Data
  Analysis
maintainer: Yufang Qin
description: The proportion of cancer cells in solid tumor sample, known as the tumor
  purity, has adverse impact on a variety of data analyses if not properly accounted
  for. We develop 'InfiniumPurify', which is a comprehensive R package for estimating
  and accounting for tumor purity based on DNA methylation Infinium 450k array data.
  'InfiniumPurify' provides functionalities for tumor purity estimation. In addition,
  it can perform differential methylation detection and tumor sample clustering with
  the consideration of tumor purities.
