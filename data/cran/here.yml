  Constructs paths to your project's files.
  The 'here()' function uses a reasonable heuristics to find your project's
  files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package
  is loaded. Use it as a drop-in replacement for 'file.path()', it will always
  locate the files relative to your project root.
