title: Query-Driven Pipeline Execution and Query Templates
maintainer: Roland Stevenson
description: |-
  Runs a function iteratively over each row of either a dataframe
  or the results of a query.  Use the 'BigQuery' and 'DBI' wrappers to
  iteratively pass each row of query results to a function.  If a field
  contains a 'JSON' string, it will be converted to an object.  This is
  helpful for queries that return 'JSON' strings that represent objects.
  These fields can then be treated as objects by the pipeline.
