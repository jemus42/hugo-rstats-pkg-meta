  Weights
maintainer: Jean-Francois Plante
description: |-
  Calculates the nonparametric adaptive MAMSE
  weights for univariate, right-censored or multivariate data.
  The MAMSE weights can be used in a weighted likelihood or to
  define a mixture of empirical distribution functions. The package
  includes functions for the MAMSE weighted Kaplan-Meier estimate
  and for MAMSE weighted ROC curves.
