title: Areal Weighted Interpolation
maintainer: Christopher Prener
description: |-
  A pipeable, transparent implementation of areal weighted interpolation
  with support for interpolating multiple variables in a single function call.
  These tools provide a full-featured workflow for validation and estimation
  that fits into both modern data management (e.g. tidyverse) and spatial
  data (e.g. sf) frameworks.
