title: Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation with Vine Copulas
maintainer: Thomas Nagler
description: |-
  Implements the vine copula based kernel density estimator of
  Nagler and Czado (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.07.003>. The estimator does
  not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore well suited for
  high-dimensional applications.
