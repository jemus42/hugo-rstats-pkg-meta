  Calculating Proportionality Between Vectors of Compositional
  Data
maintainer: Thomas Quinn
description: |-
  The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
  correlation-based analyses. However, correlation lacks validity when
  applied to relative data, including count data generated by next-generation
  sequencing. This package implements several metrics for proportionality, including
  phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>] and
  rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>]. This package also
  implements several metrics for differential proportionality. Unlike correlation,
  these measures give the same result for both relative and absolute data.
