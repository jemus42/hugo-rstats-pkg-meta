  A Collection of Tools for the Analysis of Remote Acoustic
  Telemetry Data
maintainer: Ross Dwyer
description: Designed to facilitate the assimilation, analysis and synthesis of animal
  location and movement data collected by the VEMCO suite of acoustic transmitters
  and receivers. As well as database and geographic information capabilities the principal
  feature of VTrack is the qualification and identification of ecologically relevant
  events from the acoustic detection and sensor data. This procedure condenses the
  acoustic detection database by orders of magnitude, greatly enhancing the synthesis
  of acoustic detection data.
