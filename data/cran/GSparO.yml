description: Approaches a group sparse solution of an underdetermined linear system.
  It implements the proximal gradient algorithm to solve a lower regularization model
  of group sparse learning. For details, please refer to the paper "Y. Hu, C. Li,
  K. Meng, J. Qin and X. Yang. Group sparse optimization via l_{p,q} regularization.
