  Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time
  Series
maintainer: Christoph Sax
description: |-
  Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate and
  interpolate a low frequency time series to a higher frequency series, where
  either the sum, the mean, the first or the last value of the resulting
  high frequency series is consistent with the low frequency series. Temporal
  disaggregation can be performed with or without one or more high frequency
  indicator series. Contains the methods of Chow-Lin, Santos-Silva-Cardoso,
  Fernandez, Litterman, Denton and Denton-Cholette, summarized in Sax and
  Steiner (2013) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2013-028>. Supports most R time series
  classes.
