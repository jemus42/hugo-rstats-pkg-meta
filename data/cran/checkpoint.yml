  Install Packages from Snapshots on the Checkpoint Server for
  Reproducibility
maintainer: Hong Ooi
description: |-
  The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
  reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages
  as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
  machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the
  packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
  exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
  are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
  later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
  checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
  time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
  refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the "Microsoft R Archived Network"
  server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>). Immediately after completion
  of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the
  archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.
