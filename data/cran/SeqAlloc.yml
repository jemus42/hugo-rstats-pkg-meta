title: Sequential Allocation for Prospective Experiments
maintainer: Xiaoshu Zhu
description: |-
  Potential randomization schemes are prospectively evaluated when
  units are assigned to treatment arms upon entry into the experiment. The schemes
  are evaluated for balance on covariates and on predictability (i.e., how well
  could a site worker guess the treatment of the next unit enrolled).
