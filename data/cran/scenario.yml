title: Construct Reduced Trees with Predefined Nodal Structures
maintainer: Sean Turner
description: |-
  Uses the neural gas algorithm to construct
  a scenario tree for use in multi-stage stochastic programming.
  The primary input is a set of initial scenarios or realizations
  of a disturbance. The scenario tree nodal structure must be
  predefined using a scenario tree nodal partition matrix.
