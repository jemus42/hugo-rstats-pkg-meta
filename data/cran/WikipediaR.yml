maintainer: Avner Bar-Hen
description: |-
  Provides an interface to the Wikipedia web application programming
  interface (API), using internet connexion.Three functions provide details for
  a specific Wikipedia page : all links that are present, all pages that link
  to, all the contributions (revisions for main pages, and discussions for talk
  pages). Two functions provide details for a specific user : all contributions,
  and general information (as name, gender, rights or groups). It provides
  additional information compared to others packages, as WikipediR. It does not
  need login. The multiplex network that can be constructed from the results
  of the functions of WikipediaR can be modeled as Stochastic Block Model as in
  Barbillon P., Donnet, S., Lazega E., and Bar-Hen A. : Stochastic Block Models
  for Multiplex networks: an application to networks of researchers, ArXiv
