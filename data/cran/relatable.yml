  Functions for Mapping Key-Value Pairs, Many-to-Many,
  One-to-Many, and Many-to-One Relations
maintainer: Dominic Jarkey
description: Functions to safely map from a vector of keys to a vector of values,
  determine properties of a given relation, or ensure a relation conforms to a given
  type, such as many-to-many, one-to-many, injective, surjective, or bijective. Permits
  default return values for use similar to a vectorised switch statement, as well
  as safely handling large vectors, NAs, and duplicate mappings.
