version: 0.1.4
title: R6 Mathematical Sets Interface
maintainer: Raphael Sonabend
description: An object-oriented package for mathematical sets, upgrading the current
  gold-standard {sets}. Many forms of mathematical sets are implemented, including
  (countably finite) sets, tuples, intervals (countably infinite or uncountable),
  and fuzzy variants. Wrappers extend functionality by allowing symbolic representations
  of complex operations on sets, including unions, (cartesian) products, exponentiation,
  and differences (asymmetric and symmetric).
