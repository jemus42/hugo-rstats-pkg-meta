title: Spatially Balanced Sampling
maintainer: Francesco Pantalone
description: Selection of spatially balanced samples. In particular, the implemented
  sampling designs allow to select probability samples well spread over the population
  of interest, in any dimension and using any distance function (e.g. Euclidean distance,
  Manhattan distance). For more details, Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201600194>
  and Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017) <arXiv:1710.09116>. The implementation has
  been done in C++ through the use of 'Rcpp' and 'RcppArmadillo'.
