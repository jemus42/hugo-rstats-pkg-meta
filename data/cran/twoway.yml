maintainer: Michael Friendly
description: |-
  Carries out analyses of two-way tables with one observation per cell, together with graphical displays
  for an additive fit and
  a diagnostic plot for removable 'non-additivity' via a power transformation of the response.
  It implements Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis methods, including a
  1-degree-of-freedom test for row*column 'non-additivity', linear in the row and column effects.
