title: Smooth Non-Parametric Frontier Analysis
maintainer: Taylor McKenzie
description: |-
  Fitting of non-parametric production frontiers for use in efficiency analysis.
  Methods are provided for both a smooth analogue of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a
  non-parametric analogue of Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Frontiers are constructed for
  multiple inputs and a single output using constrained kernel smoothing as in
  Racine et al. (2009), which allow for the imposition of monotonicity and concavity constraints
  on the estimated frontier.
