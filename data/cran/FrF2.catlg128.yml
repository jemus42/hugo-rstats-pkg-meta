title: Catalogues of resolution IV 128 run 2-level fractional<U+000a>factorials up
  to 33 factors that do have 5-letter words
maintainer: Ulrike Groemping
description: This package provides catalogues of resolution IV regular<U+000a>fractional
  factorial designs in 128 runs for up to 33 2-level<U+000a>factors. The catalogues
  are complete, excluding resolution IV<U+000a>designs without 5-letter words, because
  these do not add value<U+000a>for a search for clear designs. The previous package
  version<U+000a>1.0 with complete catalogues up to 24 runs (24 runs and a<U+000a>namespace
  added later) can be downloaded from the authors<U+000a>website.
