title: Using the Theory of Belief Functions
maintainer: Claude Boivin
description: Using the Theory of Belief Functions for evidence calculus. Basic probability
  assignments, or mass functions, can be defined on the subsets of a set of possible
  values and combined. A mass function can be extended to a larger frame. Marginalization,
  i.e. reduction to a smaller frame can also be done. These features can be combined
  to analyze small belief networks and take into account situations where information
  cannot be satisfactorily described by probability distributions.
