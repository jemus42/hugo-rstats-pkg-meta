title: Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests
maintainer: Connor Dowd
description: |-
  Fast randomization based two sample tests.
  Testing the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution
  using randomization to create p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There is also a very efficient test
  based on the Wasserstein Distance. The default test 'two_sample' builds on the
  Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling.
  We also include the permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
