  Structural Equation Modeling Using the Reticular Action Model

description: We rewrite of RAMpath software developed by John McArdle and Steven Boker
  as an R package. In addition to performing regular SEM analysis through the R package
  lavaan, RAMpath has unique features.  First, it can generate path diagrams according
  to a given model. Second, it can display path tracing rules through path diagrams
  and decompose total effects into their respective direct and indirect effects as
  well as decompose variance and covariance into individual bridges. Furthermore,
  RAMpath can fit dynamic system models automatically based on latent change scores
  and generate vector field plots based upon results obtained from a bivariate dynamic
  system. Starting version 0.4, RAMpath can conduct power analysis for both univariate
  and bivariate latent change score models.
