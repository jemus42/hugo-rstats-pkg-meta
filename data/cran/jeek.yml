description: 'Provides a fast and scalable joint estimator for integrating additional
  knowledge in learning multiple related sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (JEEK).
  The JEEK algorithm can be used to fast estimate multiple related precision matrices
  in a large-scale. For instance, it can identify multiple gene networks from multi-context
  gene expression datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional
  and heterogeneous data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated
  data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities. Please run demo(jeek)
  to learn the basic functions provided by this package. For further details, please
  read the original paper: Beilun Wang, Arshdeep Sekhon, Yanjun Qi "A Fast and Scalable
  Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge in Learning Multiple Related
  Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models" (ICML 2018) <arXiv:1806.00548>.'
