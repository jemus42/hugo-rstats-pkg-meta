  (Precipitation) Frequency Analysis and Variability with
  L-Moments from 'lmom'
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  It is an extension of 'lmom' R package: 'pel','cdf',qua' function
  families are lumped and called from one function per each family respectively in order to
  create robust automatic tools to fit data  with different probability
  distributions and then to estimate probability values and return periods.  The implemented functions are able to manage time series with constant and/or missing values without stopping
  the execution with error messages. The package also contains tools to  calculate several  indices based on variability (e.g. 'SPI' , Standardized
  Precipitation Index, see <https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi> and <http://spei.csic.es/>) for multiple time series or spatio-temporal gridded values.
