title: Retinal Reconstruction Program
maintainer: David C. Sterratt
description: |-
  Reconstructs retinae by morphing a flat surface with cuts (a
  dissected flat-mount retina) onto a curvilinear surface (the standard retinal
  shape). It can estimate the position of a point on the intact adult retina
  to within 8 degrees of arc (3.6% of nasotemporal axis). The coordinates in
  reconstructed retinae can be transformed to visuotopic coordinates.
