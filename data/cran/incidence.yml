title: Compute, Handle, Plot and Model Incidence of Dated Events
maintainer: Zhian N. Kamvar
description: Provides functions and classes to compute, handle and visualise incidence
  from dated events for a defined time interval. Dates can be provided in various
  standard formats. The class 'incidence' is used to store computed incidence and
  can be easily manipulated, subsetted, and plotted. In addition, log-linear models
  can be fitted to 'incidence' objects using 'fit'. This package is part of the RECON
  (<http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/>) toolkit for outbreak analysis.
