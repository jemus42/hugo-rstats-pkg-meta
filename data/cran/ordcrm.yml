  Likelihood-Based Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) Dose
  Finding Designs
maintainer: Emily V. Dressler
description: |-
  Provides the setup and calculations needed
  to run a likelihood-based continual reassessment method (CRM)
  dose finding trial and performs simulations to assess design
  performance under various scenarios. 3 dose finding designs
  are included in this package: ordinal proportional odds model
  (POM) CRM, ordinal continuation ratio (CR) model CRM, and the
  binary 2-parameter logistic model CRM.
  These functions allow customization of design characteristics
  to vary sample size, cohort sizes, target dose-limiting
  toxicity (DLT) rates, discrete or continuous dose levels,
  combining ordinal grades 0 and 1 into one category, and
  incorporate safety and/or stopping rules.
  For POM and CR model designs, ordinal toxicity grades are
  specified by common terminology criteria for adverse events
  (CTCAE) version 4.0.
  Function 'pseudodata' creates the necessary starting models
  for these 3 designs, and function 'nextdose' estimates the
  next dose to test in a cohort of patients for a target DLT
  rate.
  We also provide the function 'crmsimulations' to assess the
  performance of these 3 dose finding designs under various
  scenarios.
