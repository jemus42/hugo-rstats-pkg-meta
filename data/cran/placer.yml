title: PLastic ACcumulation Estimate using R (PLACER)
maintainer: Davi Castro-Tavares
description: |-
  Assessment of the prevalence of plastic
  debris in bird nests based on bootstrap replicates. The package allows for
  calculating bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the estimated prevalence
  of debris. Combined with a Bayesian approach, the resampling simulations can
  be also used to define appropriate sample sizes to detect prevalence of plastics.
  The method has wide application, and can also be applied to estimate confidence
  intervals and define sample sizes for the prevalence of plastics ingested by any
  other organisms. The method is described in Tavares et al. (Submitted).
