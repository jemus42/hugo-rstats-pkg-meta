title: Sampling Variance Estimation
maintainer: Emilio Lopez Escobar
description: Functions to calculate some point estimators and estimating their variance
  under unequal probability sampling without replacement. Single and two stage sampling
  designs are considered. Some approximations for the second order inclusion probabilities
  (joint inclusion probabilities) are available (sample and population based). A variety
  of Jackknife variance estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written
  in C (compiled) code for faster results. The functions incorporate some performance
  improvements for faster results with large datasets.
