title: Some Movies to Illustrate Concepts in Statistics
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Provides movies to help students to understand statistical
  concepts.  The 'rpanel' package  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanel>
  is used to create interactive plots that move to illustrate key statistical
  ideas and methods.  There are movies to: visualise probability distributions
  (including user-supplied ones); illustrate sampling distributions of the
  sample mean (central limit theorem), the median, the sample maximum
  (extremal types theorem) and (the Fisher transformation of the) Pearson
  product moment correlation coefficient; examine the influence of an
  individual observation in simple linear regression; illustrate key concepts
  in statistical hypothesis testing. Also provided are dpqr functions for the
  distribution of the Fisher transformation of the correlation coefficient
  under sampling from a bivariate normal distribution.
