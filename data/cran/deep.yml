version: 0.1.0
title: A Neural Networks Framework
maintainer: Brian
description: |-
  Explore neural networks in a layer oriented way, the framework
  is intended to give the user total control of the
  internals of a net without much effort. Use classes like PerceptronLayer
  to create a layer of Percetron neurons, and specify how many you want. The
  package does all the tricky stuff internally leaving you focused in what
  you want. I wrote this package during a neural networks course to help me
  with the problem set.
