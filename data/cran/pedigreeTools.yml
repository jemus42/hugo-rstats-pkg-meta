title: Versatile Functions for Working with Pedigrees
maintainer: Ana Ines Vazquez
description: |-
  Tools to sort, edit and prune pedigrees and to extract the inbreeding coefficients
  and the relationship matrix (includes code for pedigrees from self-pollinated species).
  The use of pedigree data is central to genetics research within the animal and plant breeding communities to predict
  breeding values. The relationship matrix between the individuals can be derived from pedigree structure following
  the algorithms described for example in Vazquez et al., 2010 <doi:10.2527/jas.2009-1952>.
