title: ROBustness in Network
maintainer: Valeria Policastro
description: Assesses the robustness of the community structure of a network found
  by one or more community detection algorithm to give indications about their reliability.
  It detects if the community structure found by a set of algorithms is statistically
  significant and compares the different selected detection algorithms on the same
  network. robin helps to choose among different community detection algorithms the
  one that better fits the network of interest. Reference in Annamaria Carissimo,
