title: Multi-Parent Population QTL Analysis
maintainer: Vincent Garin
description: |-
  Analysis of experimental multi-parent populations to detect
  regions of the genome (called quantitative trait loci, QTLs)
  influencing phenotypic traits. The population must be composed of crosses
  between a set of at least three parents (e.g. factorial design,
  'diallel', or nested association mapping). The functions cover data
  processing, QTL detection, and results visualization. The implemented
  methodology is described by Garin, Wimmer, Mezmouk, Malosetti and
  van Eeuwijk (2017) <doi:10.1007/s00122-017-2923-3>.
