  Easily Visualize Data from 'ERDDAP' Servers via the 'rerddap'
  Package
maintainer: Roy Mendelssohn
description: Easily visualize and animate 'tabledap' and 'griddap' objects obtained
  via the 'rerddap' package in a simple one-line command,  using either base graphics
  or 'ggplot2' graphics. 'plotdap' handles extracting and reshaping the data,  map
  projections and continental outlines.  Optionally the data can be animated through
  time using the 'gganmiate' package.
