title: High Performance Colour Space Manipulation
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  The encoding of colour can be handled in many different ways, using
  different colour spaces. As different colour spaces have different uses,
  efficient conversion between these representations are important. The
  'farver' package provides a set of functions that gives access to very fast
  colour space conversion and comparisons implemented in C++, and offers
  speed improvements over the 'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices'
  package.
