title: Markov Chain-Based Cost-Optimal Control Charts
maintainer: Balazs Dobi
description: Functions for cost-optimal control charts with a focus on health care
  applications. Compared to assumptions in traditional control chart theory, here,
  we allow random shift sizes, random repair and random sampling times. The package
  focuses on X-bar charts with a sample size of 1 (representing the monitoring of
  a single patient at a time). The methods are described in Zempleni et al. (2004)
  <doi:10.1002/asmb.521>, Dobi and Zempleni (2019) <doi:10.1002/qre.2518> and Dobi
  and Zempleni (2019) <http://ac.inf.elte.hu/Vol_049_2019/129_49.pdf>.
