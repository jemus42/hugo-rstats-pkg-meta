title: Crawler and Scraper for Open Journal System ('OJS')
maintainer: Gaston Becerra
description: |-
  Crawler for 'OJS' pages and scraper for meta-data from articles.
  You can crawl 'OJS' archives, issues, articles, galleys, and search results.
  You can scrap articles meta-data from their head tag in html,
  or from Open Archives Initiative ('OAI') records.
  Most of these functions rely on 'OJS' routing conventions
  (<https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/architecture-routes>).
