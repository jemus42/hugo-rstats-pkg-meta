title: Unified Interface to Parallelization Back-Ends
maintainer: Bernd Bischl
description: |-
  Unified parallelization framework for multiple
  back-end, designed for internal package and interactive usage.  The
  main operation is parallel mapping over lists.  Supports 'local',
  'multicore', 'mpi' and 'BatchJobs' mode.  Allows tagging of the
  parallel operation with a level name that can be later selected by the
  user to switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
