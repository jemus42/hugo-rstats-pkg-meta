title: Robust Clustering Procedures
maintainer: Juan Domingo Gonzalez
description: |-
  A clustering algorithm similar to K-Means is implemented, it has two main advantages,
  namely (a) The estimator is resistant to outliers, that means that results of estimator are still correct when
  there are atypical values in the sample and (b) The estimator is efficient, roughly speaking,
  if there are no outliers in the sample, results will be similar than those obtained by a classic algorithm (K-Means).
  Clustering procedure is carried out by minimizing the overall robust scale so-called tau scale.
