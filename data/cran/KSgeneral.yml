  Computing P-Values of the K-S Test for (Dis)Continuous Null
  Distribution
maintainer: Senren Tan
description: Computes a p-value of the one-sample two-sided (or one-sided, as a special
  case) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, for any fixed critical level, and an arbitrary,
  possibly large sample size for a pre-specified purely discrete, mixed or continuous
  cumulative distribution function (cdf) under the null hypothesis. If a data sample
  is supplied, 'KSgeneral' computes the p-value corresponding to the value of the
  KS test statistic computed based on the user provided data sample. The package 'KSgeneral'
  implements a novel, accurate and efficient method named Exact-KS-FFT, expressing
  the p-value as a double-boundary non-crossing probability for a homogeneous Poisson
  process, which is then efficiently computed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  The package can also be used to compute and plot the complementary cdf of the KS
  statistic which is known to depend on the hypothesized distribution when the latter
  is discontinuous (i.e. purely discrete or mixed).
