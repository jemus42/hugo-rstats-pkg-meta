title: Calculate Upcoming Birthday Dates of Github Repos
maintainer: Bohdan Khomtchouk
description: Software creation is a pretty big deal!  A repository's initial commit
  date can be thought of as its birthday.  Next time, drop in and wish a developer
  (any Github username) a happy birthday of their repo(s).  Or maybe just toast to
  the upcoming anniversary of your own software!  The software life cycle is too short
  not to celebrate!
