maintainer: Tyson S. Barrett
description: |-
  Contains four main functions (i.e., four pieces of furniture):
  table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptive statistics common as Table 1
  in research articles, tableC() which produces a well-formatted table of correlations,
  tableF() which provides frequency counts, and washer() which
  is helpful in cleaning up the data. These furniture-themed functions are designed
  to simplify common tasks in quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools
  are also available.
