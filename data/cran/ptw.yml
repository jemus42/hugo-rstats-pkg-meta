title: Parametric Time Warping
maintainer: Ron Wehrens
description: |-
  Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e. it aims to
  put corresponding features at the same locations. The algorithm
  searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It
  is possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples
  to the same reference, or several samples to several
  references. One can choose between calculating individual
  warpings, or one global warping for a set of samples and one
  reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented: RMS (Root
  Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both
  warping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A
  vignette for the latter is contained in the inst/doc directory
  of the source package - the vignette source can be found on
  the package github site.
