title: Stable Specification Search in Structural Equation Models
maintainer: Ridho Rahmadi
description: |-
  An exploratory and heuristic approach for specification search in
  Structural Equation Modeling. The basic idea is to subsample the original data
  and then search for optimal models on each subset. Optimality is defined through
  two objectives: model fit and parsimony. As these objectives are conflicting,
  we apply a multi-objective optimization methods, specifically NSGA-II, to obtain
  optimal models for the whole range of model complexities. From these optimal
  models, we consider only the relevant model specifications (structures), i.e.,
  those that are both stable (occur frequently) and parsimonious and use those to
  infer a causal model.
