title: Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links
maintainer: Hyung Park
description: 'A major challenge in estimating treatment decision rules from a randomized
  clinical trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline lies in detecting relatively
  small treatment effect modification-related variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates
  interaction effects on treatment outcomes) against a relatively large non-treatment-related
  variability (i.e., the main effects of covariates on treatment outcomes). The class
  of Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model specifically
  designed to estimate a single-index (a linear combination) of the covariates associated
  with the treatment effect modification-related variability, while allowing a nonlinear
  association with the treatment outcomes via flexible link functions. The models
  provide a flexible regression approach to developing treatment decision rules based
  on patients'' data measured at baseline. We refer to Petkova, Tarpey, Su, and Ogden
  (2017) <doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxw035> and "A constrained single-index model
  for estimating interactions between a treatment and covariates" (under review, 2019)
  for detail. The main function of this package is simml().'
