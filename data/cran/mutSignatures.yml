title: Decipher Mutational Signatures from Somatic Mutational Catalogs
maintainer: Damiano Fantini
description: Cancer cells accumulate DNA mutations as result of DNA damage and DNA
  repair processes. This computational framework is aimed at deciphering DNA mutational
  signatures operating in cancer. The input is a numeric matrix of DNA mutation counts
  detected in a panel of cancer samples. The framework performs Non-negative Matrix
  Factorization to extract the most likely signatures explaining the observed set
  of DNA mutations. The framework relies on parallelization and is optimized for use
  on multi-core systems. This framework is an R-based implementation of the original
  MATLAB WTSI framework by Alexandrov LB et al (2013) <DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.008>.
