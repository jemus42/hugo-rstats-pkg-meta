  'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'simdjson' Header-Only Library for
  'JSON' Parsing
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The 'JSON' format is ubiquitous for data interchange, and the
  'simdjson' library written by Daniel Lemire (and many contributors) provides
  a high-performance parser for these files which by relying on parallel 'SIMD'
  instruction manages to parse these files as faster than disk speed. See the
  <arXiv:1902.08318> paper for more details about 'simdjson'.  This package is
  at present only a very thin and incomplete wrapper and does not aim to replace
  the existing and excellent 'JSON' packages for R. But it does already validate
  orders of magnitude faster.
