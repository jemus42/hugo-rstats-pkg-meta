title: Utilities for Working with NEON Data
maintainer: Claire Lunch
description: |-
  NEON data packages can be accessed through the NEON Data Portal <https://data.neonscience.org/home>
  or through the NEON Data API (see <https://data.neonscience.org/data-api> for documentation). Data delivered from
  the Data Portal are provided as monthly zip files packaged within a parent zip file, while individual files
  can be accessed from the API. This package provides tools that aid in discovering, downloading, and reformatting
  data prior to use in analyses. This includes downloading data via the API, merging data tables by type, and
  converting formats. For more information, see the readme file at <https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities>.
