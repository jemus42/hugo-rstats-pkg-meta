title: Censored Spatial Models
maintainer: Alejandro Ordonez
description: It fits linear regression models for censored spatial data. It provides
  different estimation methods as the SAEM (Stochastic Approximation of Expectation
  Maximization) algorithm and seminaive that uses Kriging prediction to estimate the
  response at censored locations and predict new values at unknown locations. It also
  offers graphical tools for assessing the fitted model. More details can be found
  in Ordonez et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2017.12.001>.
