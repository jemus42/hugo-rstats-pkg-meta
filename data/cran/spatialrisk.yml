description: |-
  Methods for spatial risk calculations. It offers an efficient approach to determine the sum of all observations within a
  circle of a certain radius. This might be beneficial for insurers who are required (by a recent European Commission regulation) to determine
  the maximum value of insured fire risk policies of all buildings that are partly or fully located within a circle of a radius of 200m.
