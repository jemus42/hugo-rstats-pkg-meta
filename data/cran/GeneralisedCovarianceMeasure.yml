  Test for Conditional Independence Based on the Generalized
  Covariance Measure (GCM)
maintainer: Jonas Peters
description: A statistical hypothesis test for conditional independence. It performs
  nonlinear regressions on the conditioning variable and then tests for a vanishing
  covariance between the resulting residuals. It can be applied to both univariate
  random variables and multivariate random vectors. Details of the method can be found
  in Rajen D. Shah and Jonas Peters (2018) <arXiv:1804.07203>.
