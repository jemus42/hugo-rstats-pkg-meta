title: Density Tracking by Quadrature
maintainer: Harish S. Bhat
description: Implementation of density tracking by quadrature (DTQ) algorithms for
  stochastic differential equations (SDEs).  DTQ algorithms numerically compute the
  density function of the solution of an SDE with user-specified drift and diffusion
  functions.  The calculation does not require generation of sample paths, but instead
  proceeds in a deterministic fashion by repeatedly applying quadrature to the Chapman-Kolmogorov
  equation associated with a discrete-time approximation of the SDE.  The DTQ algorithm
  is provably convergent.  For several practical problems of interest, we have found
  the DTQ algorithm to be fast, accurate, and easy to use.
