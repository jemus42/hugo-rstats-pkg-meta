title: Visualization of Subgroups for Decision Trees
maintainer: Ashwini Venkatasubramaniam
description: Provides a visualization for characterizing subgroups defined by a decision
  tree structure. The visualization simplifies the ability to interpret individual
  pathways to subgroups; each sub-plot describes the distribution of observations
  within individual terminal nodes and percentile ranges for the associated inner
  nodes.
