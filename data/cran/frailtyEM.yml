version: 1.0.1
title: Fitting Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm
maintainer: Theodor Adrian Balan
description: |-
  Contains functions for fitting shared frailty models with a semi-parametric
  baseline hazard with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Supported data formats
  include clustered failures with left truncation and recurrent events in gap-time
  or Andersen-Gill format. Several frailty distributions, such as the the gamma, positive stable
  and the Power Variance Family are supported.
