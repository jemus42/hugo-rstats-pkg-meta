description: An efficient tool designed for differential analysis of large-scale RNA
  sequencing (RNAseq) data and Bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) data in the presence of
  individual relatedness and population structure. 'PQLseq' first fits a Generalized
  Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with adjusted covariates, predictor of interest and random
  effects to account for population structure and individual relatedness, and then
  performs Wald tests for each gene in RNAseq or site in BSseq.
