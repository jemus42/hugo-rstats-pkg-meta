  Modelling Dependence with Multivariate Archimax (or any
  User-Defined Continuous) Copulas
maintainer: Tomas Bacigal
description: Archimax copulas are mixture of Archimedean and EV copulas. The package
  provides definitions of several parametric families of generator and dependence
  function, computes CDF and PDF, estimates parameters, tests for goodness of fit,
  generates random sample and checks copula properties for custom constructs. In 2-dimensional
  case explicit formulas for density are used, in the contrary to higher dimensions
  when all derivatives are linearly approximated. Several non-archimax families (normal,
  FGM, Plackett) are provided as well.
