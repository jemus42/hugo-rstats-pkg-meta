title: Surrogate Residuals for Ordinal and General Regression Models
maintainer: Brandon Greenwell
description: |-
  An implementation of the surrogate approach to residuals and
  diagnostics for ordinal and general regression models; for details, see Liu
  and Zhang (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915>. These residuals can be
  used to construct standard residual plots for model diagnostics (e.g.,
  residual-vs-fitted value plots, residual-vs-covariate plots, Q-Q plots, etc.).
  The package also provides an 'autoplot' function for producing standard
  diagnostic plots using 'ggplot2' graphics. The package currently supports
  cumulative link models from packages 'MASS', 'ordinal', 'rms', and 'VGAM'.
  Support for binary regression models using the standard 'glm' function is also
  available.
