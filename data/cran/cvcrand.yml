  Constrained randomization by Raab and Butcher (2001) <doi:10.1002/1097-0258(20010215)20:3%3C351::AID-SIM797%3E3.0.CO;2-C>
  is suitable for cluster randomized trials (CRTs) with a
  small number of clusters (e.g., 20 or fewer). The procedure of
  constrained randomization is based on the baseline values of some
  cluster-level covariates specified. The intervention effect on
  the individual outcome can then be analyzed through
  clustered permutation test introduced by Gail, et al. (1996) <doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960615)15:11%3C1069::AID-SIM220%3E3.0.CO;2-Q>.
  Motivated from Li, et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.7410>, the package performs constrained randomization on the baseline
  values of cluster-level covariates and clustered permutation test on the individual-level outcomes for cluster randomized trials.
