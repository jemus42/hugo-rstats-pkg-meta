title: Sparse Reluctant Interaction Modeling
maintainer: Guo Yu
description: An implementation of a computationally efficient method to fit large-scale
  interaction models based on the reluctant interaction selection principle. The method
  and its properties are described in greater depth in Yu, G., Bien, J., and Tibshirani,
  R.J. (2019) "Reluctant interaction modeling", which is available at <arXiv:1907.08414>.
