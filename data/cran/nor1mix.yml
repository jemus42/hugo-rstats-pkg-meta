  Methods)
maintainer: Martin Maechler
description: |-
  Onedimensional Normal (i.e. Gaussian) Mixture Models Classes,
  for, e.g., density estimation or clustering algorithms research and teaching;
  providing the widely used Marron-Wand densities.  Efficient random
  number generation and graphics. Fitting to data by efficient ML (Maximum
  Likelihood) or traditional EM estimation.
