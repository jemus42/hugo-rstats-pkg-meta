title: Alignment of Phonetic Sequences Using the 'ALINE' Algorithm
maintainer: Sean Downey
description: |-
  Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance between words as per
  (Kondrak 2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox, Norquest, & Lansing, 2008,
  <doi:10.1080/09296170802326681>). The score is based on phonetic features represented
  using the Unicode-compliant International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized
  features weights are used to determine the optimal alignment and functions are
  provided to estimate optimum values using a genetic algorithm and supervised
  learning. See (Downey, Sun, and Norquest 2017,
