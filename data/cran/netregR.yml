title: Regression of Network Responses
maintainer: Frank W. Marrs
description: Regress network responses (both directed and undirected) onto covariates
  of interest that may be actor-, relation-, or network-valued. In addition, compute
  principled variance estimates of the coefficients assuming that the errors are jointly
  exchangeable. Missing data is accommodated. Additionally implements building and
  inversion of covariance matrices under joint exchangeability, and  generates random
  covariance matrices from this class. For more detail on methods, see Marrs, Fosdick,
  and McCormick (2017) <arXiv:1701.05530>.
