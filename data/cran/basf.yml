version: 0.1.0
title: Plot Simple Features with 'base' Sensibilities
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Resurrects the standard plot for shapes established by the
  'base' and 'graphics' packages. This is suited to workflows that require
  plotting using the established and traditional idioms of plotting spatially
  coincident data where it belongs. This package depends on 'sf' and only replaces
  the plot method.
