title: Non-Negative Conjugate-Gradient Minimizer
maintainer: David Cortes
description: |-
  Minimize a differentiable function subject to all the variables being non-negative (i.e. >= 0),
  using a Conjugate-Gradient algorithm based on a modified Polak-Ribiere-Polyak formula as described in
  (Li, Can, 2013, <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jam/2013/986317/abs/>).
