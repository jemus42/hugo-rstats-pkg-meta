title: Assessing Pst Statistics
maintainer: Blondeau Da Silva Stephane
description: Calculating Pst values to assess differentiation among populations from
  a set of quantitative traits is the primary purpose of such a package. The bootstrap
  method provides confidence intervals and distribution histograms of Pst. Variations
  of Pst in function of the parameter c/h^2 are studied as well. Finally, the package
  proposes different transformations especially to eliminate any variation resulting
  from allometric growth (calculation of residuals from linear regressions, Reist
  standardizations or Aitchison transformation).
