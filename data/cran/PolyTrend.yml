title: Trend Classification Algorithm
maintainer: Hristo Tomov
description: This algorithm classifies the trends into linear, quadratic, cubic, concealed
  and no-trend types. The "concealed trends" are those trends that possess quadratic
  or cubic forms, but the net change from the start of the time period to the end
  of the time period hasn't been significant. The "no-trend" category includes simple
  linear trends with statistically in-significant slope coefficient.
