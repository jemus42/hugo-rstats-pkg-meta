  Aides in the multi objective decision analysis process by simplifying
  the creation of value hierarchy tree plots, calculating and plotting single and
  multi attribute value function scores, and conducting sensitivity analysis. Linear,
  exponential, and categorical single attribute value functions are supported. For
  details see Parnell (2013, ISBN:978-1-118-17313-8) Kirkwood (1997, ISBN:0-534-51692-0).
