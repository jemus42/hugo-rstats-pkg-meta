title: Solving Complex Game Problems using Gaussian Processes
maintainer: Victor Picheny
description: Sequential strategies for finding a game equilibrium are proposed in
  a black-box setting (expensive pay-off evaluations, no derivatives). The algorithm
  handles noiseless or noisy evaluations. Two acquisition functions are available.
  Graphical outputs can be generated automatically.
