title: Multiresolution time warping for functional data.
maintainer: Gerda Claeskens
description: The Bayesian procedure starts with one warplet in the model and uses
  the posterior distributions as priors for a more extended model with one more warplet.
  The model is built with adding one warplet at a time and allows for amplitude variations.
