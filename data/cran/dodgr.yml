title: Distances on Directed Graphs
maintainer: Mark Padgham
description: |-
  Distances on dual-weighted directed graphs using priority-queue
  shortest paths (Padgham (2019) <doi:10.32866/6945>). Weighted directed
  graphs have weights from A to B which may differ from those from B to A.
  Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets of such weights. A canonical
  example is a street network to be used for routing in which routes are
  calculated by weighting distances according to the type of way and mode of
  transport, yet lengths of routes must be calculated from direct distances.
