title: Elegant Data Manipulation with Lenses
maintainer: Chris Hammill
description: Provides tools for creating and using lenses to simplify data manipulation.
  Lenses are composable getter/setter pairs for working with data in a purely functional
  way. Inspired by the 'Haskell' library 'lens' (Kmett, 2012) <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens>.
  For a fairly comprehensive (and highly technical) history of lenses please see the
  'lens' wiki <https://github.com/ekmett/lens/wiki/History-of-Lenses>.
