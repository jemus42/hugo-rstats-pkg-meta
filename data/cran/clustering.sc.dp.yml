  Optimal Distance-Based Clustering for Multidimensional Data with
  Sequential Constraint
maintainer: Tibor Szkaliczki
description: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal clustering multidimensional
  data with sequential constraint. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of within-cluster
  distances. The sequential constraint allows only subsequent items of the input data
  to form a cluster. The sequential constraint is typically required in clustering
  data streams or items with time stamps such as video frames, GPS signals of a vehicle,
  movement data of a person, e-pen data, etc. The algorithm represents an extension
  of Ckmeans.1d.dp to multiple dimensional spaces. Similarly to the one-dimensional
  case, the algorithm guarantees optimality and repeatability of clustering. Method
  clustering.sc.dp can find the optimal clustering if the number of clusters is known.
  Otherwise, methods findwithinss.sc.dp and backtracking.sc.dp can be used.
