  Tools for Mapping of Quantitative Traits of Genetically Related
  Individuals and Calculating Identity Coefficients from
  Pedigrees
maintainer: Riyan Cheng
description: This software provides tools for quantitative trait mapping in populations
  such as advanced intercross lines where relatedness among individuals should not
  be ignored. It can estimate background genetic variance components, impute missing
  genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for putative quantitative trait
  loci (QTL), and plot mapping results. It also has functions to calculate identity
  coefficients from pedigrees, especially suitable for pedigrees that consist of a
  large number of generations, or estimate identity coefficients from genotypic data
  in certain circumstances.
