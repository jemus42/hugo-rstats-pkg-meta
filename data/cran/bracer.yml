title: Brace Expansions
maintainer: Trevor Davis
description: Performs brace expansions on strings.  Made popular by Unix shells, brace
  expansion allows users to concisely generate certain character vectors by taking
  a single string and (recursively) expanding the comma-separated lists and double-period-separated
  integer and character sequences enclosed within braces in that string.  The double-period-separated
  numeric integer expansion also supports padding the resulting numbers with zeros.
