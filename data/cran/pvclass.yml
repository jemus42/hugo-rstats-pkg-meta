title: P-Values for Classification
maintainer: Niki Zumbrunnen
description: |-
  Computes nonparametric p-values for the potential class
  memberships of new observations as well as cross-validated
  p-values for the training data. The p-values are based on
  permutation tests applied to an estimated Bayesian likelihood
  ratio, using a plug-in statistic for the Gaussian model, 'k
  nearest neighbors', 'weighted nearest neighbors' or
  'penalized logistic regression'.
  Additionally, it provides graphical displays and quantitative
  analyses of the p-values.
