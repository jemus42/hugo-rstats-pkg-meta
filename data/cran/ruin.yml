title: Simulation of Various Risk Processes
maintainer: Iegor Rudnytskyi
description: |-
  A (not yet exhaustive) collection of common models of risk
  processes in actuarial science, represented as formal S4 classes. Each class
  (risk model) has a simulator of its path, and a plotting function. Further,
  a Monte-Carlo estimator of a ruin probability for a finite time is
  implemented, using a parallel computation. Currently, the package extends
  two classical risk models Cramer-Lundberg and Sparre Andersen models by
  including capital injections, that are positive jumps (see Breuer L. and
  Badescu A.L. (2014) <doi:10.1080/03461238.2011.636969>). The intent of the
  package is to provide a user-friendly interface for ruin processes'
  simulators, as well as a solid and extensible structure for future
  extensions.
