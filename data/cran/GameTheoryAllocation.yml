title: Tools for Calculating Allocations in Game Theory
maintainer: Alejandro Saavedra-Nieves
description: 'Many situations can be modeled as game theoretic situations. Some procedures
  are included in this package to calculate the most important allocations rules in
  Game Theory: Shapley value, Owen value or nucleolus, among other. First, we must
  define as an argument the value of the unions of the envolved agents with the characteristic
  function.'
