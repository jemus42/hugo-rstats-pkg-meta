title: Reconstruct Animal Paths from Solar Geolocation Loggers Data
maintainer: Eldar Rakhimberdiev
description: |-
  Spatio-temporal locations of an animal are computed
  from annotated data with a hidden Markov  model via particle
  filter algorithm. The package is relatively robust to varying
  degrees of shading.
  The hidden Markov model is described in Movement Ecology (Rakhimberdiev et al., 2015) <doi:10.1186/s40462-015-0062-5>,
  general package description is in the Methods in Ecology and Evolution (Rakhimberdiev et al., 2017) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12765>
  and package accuracy assessed in the Journal of Avian Biology (Rakhimberdiev et al. 2016) <doi:10.1111/jav.00891>.
