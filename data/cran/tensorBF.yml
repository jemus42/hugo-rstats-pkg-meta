title: Bayesian Tensor Factorization
maintainer: Suleiman A Khan
description: Bayesian Tensor Factorization for decomposition of tensor data sets using
  the trilinear CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization, with automatic component selection.
  The complete data analysis pipeline is provided, including functions and recommendations
  for data normalization and model definition, as well as missing value prediction
  and model visualization. The method performs factorization for three-way tensor
  datasets and the inference is implemented with Gibbs sampling.
