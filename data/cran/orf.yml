maintainer: Gabriel Okasa
description: |-
  An implementation of the Ordered Forest estimator as developed
  in Lechner & Okasa (2019) <arXiv:1907.02436>. The Ordered Forest flexibly
  estimates the conditional probabilities of models with ordered categorical
  outcomes (so-called ordered choice models). Additionally to common machine
  learning algorithms the 'orf' package provides functions for estimating
  marginal effects as well as statistical inference thereof and thus provides
  similar output as in standard econometric models for ordered choice. The
  core forest algorithm relies on the fast C++ forest implementation from
  the 'ranger' package (Wright & Ziegler, 2017) <arXiv:1508.04409>.
