maintainer: Shan Ba
description: Generate the optimal Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) for computer experiments
  with quantitative factors and the optimal Sliced Latin Hypercube Designs (SLHDs)
  for computer experiments with both quantitative and qualitative factors. Details
  of the algorithm can be found in Ba, S., Brenneman, W. A. and Myers, W. R. (2015),
  "Optimal Sliced Latin Hypercube Designs," Technometrics. Important function in this
  package is "maximinSLHD".
