  A Modification of Fleiss' Kappa in case of Nominal and Ordinal
  Variables
maintainer: Daniele Giardiello
description: The kappa statistic implemented by Fleiss is a very popular index for
  assessing the reliability of agreement among multiple observers. It is used both
  in the psychological and in the psychiatric field. Other fields of application are
  typically medicine, biology and engineering. Unfortunately,the kappa statistic may
  behave inconsistently in case of strong agreement between raters, since this index
  assumes lower values than it would have been expected. We propose a modification
  kappa implemented by Fleiss in case of nominal and ordinal variables. Monte Carlo
  simulations are used both to testing statistical hypotheses and to calculating percentile
  bootstrap confidence intervals based on proposed statistic in case of nominal and
  ordinal data.
