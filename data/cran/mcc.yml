description: A number of biomedical problems involve performing many hypothesis tests,
  with an attendant need to apply stringent thresholds. Often the data take the form
  of a series of predictor vectors, each of which must be compared with a single response
  vector, perhaps with nuisance covariates. Parametric tests of association are often
  used, but can result in inaccurate type I error at the extreme thresholds, even
  for large sample sizes. Furthermore, standard two-sided testing can reduce power
  compared to the doubled p-value, due to asymmetry in the null distribution. Exact
  (permutation) testing approaches are attractive, but can be computationally intensive
  and cumbersome. MCC is an approximation to exact association testing of two vectors
  that is accurate and fast enough for standard use in high-throughput settings, and
  can easily provide standard two-sided or doubled p-values.
