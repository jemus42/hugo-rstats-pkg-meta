title: Parametric Simplex Method for Sparse Learning
maintainer: Zichong Li
description: Implements a unified framework of parametric simplex method for a variety
  of sparse learning problems (e.g., Dantzig selector (for linear regression), sparse
  quantile regression, sparse support vector machines, and compressive sensing) combined
  with efficient hyper-parameter selection strategies. The core algorithm is implemented
  in C++ with Eigen3 support for portable high performance linear algebra. For more
  details about parametric simplex method, see Haotian Pang (2017) <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6623-parametric-simplex-method-for-sparse-learning.pdf>.
