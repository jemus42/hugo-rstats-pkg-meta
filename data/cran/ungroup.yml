  Penalized Composite Link Model for Efficient Estimation of
  Smooth Distributions from Coarsely Binned Data

description: |-
  Versatile method for ungrouping histograms (binned count data)
  assuming that counts are Poisson distributed and that the underlying sequence
  on a fine grid to be estimated is smooth. The method is based on the composite
  link model and estimation is achieved by maximizing a penalized likelihood.
  Smooth detailed sequences of counts and rates are so estimated from the binned
  counts. Ungrouping binned data can be desirable for many reasons: Bins can be
  too coarse to allow for accurate analysis; comparisons can be hindered when
  different grouping approaches are used in different histograms; and the last
  interval is often wide and open-ended and, thus, covers a lot of information
  in the tail area. Age-at-death distributions grouped in age classes and
  abridged life tables are examples of binned data. Because of modest assumptions,
  the approach is suitable for many demographic and epidemiological applications.
