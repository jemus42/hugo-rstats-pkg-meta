description: |-
  A system for embedded scientific computing and reproducible research with R.
  The OpenCPU server exposes a simple but powerful HTTP api for RPC and data interchange
  with R. This provides a reliable and scalable foundation for statistical services or
  building R web applications. The OpenCPU server runs either as a single-user development
  server within the interactive R session, or as a multi-user Linux stack based on Apache2.
  The entire system is fully open source and permissively licensed. The OpenCPU website
  has detailed documentation and example apps.
