maintainer: Indrajeet Patil
description: |-
  Extension of 'ggplot2', 'ggstatsplot' creates
  graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots
  themselves. It is targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community
  to provide a one-line code to generate information-rich plots for
  statistical analysis of continuous (violin plots, scatterplots,
  histograms, dot plots, dot-and-whisker plots) or categorical (pie and
  bar charts) data. Currently, it supports only the most common types of
  statistical tests: parametric, nonparametric, robust, and bayesian
  versions of t-test/anova, correlation analyses, contingency table
  analysis, meta-analysis, and regression analyses.
