title: Genome-Wide Association Study with SNP-Set Methods
maintainer: Kosuke Hamazaki
description: 'By using ''RAINBOWR'' (Reliable Association INference By Optimizing
  Weights with R), users can test multiple SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
  simultaneously by kernel-based (SNP-set) methods. This package can also be applied
  to haplotype-based GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). Users can test not only
  additive effects but also dominance and epistatic effects. In detail, please check
  our paper on PLOS Computational Biology: Kosuke Hamazaki and Hiroyoshi Iwata (2020)
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007663>.'
