title: Power Analysis for AB Testing
maintainer: William Cha
description: |-
  Power analysis for AB testing. The calculations are based on the Welch's unequal variances t-test,
  which is generally preferred over the Student's t-test when sample sizes and variances of the two groups are
  unequal, which is frequently the case in AB testing. In such situations, the Student's t-test will give
  biased results due to using the pooled standard deviation, unlike the Welch's t-test.
