version: 0.6.0
title: Tidy Tools for 'Raster' Data
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Facilities to work with vector and raster data in efficient
  repeatable and systematic work flow. Missing functionality in existing packages
  is included here to allow extraction from raster data with 'simple features' and
  'Spatial' types and to make extraction consistent and straightforward. Extract cell
  numbers from raster data and  return the cells as a data frame
  rather than as lists of matrices or vectors. The functions here allow spatial data
  to be used without special handling for the format currently in use.
