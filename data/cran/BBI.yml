title: Benthic Biotic Indices Calculation from Composition Data
maintainer: Tristan Cordier
description: |-
  Set of functions to calculate Benthic Biotic Indices from
  composition data, obtained whether from morphotaxonomic inventories or
  sequencing data. Based on reference ecological weights publicly available for
  a set of commonly used marine biotic indices, such as AMBI (A Marine Biotic Index, Borja et al., 2000) <doi:10.1016/S0025-326X(00)00061-8>
  NSI (Norwegian Sensitivity Index) and ISI (Indicator Species Index) (Rygg 2013, <ISBN:978-82-577-6210-0>). It provides the ecological quality status of the samples based on each BBI as well as the normalized Ecological Quality Ratio.
