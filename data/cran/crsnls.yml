  Nonlinear Regression Parameters Estimation by 'CRS4HC' and
  'CRS4HCe'
maintainer: Tomáš Goryl
description: |-
  Functions for nonlinear regression parameters estimation by algorithms based on Controlled Random Search algorithm.
  Both functions (crs4hc(), crs4hce()) adapt current search strategy by four heuristics competition. In addition, crs4hce() improves adaptability by adaptive stopping condition.
