  Jack-Knife Support for Evolutionary Distinctiveness Indices I
  and W
maintainer: Daniel R. Miranda-Esquivel
description: |-
  These functions calculate the taxonomic measures presented in Miranda-Esquivel (2016).
  The package introduces Jack-knife resampling in evolutionary distinctiveness prioritization analysis,
  as a way to evaluate the support of the ranking in area prioritization, and the persistence of a given area
  in a conservation analysis.
  The algorithm is described in: Miranda-Esquivel, D (2016) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_11>.
