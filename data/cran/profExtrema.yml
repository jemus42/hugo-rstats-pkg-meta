title: Compute and Visualize Profile Extrema Functions
maintainer: Dario Azzimonti
description: Computes profile extrema functions for arbitrary functions. If the function
  is expensive-to-evaluate it computes profile extrema by emulating the function with
  a Gaussian process (using package 'DiceKriging'). In this case uncertainty quantification
  on the profile extrema can also be computed. The different plotting functions for
  profile extrema give the user a tool to better locate excursion sets.
