title: Read Data from Files Readable by 'gnumeric'
maintainer: Karoly Antal
description: |-
  Read data files readable by 'gnumeric' into 'R'. Can read
  whole sheet or a range, from several file formats, including
  the native format of 'gnumeric'. Reading is done by using
  'ssconvert' (a file converter utility included in the 'gnumeric'
  distribution <http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/>) to convert
  the requested part to CSV. From 'gnumeric' files (but not other
  formats) can list sheet names and sheet sizes or read all
  sheets.
