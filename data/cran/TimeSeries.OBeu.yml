title: Time Series Analysis 'OpenBudgets.eu'
maintainer: Kleanthis Koupidis
description: Estimate and return the needed parameters for visualizations designed
  for 'OpenBudgets.eu' <http://openbudgets.eu/> time series data. Calculate time series
  model and forecast parameters in budget time series data of municipalities across
  Europe, according to the 'OpenBudgets.eu' data model. There are functions for measuring
  deterministic and stochastic trend of the input time series data with 'ACF', 'PACF',
  'Phillips Perron' test, 'Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF)' test, 'Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin
  (KPSS)' test, 'Mann Kendall' test for monotonic trend and 'Cox and Stuart' trend
  test, decomposing with local regression models or 'stl' decomposition, fitting the
  appropriate 'arima' model and provide forecasts for the input 'OpenBudgets.eu' time
  series fiscal data. Also, can be used generally to extract visualization parameters
  convert them to 'JSON' format and use them as input in a different graphical interface.
