description: 'Tool for producing Pen''s parade graphs, useful for visualizing inequalities
  in income, wages or other variables, as proposed by Pen (1971, ISBN: 978-0140212594).
  Income or another economic variable is captured by the vertical axis, while the
  population is arranged in ascending order of income along the horizontal axis. Pen''s
  income parades provide an easy-to-interpret visualization of economic inequalities.'
