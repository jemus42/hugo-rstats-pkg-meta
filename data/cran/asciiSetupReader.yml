  Reads Fixed-Width ASCII Data Files (.txt or .dat) that Have
  Accompanying Setup Files (.sps or .sas)
maintainer: Jacob Kaplan
description: |-
  Lets you open a fixed-width ASCII file (.txt or
  .dat) that has an accompanying setup file (.sps or .sas). These file
  combinations are sometimes referred to as .txt+.sps, .txt+.sas,
  .dat+.sps, or .dat+.sas. This will only run in a txt-sps or txt-sas
  pair in which the setup file contains instructions to open that text
  file. It will NOT open other text files, .sav, .sas, or .por data
  files. Fixed-width ASCII files with setup files are common in older
  (pre-2000) government data.
