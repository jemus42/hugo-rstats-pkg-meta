title: Fast Specialized CSV File Loader
maintainer: Sergei Izrailev
description: |-
  Functions for loading large (10M+ lines) CSV
  and other delimited files, similar to read.csv, but typically faster and
  using less memory than the standard R loader. While not entirely general,
  it covers many common use cases when the types of columns in the CSV file
  are known in advance. In addition, the package provides a class 'int64',
  which represents 64-bit integers exactly when reading from a file. The
  latter is useful when working with 64-bit integer identifiers exported from
  databases. The CSV file loader supports common column types including
  'integer', 'double', 'string', and 'int64', leaving further type
  transformations  to the user.
