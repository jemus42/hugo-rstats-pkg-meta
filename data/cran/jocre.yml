title: Joint Confidence Regions
maintainer: Philip Pallmann
description: Computing and plotting joint confidence regions and intervals. Regions
  include classical ellipsoids, minimum-volume or minimum-length regions, and an empirical
  Bayes region. Intervals include the TOST procedure with ordinary or expanded intervals
  and a fixed-sequence procedure. Such regions and intervals are useful e.g., for
  the assessment of multi-parameter (bio-)equivalence. Joint confidence regions for
  the mean and variance of a normal distribution are available as well.
