maintainer: Teng Fei
description: Modifies the distance matrix obtained from data with batch effects, so
  as to improve the performance of sample pattern detection, such as clustering, dimension
  reduction, and construction of networks between subjects. The method has been published
  in Bioinformatics (Fei et al, 2018, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty117>). Also available
