title: Linear Mixed-Effects Models using 'Eigen' and S4
maintainer: Ben Bolker
description: |-
  Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.
  The models and their components are represented using S4 classes and
  methods.  The core computational algorithms are implemented using the
  'Eigen' C++ library for numerical linear algebra and 'RcppEigen' "glue".
