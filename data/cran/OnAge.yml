title: Test of Between-Group Differences in the Onset of Senescence
maintainer: Aur√©lie Siberchicot
description: |-
  Implementation of a likelihood ratio test of differential
  onset of senescence between two groups. Given two groups with
  measures of age and of an individual trait likely to be subjected to
  senescence (e.g. body mass), 'OnAge' provides an asymptotic p-value
  for the null hypothesis that senescence starts at the same age in
  both groups. The package implements the procedure used in
  Douhard et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/oik.04421>.
