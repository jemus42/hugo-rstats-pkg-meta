title: Mixed Neighbourhood Selection
maintainer: Ricardo Pio Monti
description: An implementation of the mixed neighbourhood selection (MNS) algorithm.
  The MNS algorithm can be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. In
  particular, the motivation behind this work was driven by the need to understand
  functional connectivity networks across multiple subjects. This package also contains
  an implementation of a novel algorithm through which to simulate multiple related
  precision matrices which exhibit properties frequently reported in neuroimaging
  analysis.
