title: Wrapper of Python Library 'shap'
maintainer: Szymon Maksymiuk
description: Provides SHAP explanations of machine learning models. In applied machine
  learning, there is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance between interpretability
  and accuracy. However, in field of the Interpretable Machine Learning, there are
  more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models. One of the best known method
  for local explanations is SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) introduced by Lundberg,
  S., et al., (2016) <arXiv:1705.07874> The SHAP method is used to calculate influences
  of variables on the particular observation. This method is based on Shapley values,
  a technique used in game theory. The R package 'shapper' is a port of the Python
  library 'shap'.
