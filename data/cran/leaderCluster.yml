title: Leader Clustering Algorithm
maintainer: Taylor B. Arnold
description: |-
  The leader clustering algorithm provides
  a means for clustering a set of data points. Unlike many other clustering
  algorithms it does not require the user to specify the number of clusters,
  but instead requires the approximate radius of a cluster as its primary
  tuning parameter. The package provides a fast implementation of this
  algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances (with special cases for p=1,2,
  and infinity) as well as for spatial data using the Haversine
  formula, which takes latitude/longitude pairs as inputs and clusters
  based on great circle distances.
