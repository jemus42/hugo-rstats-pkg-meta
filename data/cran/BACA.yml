maintainer: Vittorio Fortino
description: R-based graphical tool to concisely visualise and compare biological
  annotations queried from the DAVID web service. It provides R functions to perform
  enrichment analysis (via DAVID - http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) on several gene
  lists at once, and then visualizing all the results in one generated figure that
  allows R users to compare the annotations found for each list.
