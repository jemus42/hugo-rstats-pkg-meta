title: Meta-Analysis of Medians
maintainer: Sean McGrath
description: |-
  Implements several methods to meta-analyze studies that report the
  sample median of the outcome. When the primary studies are one-group
  studies, the methods of McGrath et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8013> can
  be applied to estimate the pooled median. In the two-group context, the
  methods of McGrath et al. (2020) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201900036> can be
  applied to estimate the pooled raw difference of medians across groups.
