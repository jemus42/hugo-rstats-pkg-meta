  Exploring Disease Similarity in Terms of Dysfunctional
  Regulatory Mechanisms
maintainer: Jing Yang
description: Elucidation of human disease similarities has emerged as an active research
  area, which is highly relevant to etiology, disease classification, and drug repositioning.
  This package was designed and implemented for identifying disease similarities.
  It contains five functions which are 'DCEA', 'DCpathway', 'DS', 'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot'.
  In 'DCEA' function, differentially co-expressed genes and differentially co-expressed
  links are extracted from disease vs. health samples. Then 'DCpathway' function assigns
  differential co-expression values of pathways to be the average differential co-expression
  value of their component genes. Then 'DS' employs partial correlation coefficient
  of pathways as the disease similarity for each disease pairs. And 'DS' contains
  a permutation process for evaluating the statistical significant of observed disease
  partial correlation coefficients. At last, 'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot' sort out
  shared differentially co-expressed genes and differentially co-expressed links with
  regulation information and visualize them.
