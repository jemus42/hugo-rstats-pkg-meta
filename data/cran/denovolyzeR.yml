title: Statistical Analyses of De Novo Genetic Variants
maintainer: James Ware
description: |-
  An integrated toolset for the analysis of de novo (sporadic)
  genetic sequence variants. denovolyzeR implements a mutational model that
  estimates the probability of a de novo genetic variant arising in each human
  gene, from which one can infer the expected number of de novo variants in a
  given population size. Observed variant frequencies can then be compared against
  expectation in a Poisson framework. denovolyzeR provides a suite of functions
  to implement these analyses for the interpretation of de novo variation in human
  disease.
