title: Bayesian Distribution Regression
maintainer: Emmanuel Tsyawo
description: Implements Bayesian Distribution Regression methods. This package contains
  functions for three estimators (non-asymptotic, semi-asymptotic and asymptotic)
  and related routines for Bayesian Distribution Regression in Huang and Tsyawo (2018)
  <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3048658> which is also the recommended reference to cite for this
  package. The functions can be grouped into three (3) categories. The first computes
  the logit likelihood function and posterior densities under uniform and normal priors.
  The second contains Independence and Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms as functions and the third category of functions are
  useful for semi-asymptotic and asymptotic Bayesian distribution regression inference.
