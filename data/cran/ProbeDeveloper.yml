title: Develop Hybridization Probes
maintainer: Junhui Li
description: This tool can develop hybridization probes for target sequences based
  on melting temperature value calculated by R package 'TmCalculator' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TmCalculator>
  and methods extended from Beliveau, B. J.,(2018) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1714530115>,
  and those hybridization probes can be used to capture specific target regions in
  fluorescence in situ hybridization and next generation sequence experiments.
