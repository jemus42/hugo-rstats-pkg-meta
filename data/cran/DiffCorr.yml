  Analyzing and Visualizing Differential Correlation Networks in
  Biological Data
maintainer: Atsushi Fukushima
description: |-
  A method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental
  conditions in correlation networks (e.g., gene co-expression networks),
  which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's
  correlation coefficient. This package includes functions to calculate
  correlation matrices for high-dimensional dataset and to test
  differential correlation, which means the changes in the correlation
  relationship among variables (e.g., genes and metabolites) between 2
  experimental conditions.
