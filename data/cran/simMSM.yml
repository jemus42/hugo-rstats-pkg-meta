title: Simulation of Event Histories for Multi-State Models
maintainer: Holger Reulen
description: Simulation of event histories with possibly non-linear baseline hazard
  rate functions, non-linear (time-varying) covariate effect functions, and dependencies
  on the past of the history. Random generation of event histories is performed using
  inversion sampling on the cumulative all-cause hazard rate functions.
