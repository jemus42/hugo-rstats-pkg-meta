title: Various Linear Mixed Model Analyses
maintainer: Jixiang Wu
description: 'This package offers three important components: (1) to construct a use-defined
  linear mixed model, (2) to employ one of linear mixed model approaches: minimum
  norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) (Rao, 1971) for variance component estimation
  and random effect prediction; and (3) to employ a jackknife resampling technique
  to conduct various statistical tests. In addition, this package provides the function
  for model or data evaluations.This R package offers fast computations for large
  data sets analyses for various irregular data structures.'
