title: Binning Variables to Use in Logistic Regression
maintainer: Sneha Tody
description: Fast binning of multiple variables using parallel processing. A summary
  of all the variables binned is generated which provides the information value, entropy,
  an indicator of whether the variable follows a monotonic trend or not, etc. It supports
  rebinning of variables to force a monotonic trend as well as manual binning based
  on pre specified cuts. The cut points of the bins are based on conditional inference
  trees as implemented in the partykit package. The conditional inference framework
  is described by Hothorn T, Hornik K, Zeileis A (2006) <doi:10.1198/106186006X133933>.
