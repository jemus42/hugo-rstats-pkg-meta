title: Abbreviate Strings to Short, Unique Identifiers
maintainer: Shaun Jackman
description: For each string in a set of strings, determine a unique tag that is a
  substring of fixed size k unique to that string, if it has one. If no such unique
  substring exists, the least frequent substring is used. If multiple unique substrings
  exist, the lexicographically smallest substring is used. This lexicographically
  smallest substring of size k is called the "UniqTag" of that string.
