title: Efficient Iterator for Permutations and Combinations
maintainer: Randy Lai
description: |-
  Iterator for generating permutations and combinations. They
  can be either drawn with or without replacement, or with distinct/ non-distinct
  items (multiset). The generated sequences are in lexicographical order
  (dictionary order). The algorithms to generate permutations and combinations are
  memory efficient. These iterative algorithms enable users to process all sequences
  without putting all results in the memory at the same time.
  The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster performance. Note: 'iterpc' is no longer
  being maintained. Users are recommended to switch to 'arrangements'.
