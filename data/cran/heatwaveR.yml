title: Detect Heatwaves and Cold-Spells
maintainer: Robert W. Schlegel
description: The different methods of defining and detecting extreme events, known
  as heatwaves or cold-spells in both air and water temperature data are encompassed
  within this package. These detection algorithms may be used on non-temperature data
  as well however, this is not catered for explicitly here as no use of this technique
  in the literature currently exists.
