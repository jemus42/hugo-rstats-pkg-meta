title: Monitor the Total and Peak RAM Used by an Expression or Function
maintainer: Thomas Quinn
description: |-
  When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is critically
  important. However, it is not always enough to just monitor the
  size of the objects created. So-called "copy-on-modify" behavior,
  characteristic of R, means that some expressions or functions may
  require an unexpectedly large amount of RAM overhead. For example,
  replacing a single value in a matrix duplicates that matrix in the
  back-end, making this task require twice as much RAM as that used
  by the matrix itself. This package makes it easy to monitor the total
  and peak RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and
  eliminate RAM hungry code.
