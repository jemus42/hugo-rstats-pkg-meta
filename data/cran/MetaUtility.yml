title: Utility Functions for Conducting and Interpreting Meta-Analyses
maintainer: Maya B. Mathur
description: |-
  Contains functions to estimate the proportion of effects stronger than a threshold
  of scientific importance (function prop_stronger), to nonparametrically characterize the distribution of effects in a meta-analysis (calib_ests, pct_pval),
  to make effect size conversions (r_to_d, r_to_z, z_to_r), to compute and format inference in a meta-analysis (format_CI, format_stat, tau_CI), to scrape results from
  existing meta-analyses for re-analysis (scrape_meta, parse_CI_string).
