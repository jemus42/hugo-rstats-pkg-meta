description: |-
  Inputs a directory of climate projection files and, for each,
  identifies and characterizes heat waves for specified study locations. The
  definition used to identify heat waves can be customized. Heat wave
  characterizations include several metrics of heat wave length, intensity,
  and timing in the year. The heat waves that are identified can be
  explored using a function to apply user-created functions across all
  generated heat wave files.This work was supported in part by grants from
  the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the
  National Science Foundation (1331399), and the Colorado State University
  Vice President for Research.
