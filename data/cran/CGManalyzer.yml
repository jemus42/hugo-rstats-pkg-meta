title: Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data Analyzer
maintainer: Xinzheng Dong
description: 'Contains all of the functions necessary for the complete analysis of
  a continuous glucose monitoring study and can be applied to data measured by various
  existing ''CGM'' devices such as ''FreeStyle Libre'', ''Glutalor'', ''Dexcom'' and
  ''Medtronic CGM''. It reads a series of data files, is able to convert various formats
  of time stamps, can deal with missing values, calculates both regular statistics
  and nonlinear statistics, and conducts group comparison. It also displays results
  in a concise format. Also contains two unique features new to ''CGM'' analysis:
  one is the implementation of strictly standard mean difference and the class of
  effect size; the other is the development of a new type of plot called antenna plot.
  It corresponds to ''Zhang XD''(2018)<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx826>''s article
  ''CGManalyzer: an R package for analyzing continuous glucose monitoring studies''.'
