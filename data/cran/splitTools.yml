title: Tools for Data Splitting
maintainer: Michael Mayer
description: |-
  Fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. Data
  sets can be partitioned into disjoint groups (e.g. into training,
  validation, and test) or into (repeated) k-folds for subsequent
  cross-validation. Besides basic splits, the package supports
  stratified, grouped as well as blocked splitting. Furthermore,
  cross-validation folds for time series data can be created. See e.g.
  Hastie et al. (2001) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7> for the basic
  background on data partitioning and cross-validation.
