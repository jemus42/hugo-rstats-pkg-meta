title: 'CUTOFF: A Spatio-temporal Imputation Method'
maintainer: Lingbing Feng
description: This package provides a set of tools for spatio-temporal imputation<U+000a>in
  R. It includes the implementation for then CUTOFF imputation method,<U+000a>a useful
  cross-validation function that can be used not only by the<U+000a>CUOTFF method
  but also by some other imputation  functions to help<U+000a>choosing an optimal
  value for relevant parameters, such as the number<U+000a>of k-nearest neighbors
  for the KNN imputation method, or the number of<U+000a>components for the SVD imputation
  method. It also contains tools for<U+000a>simulating data with missing values with
  respect to some specific<U+000a>missing pattern, for example, block missing. Some
  useful visualisation<U+000a>functions for imputation purposes are also provided
  in the package.
