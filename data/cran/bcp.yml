title: Bayesian Analysis of Change Point Problems
maintainer: Xiaofei Wang
description: |-
  Provides an implementation of the Barry and Hartigan (1993) product
  partition model for the normal errors change point problem using Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo. It also extends the methodology to regression models on a connected
  graph (Wang and Emerson, 2015); this allows estimation of change point models
  with multivariate responses. Parallel MCMC, previously available in bcp v.3.0.0,
  is currently not implemented.
