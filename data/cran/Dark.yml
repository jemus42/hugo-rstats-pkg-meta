title: The Analysis of Dark Adaptation Data
maintainer: Jeremiah MF Kelly
description: |-
  The recovery of visual sensitivity in a dark environment is known
  as dark adaptation. In a clinical or research setting the recovery is typically
  measured after a dazzling flash of light and can be described by the Mahroo,
  Lamb and Pugh (MLP) model of dark adaptation. The functions in this package take
  dark adaptation data and use nonlinear regression to find the parameters of the
  model that 'best' describe the data. They do this by firstly, generating rapid
  initial objective estimates of data adaptation parameters, then a multi-start
  algorithm is used to reduce the possibility of a local minimum. There is also a
  bootstrap method to calculate parameter confidence intervals. The functions rely
  upon a 'dark' list or object. This object is created as the first step in the
  workflow and parts of the object are updated as it is processed.
