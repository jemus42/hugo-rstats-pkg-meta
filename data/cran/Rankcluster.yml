title: Model-Based Clustering for Multivariate Partial Ranking Data
maintainer: Quentin Grimonprez
description: |-
  Implementation of a model-based clustering algorithm for
  ranking data (C. Biernacki, J. Jacques (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.008>).
  Multivariate rankings as well as partial rankings are taken
  into account. This algorithm is based on an extension of the Insertion
  Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data, which is a meaningful and
  effective model parametrized by a position parameter (the modal ranking,
  quoted by mu) and a dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The heterogeneity
  of the rank population is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas conditional
  independence assumption is considered for multivariate rankings.
