title: Discretization and Grouping for Logistic Regression
maintainer: Adrien Ehrhardt
description: A Stochastic-Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm (Celeux et al.
  (1995) <https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00074164>) associated with a Gibbs sampler which
  purpose is to learn a constrained representation for logistic regression that is
  called quantization (Ehrhardt et al. (2019) <arXiv:1903.08920>). Continuous features
  are discretized and categorical features' values are grouped to produce a better
  logistic regression model. Pairwise interactions between quantized features are
  dynamically added to the model through a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hastings,
  W. K. (1970) <doi:10.1093/biomet/57.1.97>).
