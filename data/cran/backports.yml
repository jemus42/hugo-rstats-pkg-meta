title: Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0
maintainer: Michel Lang
description: |2-

  Functions introduced or changed since R v3.0.0 are re-implemented in this
  package. The backports are conditionally exported in order to let R resolve
  the function name to either the implemented backport, or the respective base
  version, if available. Package developers can make use of new functions or
  arguments by selectively importing specific backports to
  support older installations.
