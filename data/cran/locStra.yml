version: '1.3'
title: Fast Implementation of (Local) Population Stratification Methods
maintainer: Georg Hahn
description: Fast and fully sparse 'cpp' implementations to compute the genetic covariance
  matrix, the genomic relationship matrix, the Jaccard matrix, and the s-matrix of
  an input matrix. Full support for sparse matrices from the R-package 'Matrix'. Additionally,
  a 'cpp' implementation of the power method (von Mises iteration) algorithm to compute
  the largest eigenvector of a matrix is included, and a function to compute sliding
  windows.
