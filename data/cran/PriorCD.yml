description: Prioritize candidate cancer drugs for drug repositioning based on the
  random walk with restart algorithm in a drug-drug functional similarity network.
  1) We firstly constructed a drug-drug functional similarity network by integrating
  pathway activity and drug activity derived from the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. 2)
  Secondly, we calculated drug repurposing score according to a set of approved therapeutic
  drugs of interested cancer based on the random walk with restart algorithm in the
  drug-drug functional similarity network. 3) Finally, the permutation test was used
  to calculate the statistical significance level for the drug repurposing score.
