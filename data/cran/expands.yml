title: Expanding Ploidy and Allele-Frequency on Nested Subpopulations
maintainer: Noemi Andor
description: 'Expanding Ploidy and Allele Frequency on Nested Subpopulations (expands)
  characterizes coexisting subpopulations in a single tumor sample using copy number
  and allele frequencies derived from exome- or whole genome sequencing input data
  (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24177718>). The model detects coexisting genotypes
  by leveraging run-specific tradeoffs between depth of coverage and breadth of coverage.
  This package predicts the number of clonal expansions, the size of the resulting
  subpopulations in the tumor bulk, the mutations specific to each subpopulation,
  tumor purity and phylogeny. The main function runExPANdS() provides the complete
  functionality needed to predict coexisting subpopulations from single nucleotide
  variations (SNVs) and associated copy numbers.  The robustness of subpopulation
  predictions increases with the number of mutations provided. It is recommended that
  at least 200 mutations are used as input to obtain stable results. Updates in version
  2.1 include: (i) new parameter ploidy in runExPANdS.R allows specification of non-diploid
  background ploidies (e.g. for near-triploid cell lines); (ii) parallel computing
  option is available. Further documentation and FAQ available at <http://dna-discovery.stanford.edu/software/expands>.'
