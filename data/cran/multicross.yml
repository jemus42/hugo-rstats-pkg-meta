  A Graph-Based Test for Comparing Multivariate Distributions in
  the Multi Sample Framework
maintainer: Divyansh Agarwal
description: 'We introduce a nonparametric, graphical test based on optimal matching
  for assessing whether multiple unknown multivariate probability distributions are
  equal. This method is consistent, and does not make any distributional assumptions
  on the data. Our procedure combines data that belong to different classes or groups
  to create a graph on the pooled data, and then utilizes the number of edges connecting
  data points from different classes to examine equality of distributions among the
  classes. The functions available through this package implement the work described
  here: <arXiv:1906.04776>.'
