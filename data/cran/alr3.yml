description: |-
  Data files and a few functions used in the textbook S. Weisberg (2005),
  'Applied Linear Regression,' 3rd edition, Wiley are presented.
  This package depends on the car package. Many functions formerly
  in alr3 have been renamed and now reside in car.
  Data files have been lightly modified to make some data columns row labels.  Many
  of these files are also in the newer alr4 package.
