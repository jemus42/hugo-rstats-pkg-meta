description: Simplify your portfolio optimization process by applying a contemporary
  modeling way to model and solve your portfolio problems. While most approaches and
  packages are rather complicated this one tries to simplify things and is agnostic
  regarding risk measures as well as optimization solvers. Some of the methods implemented
  are described by Konno and Yamazaki (1991) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.37.5.519>, Rockafellar
  and Uryasev (2001) <doi:10.21314/JOR.2000.038> and Markowitz (1952) <doi:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x>.
