description: |-
  A tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in
  different management scenarios (D'Andrea et al., 2020
  <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13394>). 'smartR' (Spatial Management and Assessment
  of demersal Resources for Trawl fisheries) combines information from different
  tasks gathered within the European Data Collection Framework for the fishery
  sector. The 'smartR' package implements the SMART model (Russo et al., 2014
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086222>), through the object-oriented
  programming paradigm, and within this package it is possible to achieve the
  complete set of analyses required by the SMART approach: from the editing and
  formatting of the raw data; the construction and maintenance of coherent
  datasets; the numerical and visual inspection of the generated metadata; to
  the final simulation of management scenarios and the forecast of their
  effects. The interaction between the user and the application could take
  place through invocation of methods via the command line or could be entirely
  committed to the graphical user interfaces (GUI).
