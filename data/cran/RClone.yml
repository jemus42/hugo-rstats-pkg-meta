title: Partially Clonal Populations Analysis
maintainer: Diane Bailleul
description: R version of 'GenClone' (a computer program to analyse genotypic data,
  test for clonality and describe spatial clonal organization, Arnaud-Haond & Belkhir
  2007, <http://wwz.ifremer.fr/clonix/content/download/68205/903914/file/GenClone2.0.setup.zip>),
  this package allows clone handling as 'GenClone' does, plus the possibility to work
  with several populations, MultiLocus Lineages (MLL) custom definition and use, and
  p-value calculation for psex statistic (probability of originating from distinct
  sexual events) and psex_Fis statistic (taking account of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
  departure) as 'MLGsim'/'MLGsim2' (a program for detecting clones using a simulation
  approach, Stenberg et al. 2003).
