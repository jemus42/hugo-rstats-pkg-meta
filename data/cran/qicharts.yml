maintainer: Jacob Anhoej
description: |-
  Functions for making run charts and basic Shewhart control
  charts for measure and count data.
  The main function, qic(), creates run and control charts and has a
  simple interface with a rich set of options to control data analysis
  and plotting, including options for automatic data aggregation by
  subgroups, easy analysis of before-and-after data, exclusion of one
  or more data points from analysis, and splitting charts into
  sequential time periods.
  Missing values and empty subgroups are handled gracefully.
