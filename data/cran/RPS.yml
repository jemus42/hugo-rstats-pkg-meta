maintainer: Guillermo Andres Pacheco
description: |-
  Based on RPS tools, a rather complete resistant shape
  analysis of 2D and 3D datasets based on landmarks can be performed. In addition,
  landmark-based resistant shape analysis of individual asymmetry in 2D for
  matching or object symmetric structures is also possible.
