maintainer: Milana Gataric
description: Implements the SPCAvRP algorithm, developed and analysed in "Sparse principal
  component analysis via random projections" Gataric, M., Wang, T. and Samworth, R.
  J. (2018) <arXiv:1712.05630>. The algorithm is based on the aggregation of eigenvector
  information from carefully-selected random projections of the sample covariance
  matrix.
