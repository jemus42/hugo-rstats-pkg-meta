title: Bayesian Tree Prior Simulation
maintainer: Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau
description: Provides a way to simulate from the prior distribution of Bayesian trees
  by Chipman et al. (1998) <DOI:10.2307/2669832>. The prior distribution of Bayesian
  trees is highly dependent on the design matrix X, therefore using the suggested
  hyperparameters by Chipman et al. (1998) <DOI:10.2307/2669832> is not recommended
  and could lead to unexpected prior distribution. This work is part of my master
  thesis (expected 2016).
