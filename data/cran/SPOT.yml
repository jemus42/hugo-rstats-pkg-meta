title: Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox
maintainer: Martin Zaefferer
description: |-
  A set of tools for model based optimization and tuning of
  algorithms. It includes surrogate models, optimizers and design of experiment
  approaches. The main interface is spot, which uses sequentially updated
  surrogate models for the purpose of efficient optimization. The main goal is
  to ease the burden of objective function evaluations, when a single evaluation
  requires a significant amount of resources.
