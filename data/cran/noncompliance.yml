  Causal Inference in the Presence of Treatment Noncompliance
  Under the Binary Instrumental Variable Model
maintainer: Wen Wei Loh
description: |-
  A finite-population significance test of the 'sharp' causal null hypothesis that
  treatment exposure X has no effect on final outcome Y, within the principal stratum of Compliers.
  A generalized likelihood ratio test statistic is used, and the resulting p-value is exact.
  Currently, it is assumed that there are only Compliers and Never Takers in the population.
