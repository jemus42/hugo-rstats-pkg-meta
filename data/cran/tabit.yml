title: Simple Tabulation Made Simple
maintainer: Peter Meissner
description: |-
  Simple tabulation should be dead simple.
  This package is an opinionated approach to easy tabulations while also
  providing exact numbers and allowing for re-usability.
  This is achieved by providing tabulations as data.frames with columns for
  values, optional variable names, frequency counts including and excluding
  NAs and percentages for counts including and excluding NAs. Also values are
  automatically sorted by in decreasing order of frequency counts to allow for
  fast skimming of the most important information.
