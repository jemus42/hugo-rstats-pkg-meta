title: Tunable Simulation of B- And T-Cell Receptor Repertoires
maintainer: Cédric R. Weber
description: |-
  Simulate full B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoires using an in silico
  recombination process that includes a wide variety of tunable parameters to introduce noise and biases.
  Additional post-simulation modification functions allow the user to implant motifs or codon biases as
  well as remodeling sequence similarity architecture. The output repertoires contain records of all
  relevant repertoire dimensions and can be analyzed using provided repertoire analysis functions.
  Preprint is available at bioRxiv (Weber et al., 2019 <doi:10.1101/759795>).
