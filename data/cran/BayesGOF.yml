title: Bayesian Modeling via Frequentist Goodness-of-Fit
maintainer: Doug Fletcher
description: 'A Bayesian data modeling scheme that performs four interconnected tasks:
  (i) characterizes the uncertainty of the elicited parametric prior; (ii) provides
  exploratory diagnostic for checking prior-data conflict; (iii) computes the final
  statistical prior density estimate; and (iv) executes macro- and micro-inference.
