title: Algorithms for Quantile- And Mean-Optimal Treatment Regimes
maintainer: Yu Zhou
description: Estimation methods for optimal treatment regimes under three different
  criteria, namely marginal quantile, marginal mean, and mean absolute difference.
  For the first two criteria, both one-stage and two-stage estimation method are implemented.
  A doubly robust estimator for estimating the quantile-optimal treatment regime is
  also included.
