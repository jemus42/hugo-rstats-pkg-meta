  Stochastic Simulation of Streamflow Time Series using Phase
  Randomization
maintainer: Manuela Brunner
description: |-
  Provides a simulation framework to simulate streamflow time series with similar
  main characteristics as observed data. These characteristics include the distribution of daily
  streamflow values and their temporal correlation as expressed by short- and long-range
  dependence. The approach is based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier
  transform or the phases of the wavelet transform. The function prsim() is applicable to single site simulation and uses the Fourier transform.
  The function prsim.wave() extends the approach to multiple sites and is based on the complex wavelet transform. We further use the flexible four-parameter Kappa distribution, which allows
  for the extrapolation to yet unobserved low and high flows. Alternatively, the empirical or any other distribution can be used. A detailed description of
  the simulation approach for single sites and an application example can be found
  in <https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2019-142/>.
