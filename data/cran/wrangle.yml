title: A Systematic Data Wrangling Idiom
maintainer: Tim Bergsma
description: |-
  Supports systematic scrutiny, modification, and integration of
  data. The function status() counts rows that have missing values in
  grouping columns (returned by na() ), have non-unique combinations of
  grouping columns (returned by dup() ), and that are not locally sorted
  (returned by unsorted() ). Functions enumerate() and itemize() give
  sorted unique combinations of columns, with or without occurrence counts,
  respectively. Function ignore() drops columns in x that are present in y,
  and informative() drops columns in x that are entirely NA; constant() returns
  values that are constant, given a key.  Data that have defined unique
  combinations of grouping values behave more predictably during merge operations.
