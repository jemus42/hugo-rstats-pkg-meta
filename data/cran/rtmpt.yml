title: Fitting RT-MPT Models
maintainer: Raphael Hartmann
description: |-
  Fit response-time extended multinomial processing tree (RT-MPT) models by Klauer and
  Kellen (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2017.12.003>. The RT-MPT class not only incorporate
  frequencies like traditional multinomial processing tree (MPT) models, but also latencies. This enables it
  to estimate process completion times and encoding plus motor execution times next to the process probabilities
  of traditional MPTs. 'rtmpt' is a Bayesian framework and posterior samples are sampled using a Metropolis-Gibbs
  sampler like the one described in the Klauer and Kellen (2018), but with some modifications. Other than in
  the original C++ program we use the free and open source GNU Scientific Library (GSL). There is also the
  possibility to suppress single process completion times.
