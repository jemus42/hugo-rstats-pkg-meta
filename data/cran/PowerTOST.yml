maintainer: Detlew Labes
description: |-
  Contains functions to calculate power and sample size for
  various study designs used in bioequivalence studies. Use known.designs() to
  see the designs supported. Power and sample size can be obtained based on
  different methods, amongst them prominently the TOST procedure (two one-sided t-tests).
  See README and NEWS for further information.
