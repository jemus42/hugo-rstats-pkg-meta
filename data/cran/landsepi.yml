description: |-
  A spatio-temporal stochastic model to assess resistance deployment strategies
  against plant pathogens. The model is based on stochastic geometry for describing the
  landscape and the resistant hosts, a dispersal kernel for the dissemination of the
  pathogen, and a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) architecture to simulate
  plant response to disease.
