  Bayesian Model Selection in Logistic Regression for the
  Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions
maintainer: Mohammed Sedki
description: Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting
  adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases
  requires statistical methods. We propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity
  is viewed as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings
  algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion.
