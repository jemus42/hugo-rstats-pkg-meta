description: |-
  Estimate gender from names in Spanish and Portuguese.
  Works with vectors and dataframes. The estimation works not only
  for first names but also full names. The package relies on a
  compilation of common names with it's most frequent associated
  gender in both languages which are used as look up tables for gender
  inference.
