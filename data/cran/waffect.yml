  A package to simulate constrained phenotypes under a disease
  model H1
maintainer: G. Nuel
description: |-
  waffect (pronounced 'double-u affect' for 'weighted
  affectation') is a package to simulate phenotypic (case or
  control) datasets under a disease model H1 such that the total
  number of cases is constant across all the simulations (the
  constrain in the title). The package also makes it possible to
  generate phenotypes in the case of more than two classes, so
  that the number of phenotypes belonging to each class is
  constant across all the simulations. waffect is used to assess
  empirically the statistical power of Genome Wide Association
  studies.
