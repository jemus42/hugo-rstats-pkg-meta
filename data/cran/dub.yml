title: Unpacking Assignment for Lists via Pattern Matching
maintainer: Eugene Ha
description: |-
  Provides an operator for assigning nested components of a list to
  names via a concise pattern matching syntax. This is especially convenient for
  assigning individual names to the multiple values that a function may return
  in the form of a list, and for extracting deeply nested list components.
