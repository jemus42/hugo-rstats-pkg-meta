version: 0.2.3
title: Quick and Dirty Estimates for Wildlife Populations
maintainer: Mike Meredith
description: Provides simple, fast functions for maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates
  of wildlife population parameters, suitable for use with simulated data or bootstraps.
  Early versions were indeed quick and dirty, but optional error-checking routines
  and meaningful error messages have been added. Includes single and multi-season
  occupancy, closed capture population estimation, survival, species richness and
  distance measures.
