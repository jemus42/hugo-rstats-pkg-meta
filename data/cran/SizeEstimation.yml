maintainer: Kyongwon Kim<kbk5206@psu.edu>
description: This function develops an algorithm for presenting a Bayesian hierarchical
  model for estimating the sizes of local and national drug injected populations in
  Bangladesh. The model incorporates multiple commonly used data sources including
  mapping data, surveys, interventions, capture-recapture data, estimates or guesstimates
  from organizations, and expert opinion.
