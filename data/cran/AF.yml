  Model-Based Estimation of Confounder-Adjusted Attributable
  Fractions
maintainer: Elisabeth Dahlqwist
description: |-
  Estimates the attributable fraction in different sampling designs
  adjusted for measured confounders using logistic regression (cross-sectional
  and case-control designs), conditional logistic regression (matched case-control
  design), Cox proportional hazard regression (cohort design with time-to-
  event outcome), gamma-frailty model with a Weibull baseline hazard and instrumental variables analysis.
  An exploration of the AF with a genetic exposure can be found in the package 'AFheritability' Dahlqwist E et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s00439-019-02006-8>.
