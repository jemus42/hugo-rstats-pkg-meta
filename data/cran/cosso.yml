title: Fit Regularized Nonparametric Regression Models Using COSSO<U+000a>Penalty.
maintainer: Chen-Yen Lin
description: COSSO is a new regularization method that automatically<U+000a>estimates
  and selects important function components by a<U+000a>soft-thresholding penalty
  in the context of smoothing spline<U+000a>ANOVA models. Implemented models include
  mean regression,<U+000a>quantile regression, logistic regression and the Cox regression<U+000a>models.
