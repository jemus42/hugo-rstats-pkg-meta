  Trajectory Miner: a Toolbox for Exploring and Rendering
  Sequences
maintainer: Gilbert Ritschard
description: Toolbox for the manipulation, description and rendering of sequences,
  and more generally the mining of sequence data in the field of social sciences.
  Although the toolbox is primarily intended for analyzing state or event sequences
  that describe life courses such as family formation histories or professional careers,
  its features also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. It accepts
  many different sequence representations as input and provides tools for converting
  sequences from one format to another. It offers several functions for describing
  and rendering sequences, for computing distances between sequences with different
  metrics (among which optimal matching), original dissimilarity-based analysis tools,
  and simple functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and identifying
  the most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be found on the TraMineR
  web page.
