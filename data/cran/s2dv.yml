title: A Set of Common Tools for Seasonal to Decadal Verification
maintainer: An-Chi Ho
description: |-
  The advanced version of package 's2dverification', which the details can
  be found in Manubens et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.01.018>.
  It is intended for 'seasonal to decadal' (s2d) climate forecast verification, but
  it can also be used in other kinds of forecasts or general climate analysis.
  This package is specially designed for the comparison between the experimental
  and observational datasets. The functionality of the included functions covers
  from data retrieval, data post-processing, skill scores against observation,
  to visualization. Compared to 's2dverification', 's2dv' is more compatible
  with the package 'startR', able to use multiple cores for computation and
  handle multi-dimensional arrays with a higher flexibility.
