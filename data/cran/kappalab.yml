title: Non-Additive Measure and Integral Manipulation Functions
maintainer: Ivan Kojadinovic
description: 'S4 tool box for capacity (or non-additive measure, fuzzy measure) and
  integral manipulation in a finite setting. It contains routines for handling various
  types of set functions such as games or capacities. It can be used to compute several
  non-additive integrals: the Choquet integral, the Sugeno integral, and the symmetric
  and asymmetric Choquet integrals. An analysis of capacities in terms of decision
  behavior can be performed through the computation of various indices such as the
  Shapley value, the interaction index, the orness degree, etc. The well-known MÃ¶bius
  transform, as well as other equivalent representations of set functions can also
  be computed. Kappalab further contains seven capacity identification routines: three
  least squares based approaches, a method based on linear programming, a maximum
  entropy like method based on variance minimization, a minimum distance approach
  and an unsupervised approach based on parametric entropies. The functions contained
  in Kappalab can for instance be used in the framework of multicriteria decision
  making or cooperative game theory.'
