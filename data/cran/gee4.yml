  Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE/WGEE) using 'Armadillo'
  and S4
maintainer: Yi Pan
description: |-
  Fit joint mean-covariance models for longitudinal data within the
  framework of (weighted) generalised estimating equations (GEE/WGEE). The
  models and their components are represented using S4 classes and methods.
  The core computational algorithms are implemented using the 'Armadillo' C++
  library for numerical linear algebra and 'RcppArmadillo' glue.
