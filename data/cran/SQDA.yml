title: Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
maintainer: Jiehuan Sun
description: Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (SQDA) can be performed. In SQDA,
  the covariance matrix are assumed to be block-diagonal.And, for each block, sparsity
  assumption is imposed on the covariance matrix. It is useful in high-dimensional
  setting.
