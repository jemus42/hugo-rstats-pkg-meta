title: Transformation Models with Mixed Effects
maintainer: Balint Tamasi
description: |-
  Likelihood-based estimation of mixed-effects transformation models using the Template
  Model Builder (TMB). The technical details of transformation models are given in Hothorn et al. (2018)
  <doi:10.1111/sjos.12291>. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed on the scale of the
  transformation function, the marginal likelihood is evaluated using the Laplace approximation,
  and the gradients are calculated with automatic differentiation (AD).
