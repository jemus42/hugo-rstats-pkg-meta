maintainer: Sizhong Yang
description: Summarizes the taxonomic composition, diversity contribution of the rare
  and abundant community by using OTU (operational taxonomic unit) table which was
  generated by analyzing pipeline of 'QIIME' or 'mothur'. The rare biosphere in this
  package is subset by the relative abundance threshold (for details about rare biosphere
  please see Lynch and Neufeld (2015) <doi:10.1038/nrmicro3400>).
