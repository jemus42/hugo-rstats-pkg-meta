title: LaTeX descriptive statistic reporting for survey data
maintainer: Dustin Landers
description: suRtex was designed for easy descriptive statistic reporting of categorical
  survey data (e.g., Likert scales) in LaTeX. suRtex takes a matrix or data frame
  and produces the LaTeX code necessary for a sideways table creation. Mean, median,
  standard deviation, and sample size are optional.
