  Candidate Gene Prioritization for Non-Communicable Diseases
  Based on Functional Information
maintainer: Erqiang Hu
description: |-
  In gene sequencing methods, the topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are
  often used, such as ToppNet <https://toppgene.cchmc.org>. In this study, a candidate gene prioritization method
  was proposed for non-communicable diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes in weighted disease
  PPI networks with weights for nodes and edges based on functional information.
