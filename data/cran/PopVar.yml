  Genomic Breeding Tools: Genetic Variance Prediction and
  Cross-Validation
maintainer: Tyler Tiede
description: The main attribute of 'PopVar' is the prediction of genetic variance
  in bi-parental populations, from which the package derives its name. 'PopVar' contains
  a set of functions that use phenotypic and genotypic data from a set of candidate
  parents to 1) predict the mean, genetic variance, and superior progeny value of
  all, or a defined set of pairwise bi-parental crosses, and 2) perform cross-validation
  to estimate genome-wide prediction accuracy of multiple statistical models. More
  details are available in Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015). Crop Sci. doi:10.2135/cropsci2015.01.0030.
  A dataset 'think_barley.rda' is included for reference and examples.
