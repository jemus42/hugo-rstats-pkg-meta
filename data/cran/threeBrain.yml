description: |-
  In neuroscience, 'AFNI/SUMA' is a great tool to visualize 3D brain.
  However, it takes efforts to interact and share the viewer to others. In
  addition, 'AFNI/SUMA' doesn't support Windows platform. In the 'EEG/iEEG'
  field, it's hard to have multiple cortical electrodes mapped to a template
  brain for group analysis. Therefore this package is written aimed at
  providing a fast, stable, interactive and easy to share tool based on 'Three.js',
  a 'WebGL' engine to render 3D objects in the web browser such that we can
  display brain surfaces on webpage interactively. This package translates R
  objects to JavaScript objects via 'JSON' format, and provides 'R-Shiny' interface
  to manipulate geometries interactively. The visualizations can also serve as
  standalone widgets that can be easily shared across different platforms.
  Along with 'rave', another package developed by Beauchamp's lab at Baylor
  College Medicine, this package provides solutions to easily map surface
  electrodes from multiple subjects to one template 141 brain.
