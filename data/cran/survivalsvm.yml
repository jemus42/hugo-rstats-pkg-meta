title: Survival Support Vector Analysis
maintainer: Cesaire Fouodo
description: |-
  Performs support vectors analysis for data sets with survival
  outcome. Three approaches are available in the package: The regression approach
  takes censoring into account when formulating the inequality constraints of
  the support vector problem. In the ranking approach, the inequality constraints
  set the objective to maximize the concordance index for comparable pairs
  of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking
  constraints in the same model.
