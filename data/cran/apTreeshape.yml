title: Analyses of Phylogenetic Treeshape
maintainer: Michael Blum
description: |-
  Simulation and analysis
  of phylogenetic tree topologies using statistical indices. It
  is a companion library of the 'ape' package. It provides
  additional functions for reading, plotting, manipulating
  phylogenetic trees. It also offers convenient web-access to
  public databases, and enables testing null models of
  macroevolution using corrected test statistics.  Trees of class
  "phylo" (from 'ape' package) can be converted easily.
  Implements methods described in Bortolussi et al. (2005)
  <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti798> and Maliet et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1101/224295>.
