  Bayesian Clustering of Multivariate Data Under the
  Dirichlet-Process Prior
maintainer: Audrey Q. Fu
description: A Bayesian clustering method for replicated time series or replicated
  measurements from multiple experimental conditions, e.g., time-course gene expression
  data.  It estimates the number of clusters directly from the data using a Dirichlet-process
  prior.  See Fu, A. Q., Russell, S., Bray, S. and Tavare, S. (2013) Bayesian clustering
  of replicated time-course gene expression data with weak signals. The Annals of
  Applied Statistics. 7(3) 1334-1361. <doi:10.1214/13-AOAS650>.
