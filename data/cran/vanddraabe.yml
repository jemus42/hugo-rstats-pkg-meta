  Identification and Statistical Analysis of Conserved Waters Near
  Proteins
maintainer: Emilio Xavier Esposito
description: |-
  Identify and analyze conserved waters within crystallographic
  protein structures and molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. Statistical
  parameters for each water cluster, informative graphs, and a PyMOL session
  file to visually explore the conserved waters and protein are returned.
  Hydrophilicity is the propensity of waters to congregate near specific protein
  atoms and is related to conserved waters. An informatics derived set of
  hydrophilicity values are provided based on a large, high-quality X-ray
  protein structure dataset.
