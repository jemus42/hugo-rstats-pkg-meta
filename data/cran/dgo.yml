title: Dynamic Estimation of Group-Level Opinion
maintainer: James Dunham
description: |-
  Fit dynamic group-level item response theory (IRT) and multilevel
  regression and poststratification (MRP) models from item response data. dgo
  models latent traits at the level of demographic and geographic groups,
  rather than individuals, in a Bayesian group-level IRT approach developed by
  Caughey and Warshaw (2015) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpu021>. The package also
  estimates subpopulations' average responses to single survey items with a
  dynamic MRP model proposed by Park, Gelman, and Bafumi (2004)
  <doi:10.11126/stanford/9780804753005.003.0011>.
