title: Calculate the Compressibility Factor 'z' for Hydrocarbon Gases
maintainer: Alfonso R. Reyes
description: |-
  Computational algorithms to solve equations and find the
  'compressibility' factor `z` of hydrocarbon gases. Correlations available:
  'Hall-Yarborough', 'Dranchuk-AbuKassem', 'Dranchuk-Purvis-Robinson', 'Beggs-Brill',
  'Papp', Shell and an Artificial Neural Network correlation (Ann10) by 'Kamyab'
  'et al'. The package uses the original 'Standing-Katz' chart for statistical
  comparison and plotting. Applicable to sweet hydrocarbon gases for now.
