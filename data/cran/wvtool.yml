title: Image Tools for Automated Wood Identification
maintainer: Kayoko Kobayashi
description: This tool, wood vision tool, is intended to facilitate preprocessing
  and analyzing 2-dimensional wood images toward automated recognition. The former
  includes some basics such as functions to RGB to grayscale, gray to binary, cropping,
  rotation(bilinear), median/mean/Gaussian filter, and Canny/Sobel edge detection.
  The latter includes gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Haralick parameters,
  local binary pattern (LBP), higher order local autocorrelation (HLAC), Fourier transform
  (radial and azimuthal integration), and Gabor filtering. The functions are intended
  to read data using  'readTIFF(x,info=T)' from 'tiff' package. The functions in this
  packages basically assumes the grayscale images as input data, thus the color images
  should be subjected to the function rgb2gray() before used for some other functions.
