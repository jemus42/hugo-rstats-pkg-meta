  Implements ACME Estimator of Bird and Bat Mortality by Wind
  Turbines
maintainer: Robert Wolpert
description: "Implementation of estimator ACME, described in Wolpert (2015), ACME:
  A  \t\tPartially Periodic Estimator of Avian & Chiropteran Mortality at Wind\nTurbines
  (submitted). Unlike most other models, this estimator\nsupports decreasing-hazard
  Weibull model for persistence;\ndecreasing search proficiency as carcasses age;
  variable\nbleed-through at successive searches; and interval mortality\nestimates.
  The package provides, based on search data, functions\nfor estimating the mortality
  inflation factor in Frequentist and\nBayesian settings."
