description: With the provision of several tools and templates the MOSAIC project
  (DFG-Grant Number HO 1937/2-1) supports the implementation of a central data management
  in epidemiological research projects. The 'MOQA' package enables epidemiologists
  with none or low experience in R to generate basic data quality reports for a wide
  range of application scenarios. See <https://mosaic-greifswald.de/> for more information.
