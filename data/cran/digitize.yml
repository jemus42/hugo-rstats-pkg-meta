title: Use Data from Published Plots in R
maintainer: Jaime Ashander
description: |-
  Import data from a digital image; it requires user input for
  calibration and to locate the data points. The end result is similar to
  'DataThief' and other other programs that 'digitize' published plots or
  graphs.
