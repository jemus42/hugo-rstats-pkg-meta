description: Statistical tests widely utilized in biostatistics, public policy, and
  law. Along with the well-known tests for equality of means and variances, randomness,
  and measures of relative variability, the package contains new robust tests of symmetry,
  omnibus and directional tests of normality, and their graphical counterparts such
  as robust QQ plot, robust trend tests for variances, etc. All implemented tests
  and methods are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal statistics,
  economics, and biostatistics.
