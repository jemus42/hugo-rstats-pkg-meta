description: |-
  The true random number service provided by the RANDOM.ORG
  website created by Mads Haahr samples atmospheric noise via radio tuned to
  an unused broadcasting frequency together with a skew correction algorithm
  due to John von Neumann.  More background is available in the included
  vignette based on an essay by Mads Haahr.  In its current form, the package
  offers functions to retrieve random integers, randomized sequences and
  random strings.
