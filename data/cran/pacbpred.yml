  PAC-Bayesian Estimation and Prediction in Sparse Additive
  Models.
maintainer: Benjamin Guedj
description: |-
  This package is intended to perform estimation and
  prediction in high-dimensional additive models, using a sparse
  PAC-Bayesian point of view and a MCMC algorithm. The method is
  fully described in Guedj and Alquier (2013), 'PAC-Bayesian
  Estimation and Prediction in Sparse Additive Models',
  Electronic Journal of Statistics, 7, 264--291.
