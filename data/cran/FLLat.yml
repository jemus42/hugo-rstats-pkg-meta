title: Fused Lasso Latent Feature Model
maintainer: Gen Nowak
description: Fits the Fused Lasso Latent Feature model, which is used for modeling
  multi-sample aCGH data to identify regions of copy number variation (CNV).  Produces
  a set of features that describe the patterns of CNV and a set of weights that describe
  the composition of each sample.  Also provides functions for choosing the optimal
  tuning parameters and the appropriate number of features, and for estimating the
  false discovery rate.
