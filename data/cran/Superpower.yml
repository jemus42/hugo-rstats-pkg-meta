title: Simulation-Based Power Analysis for Factorial Designs
maintainer: Aaron Caldwell
description: Functions to perform simulations of ANOVA designs of up to three factors.
  Calculates the observed power and average observed effect size for all main effects
  and interactions in the ANOVA, and all simple comparisons between conditions. Includes
  functions for analytic power calculations and additional helper functions that compute
  effect sizes for ANOVA designs, observed error rates in the simulations, and functions
  to plot power curves. Please see Lakens, D., & Caldwell, A. R. (2019). "Simulation-Based
  Power-Analysis for Factorial ANOVA Designs". <doi:10.31234/osf.io/baxsf>.
