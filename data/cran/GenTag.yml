title: Generate Color Tag Sequences
maintainer: Carlos Biagolini-Jr.<c.biagolini@gmail.com>
description: Implement a coherent and flexible protocol for animal color tagging.
  'GenTag' provides a simple computational routine with low CPU usage to create color
  sequences for animal tag. First, a single-color tag sequence is created from an
  algorithm selected by the user, followed by verification of the combination uniqueness.
  Three methods to produce color tag sequences are provided. Users can modify the
  main function core to allow a wide range of applications.
