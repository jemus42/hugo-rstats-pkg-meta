maintainer: Olli Saarela
description: An extended version of the nonparametric Bayesian monotonic regression
  procedure described in Saarela & Arjas (2011) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2010.00716.x>,
  allowing for multiple additive monotonic components in the linear predictor, and
  time-to-event outcomes through case-base sampling. The extension and its applications,
  including estimation of absolute risks, are described in Saarela & Arjas (2015)
