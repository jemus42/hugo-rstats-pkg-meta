title: Weighted Cumulative Exposure Models
maintainer: Marie-Pierre Sylvestre
description: A flexible method for modeling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures,
  weighted according to their relative proximity in time, and represented by time-dependent
  covariates. The current implementation estimates the weight function in the Cox
  proportional hazards model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in
  the past is estimated using cubic regression splines.
