title: Sparse Matrix Estimation and Inference
maintainer: Adam B Kashlak
description: |-
  The 'sparseMatEst' package provides functions for estimating sparse
  covariance and precision matrices with error control. A false positive
  rate is fixed corresponding to the probability of falsely including a matrix
  entry in the support of the estimator.  It uses the binary search
  method outlined in Kashlak and Kong (2019) <arXiv:1705.02679> and in
  Kashlak (2019) <arXiv:1903.10988>.
