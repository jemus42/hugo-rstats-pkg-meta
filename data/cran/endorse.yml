  Bayesian Measurement Models for Analyzing Endorsement
  Experiments
maintainer: Yuki Shiraito
description: Fit the hierarchical and non-hierarchical Bayesian measurement models
  proposed by Bullock, Imai, and Shapiro (2011) <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpr031> to analyze
  endorsement experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a survey methodology for eliciting
  truthful responses to sensitive questions.  This methodology is helpful when measuring
  support for socially sensitive political actors such as militant groups.  The model
  is fitted with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and produces the output containing
  draws from the posterior distribution.
