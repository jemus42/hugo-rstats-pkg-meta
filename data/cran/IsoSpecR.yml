maintainer: Matteo Lacki
description: |-
  IsoSpec is a fine structure calculator used for obtaining the most
  probable masses of a chemical compound given the frequencies of the composing
  isotopes and their masses. It finds the smallest set of isotopologues with
  a given probability. The probability is assumed to be that of the product of
  multinomial distributions, each corresponding to one particular element and
  parametrized by the frequencies of finding these elements in nature. These
  numbers are supplied by IUPAC - the International Union of Pure and Applied
  Chemistry.
