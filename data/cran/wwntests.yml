title: Hypothesis Tests for Functional Time Series
maintainer: Daniel Petoukhov
description: |-
  Provides an array of white noise hypothesis tests for functional data and related visualizations.
  These include tests based on the norms of autocovariance operators that are built under both strong and weak
  white noise assumptions. Additionally, tests based on the spectral density operator and on principal component
  dimensional reduction are included, which are built under strong white noise assumptions. These methods are
  described in Kokoszka et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2017.08.004>, Characiejus and Rice (2019)
  <doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2019.01.003>, and Gabrys and Kokoszka (2007) <doi:10.1198/016214507000001111>,
  respectively.
