title: Simulating Triad Genomewide Genotypes
maintainer: Min Shi
description: Simulate genotypes for case-parent triads, case-control, and quantitative
  trait samples with realistic linkage diequilibrium structure and allele frequency
  distribution. For studies of epistasis one can simulate models that involve specific
  SNPs at specific sets of loci, which we will refer to as "pathways". TriadSim generates
  genotype data by resampling triad genotypes from existing data. The details of the
  method is described in the manuscript under preparation "Simulating Autosomal Genotypes
  with Realistic Linkage Disequilibrium and a Spiked in Genetic Effect" Shi, M., Umbach,
  D.M., Wise A.S., Weinberg, C.R.
