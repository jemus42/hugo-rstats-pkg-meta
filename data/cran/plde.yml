title: Penalized Log-Density Estimation Using Legendre Polynomials
maintainer: JungJun Lee
description: We present a penalized log-density estimation method using Legendre polynomials
  with lasso penalty to adjust estimate's smoothness. Re-expressing the logarithm
  of the density estimator via a linear combination of Legendre polynomials, we can
  estimate parameters by maximizing the penalized log-likelihood function. Besides,
  we proposed an implementation strategy that builds on the coordinate decent algorithm,
  together with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
