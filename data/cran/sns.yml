title: Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS)
maintainer: Alireza Mahani
description: Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS) is a Metropolis-Hastings-based, Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability density
  functions (PDFs) where the proposal density function is a multivariate Gaussian
  resulting from a second-order Taylor-series expansion of log-density around the
  current point. The mean of the Gaussian proposal is the full Newton-Raphson step
  from the current point. A Boolean flag allows for switching from SNS to Newton-Raphson
  optimization (by choosing the mean of proposal function as next point). This can
  be used during burn-in to get close to the mode of the PDF (which is unique due
  to concavity). For high-dimensional densities, mixing can be improved via 'state
  space partitioning' strategy, in which SNS is applied to disjoint subsets of state
  space, wrapped in a Gibbs cycle. Numerical differentiation is available when analytical
  expressions for gradient and Hessian are not available. Facilities for validation
  and numerical differentiation of log-density are provided.
