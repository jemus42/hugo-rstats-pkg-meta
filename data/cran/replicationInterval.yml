version: 2.0.1
title: Replication Interval Functions
maintainer: David Stanley
description: |-
  A common problem faced by journal reviewers and authors is the question of
  whether the results of a replication study are consistent with the original
  published study. One solution to this problem is to examine the effect size
  from the original study and generate the range of effect sizes that could
  reasonably be obtained (due to random sampling) in a replication attempt
  (i.e., calculate a replication interval). If a replication effect size falls
  outside the replication interval, then that effect likely did not occur
  due to the effects of sampling error alone. Alternatively, if a replication
  effect size falls within the replication interval, then the replication
  effect could have reasonably occurred due to the effects of sampling error
  alone. This package has functions that calculate the replication interval for
  the correlation (i.e., r), standardized mean difference (i.e., d-value), and mean.
  The calculations used in version 2.0.0 and onward differ from past calculations
  due to feedback during the journal review process. The new calculations allow
  for a more precise interpretation of the replication interval.
