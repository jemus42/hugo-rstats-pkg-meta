title: Geometric Shadow Calculations
maintainer: Michael Dorman
description: 'Functions for calculating: (1) shadow height, (2) logical shadow flag,
  (3) shadow footprint, (4) Sky View Factor and (5) radiation load. Basic required
  inputs include a polygonal layer of obstacle outlines along with their heights (i.e.
  "extruded polygons"), sun azimuth and sun elevation. The package also provides functions
  for related preliminary calculations: breaking polygons into line segments, determining
  azimuth of line segments, shifting segments by azimuth and distance, constructing
  the footprint of a line-of-sight between an observer and the sun, and creating a
  3D grid covering the surface area of extruded polygons.'
