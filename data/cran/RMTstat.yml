title: Distributions, Statistics and Tests derived from Random Matrix<U+000a>Theory
maintainer: Patrick O. Perry
description: <U+000a>Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions<U+000a>related
  to the eigenvalues of large Wishart matrices.<U+000a>The tables for computing the
  Tracy-Widom densities and distribution<U+000a>functions were computed by Momar Dieng's
  MATLAB package "RMLab"<U+000a>(formerly available on his homepage at<U+000a>http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm
  ).<U+000a>This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone,<U+000a>Zongming
  Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon be<U+000a>replaced by a package
  with more accuracy and built-in support for<U+000a>relevant statistical tests.
