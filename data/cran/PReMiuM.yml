title: Dirichlet Process Bayesian Clustering, Profile Regression
maintainer: Silvia Liverani
description: Bayesian clustering using a Dirichlet process mixture model. This model
  is an alternative to regression models, non-parametrically linking a response vector
  to covariate data through cluster membership. The package allows Bernoulli, Binomial,
  Poisson, Normal, survival and categorical response, as well as Normal and discrete
  covariates. It also allows for fixed effects in the response model, where a spatial
  CAR (conditional autoregressive) term can be also included. Additionally, predictions
  may be made for the response, and missing values for the covariates are handled.
  Several samplers and label switching moves are implemented along with diagnostic
  tools to assess convergence. A number of R functions for post-processing of the
  output are also provided. In addition to fitting mixtures, it may additionally be
  of interest to determine which covariates actively drive the mixture components.
  This is implemented in the package as variable selection. The main reference for
  the package is Liverani, Hastie, Azizi, Papathomas and Richardson (2015) <doi:10.18637/jss.v064.i07>.
