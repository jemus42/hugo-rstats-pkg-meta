title: Gibbs Random Fields Analysis
maintainer: Julien Stoehr
description: |-
  Allows calculation on, and
  sampling from Gibbs Random Fields, and more precisely general
  homogeneous Potts model. The primary tool is the exact computation of
  the intractable normalising constant for small rectangular lattices.
  Beside the latter function, it contains method that give exact sample from the likelihood
  for small enough rectangular lattices or approximate sample from the
  likelihood using MCMC samplers for large lattices.
