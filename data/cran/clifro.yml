title: Easily Download and Visualise Climate Data from CliFlo
maintainer: Blake Seers
description: |-
  CliFlo is a web portal to the New Zealand National Climate
  Database and provides public access (via subscription) to around 6,500
  various climate stations (see <https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/> for more
  information). Collating and manipulating data from CliFlo
  (hence clifro) and importing into R for further analysis, exploration and
  visualisation is now straightforward and coherent. The user is required to
  have an internet connection, and a current CliFlo subscription (free) if
  data from stations, other than the public Reefton electronic weather
  station, is sought.
