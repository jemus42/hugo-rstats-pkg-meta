title: Perform the Meta-Analysis for Pathway Enrichment Analysis (MAPE)
maintainer: Kui Shen
description: |-
  Perform the Meta-analysis for Pathway Enrichment (MAPE)
  methods introduced by Shen and Tseng (2010). It includes functions to
  automatically perform MAPE_G (integrating multiple studies at
  gene level), MAPE_P (integrating multiple studies at pathway
  level) and MAPE_I (a hybrid method integrating MAEP_G and
  MAPE_P methods). In the simulation and real data analyses in
  the paper, MAPE_G and MAPE_P have complementary advantages and
  detection power depending on the data structure. In general,
  the integrative form of MAPE_I is recommended to use. In the
  case that MAPE_G (or MAPE_P) detects almost none pathway, the
  integrative MAPE_I does not improve performance and MAPE_P (or
  MAPE_G) should be used. Reference: Shen, Kui, and George C
