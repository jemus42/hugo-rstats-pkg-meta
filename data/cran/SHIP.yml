title: SHrinkage covariance Incorporating Prior knowledge
maintainer: Vincent Guillemot
description: |-
  The SHIP-package allows the estimation of various types of
  shrinkage covariance matrices. These types differ in terms of
  the so-called covariance target (to be chosen by the user), the
  highly structured matrix which the standard unbiased sample
  covariance matrix is shrunken towards and which optionally
  incorporates prior biological knowledge extracted from the
  database KEGG. The shrinkage intensity is obtained via an
  analytical procedure.
