title: Fast Algorithms for Best Subset Selection
maintainer: Hussein Hazimeh
description: |-
  Highly optimized toolkit for approximately solving L0-regularized learning problems (aka best subset selection).
  The algorithms are based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial search.
  For more details, check the paper by Hazimeh and Mazumder (2018) <arXiv:1803.01454>;
