  Fast K-Mer Counting and Clustering for Biological Sequence
  Analysis
maintainer: Shaun Wilkinson
description: |-
  Contains tools for rapidly computing distance matrices
  and clustering large sequence datasets using fast alignment-free
  k-mer counting and recursive k-means partitioning.
  See Vinga and Almeida (2003) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btg005>
  for a review of k-mer counting methods and applications for
  biological sequence analysis.
