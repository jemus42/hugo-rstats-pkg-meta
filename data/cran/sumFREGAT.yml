title: Fast Region-Based Association Tests on Summary Statistics
maintainer: Nadezhda M. Belonogova
description: |-
  An adaptation of classical region/gene-based association analysis
  techniques to the use of summary statistics (P values and effect sizes)
  and correlations between genetic variants as input. It is a tool to perform
  the most popular and efficient gene-based tests using the results of genome-wide
  association (meta-)analyses without having the original genotypes and
  phenotypes at hand.
