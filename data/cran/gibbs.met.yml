title: Naive Gibbs Sampling with Metropolis Steps
maintainer: Longhai Li
description: |-
  This package provides two generic functions for performing
  Markov chain sampling in a naive way for a user-defined target
  distribution, which involves only continuous variables. The
  function "gibbs_met" performs Gibbs sampling with each
  1-dimensional distribution sampled with Metropolis update using
  Gaussian proposal distribution centered at the previous state.
  The function "met_gaussian" updates the whole state with
  Metropolis method using independent Gaussian proposal
  distribution centered at the previous state. The sampling is
  carried out without considering any special tricks for
  improving efficiency. This package is aimed at only routine
  applications of MCMC in moderate-dimensional problems.
