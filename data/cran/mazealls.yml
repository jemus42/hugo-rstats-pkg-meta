title: Generate Recursive Mazes
maintainer: Steven E. Pav
description: |-
  Supports the generation of parallelogram, equilateral
  triangle, regular hexagon, isosceles trapezoid, Koch snowflake,
  'hexaflake', Sierpinski triangle, Sierpinski carpet and Sierpinski
  trapezoid mazes via 'TurtleGraphics'. Mazes are generated by the recursive method:
  the domain is divided into sub-domains in which mazes are generated,
  then dividing lines with holes are drawn between them, see
  J. Buck, Recursive Division, <http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm>.
