title: Multiple Comparisons Using Normal Approximation
maintainer: Frank Schaarschmidt
description: |-
  Multiple contrast tests and simultaneous confidence
  intervals based on normal approximation. With implementations for
  binomial proportions in a 2xk setting (risk difference and odds ratio),
  poly-3-adjusted tumour rates, biodiversity indices (multinomial data)
  and expected values under lognormal assumption. Approximative power
  calculation for multiple contrast tests of binomial and Gaussian data.
