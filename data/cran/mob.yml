title: Monotonic Optimal Binning
maintainer: WenSui Liu
description: |-
  Generate the monotonic binning and
  perform the woe (weight of evidence) transformation for the logistic regression
  used in the consumer credit scorecard development. The woe transformation is a piecewise
  transformation that is linear to the log odds. For a numeric variable, all of its monotonic
  functional transformations will converge to the same woe transformation.
