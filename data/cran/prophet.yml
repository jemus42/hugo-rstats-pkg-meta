title: Automatic Forecasting Procedure
maintainer: Sean Taylor
description: |-
  Implements a procedure for forecasting time series data based on
  an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and
  daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series
  that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
  Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically
  handles outliers well.
