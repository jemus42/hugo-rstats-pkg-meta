title: Histogram-Valued Data Analysis
maintainer: Antonio Irpino
description: |-
  In the framework of Symbolic Data Analysis, a relatively new
  approach to the statistical analysis of multi-valued data, we consider
  histogram-valued data, i.e., data described by univariate histograms. The
  methods and the basic statistics for histogram-valued data are mainly based
  on the L2 Wasserstein metric between distributions, i.e., the Euclidean metric
  between quantile functions. The package contains unsupervised classification
  techniques, least square regression and tools for histogram-valued data and for
  histogram time series. An introducing paper is Irpino A. Verde R. (2015) <doi:10.1007/s11634-014-0176-4>.
