title: Analysis of Accelerated Destructive Degradation Test Data
maintainer: Yili Hong
description: Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT) are often used to collect
  necessary data for assessing the long-term properties of polymeric materials. Based
  on the collected data, a thermal index (TI) is estimated. The TI can be useful for
  material rating and comparison. This package implements the traditional method based
  on the least-squares method, the parametric method based on maximum likelihood estimation,
  and the semiparametric method based on spline methods, and the corresponding methods
  for estimating TI for polymeric materials. The traditional approach is a two-step
  approach that is currently used in industrial standards, while the parametric method
  is widely used in the statistical literature. The semiparametric method is newly
  developed. Both the parametric and semiparametric approaches allow one to do statistical
  inference such as quantifying uncertainties in estimation, hypothesis testing, and
  predictions. Publicly available datasets are provided illustrations. More details
  can be found in Jin et al. (2017).
