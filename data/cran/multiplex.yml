title: Algebraic Tools for the Analysis of Multiple Social Networks
maintainer: Antonio Rivero Ostoic
description: |-
  Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social networks are delivered with this
  package as described in Ostoic (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.i11>. Among other things, it
  makes it possible to create and manipulate multiplex, multimode, and multilevel network data
  with different formats. There are effective ways available to treat multiple networks with
  routines that combine algebraic systems like the partially ordered semigroup or the semiring
  structure with the relational bundles occurring in different types of multivariate network
  data sets. It also provides an algebraic approach for affiliation networks through Galois
  derivations between families of the pairs of subsets in the two domains.
