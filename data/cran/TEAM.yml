title: Multiple Hypothesis Testing on an Aggregation Tree Method
maintainer: John Pura
description: |-
  An implementation of the TEAM algorithm to identify local differences
  between two (e.g. case and control) independent, univariate distributions, as
  described in J Pura, C Chan, and J Xie (2019) <arXiv:1906.07757>. The algorithm
  is based on embedding a multiple-testing procedure on a hierarchical structure
  to identify high-resolution differences between two distributions. The
  hierarchical structure is designed to identify strong, short-range differences
  at lower layers and weaker, but long-range differences at increasing layers.
  TEAM yields consistent layer-specific and overall false discovery rate control.
