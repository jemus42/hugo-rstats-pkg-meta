  Genotype Probabilities in Intermediate Generations of Inbreeding
  Through Selfing
maintainer: Frank Technow
description: |-
  A probability tree allows to compute probabilities of
  complex events, such as genotype probabilities in intermediate generations of inbreeding
  through recurrent self-fertilization (selfing). This package implements functionality to compute
  probability trees for two- and three-marker genotypes in the F2 to F7 selfing
  generations. The conditional probabilities are derived automatically
  and in symbolic form. The package also provides functionality to
  extract and evaluate the relevant probabilities.
