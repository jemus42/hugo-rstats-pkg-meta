title: Distance-Based Measures of Spatial Structures
maintainer: Eric Marcon
description: |-
  Simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects, following Marcon, Traissac, Puech, and Lang (2015) <doi:10.18637/jss.v067.c03>.
  Includes classical functions (Ripley's K and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's Kd, Marcon and Puech's M).
  Relies on 'spatstat' for some core calculation.
