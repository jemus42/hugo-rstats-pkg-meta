title: Easily Obtain Spatial Data and Make Better Maps
maintainer: Michael Mahoney
description: |-
  One of the remaining pain points in making beautiful maps via
  packages like 'rayshader' is both obtaining and processing spatial data
  to build from. 'spacey' aims to make it easier to obtain and use this data
  for locations within the United States, providing utilities to download
  'USGS' and 'ESRI' geospatial data and quickly turn it into maps.
