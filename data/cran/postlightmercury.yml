title: Parses Web Pages using Postlight Mercury
maintainer: Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm
description: |-
  This is a wrapper for the Mercury Parser API. The Mercury Parser is
  a single API endpoint that takes a URL and gives you back the content reliably
  and easily.
  With just one API request, Mercury takes any web article and returns
  only the relevant content — headline, author, body text, relevant images and
  more — free from any clutter. It’s reliable, easy-to-use and free.
  See the webpage here: <https://mercury.postlight.com/>.
