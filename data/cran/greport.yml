maintainer: Frank E Harrell Jr
description: |-
  Contains many functions useful for
  monitoring and reporting the results of clinical trials and other
  experiments in which treatments are compared.  LaTeX is
  used to typeset the resulting reports, recommended to be in the
  context of 'knitr'. The 'Hmisc', 'ggplot2', and 'lattice' packages are used
  by 'greport' for high-level graphics.
