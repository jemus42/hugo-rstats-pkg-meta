title: Calculate Power and Sample Size with Beta Regression
maintainer: Jinpu Li
description: |-
  Power calculations are a critical component of any research study to determine the
  minimum sample size necessary to detect differences between multiple groups.
  Researchers often work with data taking the form of proportions that can be modeled with
  a beta distribution. Here we present an R package, 'BetaPASS', that perform power and
  sample size calculations for data following a beta distribution with comparative
  nonparametric output. This package allows flexibility with multiple options for link
  functions to fit the data and graphing functionality for visual comparisons.
