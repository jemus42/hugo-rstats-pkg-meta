title: Whitening and High-Dimensional Canonical Correlation Analysis
maintainer: Korbinian Strimmer
description: |-
  Implements the whitening methods (ZCA, PCA, Cholesky,
  ZCA-cor, and PCA-cor) discussed in Kessy, Lewin, and Strimmer (2018)
  "Optimal whitening and decorrelation", <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1277159>,
  as well as the whitening approach to canonical correlation analysis allowing
  negative canonical correlations described in Jendoubi and Strimmer (2019)
  "A whitening approach to probabilistic canonical correlation analysis for omics
  data integration", <doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2572-9>.
