title: '''iCalendar'' Parsing'
maintainer: Peter Meissner
description: |-
  A simple wrapper around the 'ical.js' library executing
  'Javascript' code via 'V8' (the 'Javascript' engine driving the 'Chrome'
  browser and 'Node.js' and accessible via the 'V8' R package).
  This package enables users to parse 'iCalendar' files ('.ics', '.ifb',
  '.iCal', '.iFBf') into lists and 'data.frames' to ultimately do statistics
  on events, meetings, schedules, birthdays, and the like.
