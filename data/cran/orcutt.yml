title: Estimate Procedure in Case of First Order Autocorrelation
maintainer: Stefano Spada
description: Solve first order autocorrelation problems using an iterative method.
  This procedure estimates both autocorrelation and beta coefficients recursively
  until we reach the convergence (8th decimal as default). The residuals are computed
  after estimating Beta using EGLS approach and Rho is estimated using the previous
  residuals.
