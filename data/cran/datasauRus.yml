title: Datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen
maintainer: Steph Locke
description: |-
  The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same summary statistics. They
  retain the same summary statistics despite having radically different distributions.
  The datasets represent a larger and quirkier object lesson that is typically taught
  via Anscombe's Quartet (available in the 'datasets' package). Anscombe's Quartet
  contains four very different distributions with the same summary statistics and as
  such highlights the value of visualisation in understanding data, over and above
  summary statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet, the data
  is generated in a novel way. The simulated annealing process used to derive datasets
  from the original Datasaurus is detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating
  Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing"
