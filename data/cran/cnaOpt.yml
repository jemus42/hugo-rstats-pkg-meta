  Optimizing Consistency and Coverage in Configurational Causal
  Modeling
maintainer: Mathias Ambuehl
description: This is an add-on to the 'cna' package <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cna>
  comprising various functions for optimizing consistency and coverage scores of models
  of configurational comparative methods as Coincidence Analysis (CNA) and Qualitative
  Comparative Analysis (QCA). The function conCovOpt() calculates con-cov optima,
  selectMax() selects con-cov maxima among the con-cov optima, DNFbuild() can be used
  to build models actually reaching those optima, and findOutcomes() identifies those
  factor values in analyzed data that can be modeled as outcomes. For a theoretical
  introduction to these functions see <https://people.uib.no/mba110/docs/ConCovOpt.pdf>.
