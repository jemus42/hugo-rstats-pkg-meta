title: Building Diversity Models from Multiple Species Occupancy Models
maintainer: Derek Corcoran
description: Predictions of alpha diversity are fitted from presence data, first abundance
  is modeled from occupancy models and then, several diversity indices are calculated
  and finally GLM models are used to predict diversity in different environments and
  select priority areas.
