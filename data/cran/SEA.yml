title: Segregation Analysis

description: A few major genes and a series of polygene are responsive for each quantitative
  trait. Major genes are individually identified while polygene is collectively detected.
  This is mixed major genes plus polygene inheritance analysis or segregation analysis
  (SEA). In the SEA, phenotypes from a single or multiple segregation populations
  along with their parents are used to fit all the possible models and the best model
  is viewed as the model of the trait. There are fourteen combinations of populations
  available. Zhang YM, Gai JY, Yang YH (2003) <doi:10.1017/S0016672303006141>.
