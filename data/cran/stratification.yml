title: Univariate Stratification of Survey Populations
maintainer: Louis-Paul Rivest
description: |-
  Univariate stratification of survey populations with a generalization of the
  Lavallee-Hidiroglou method of stratum construction. The generalized method takes into account
  a discrepancy between the stratification variable and the survey variable. The determination
  of the optimal boundaries also incorporate, if desired, an anticipated non-response, a take-all
  stratum for large units, a take-none stratum for small units, and a certainty stratum to ensure
  that some specific units are in the sample. The well known cumulative root frequency rule of
  Dalenius and Hodges and the geometric rule of Gunning and Horgan are also implemented.
