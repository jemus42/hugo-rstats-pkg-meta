description: |-
  Tools for the analysis of psychophysical data. This package allows to estimate the Point of Subjective Equivalence (PSE)
  and the Just Noticeable Difference (JND), either from a psychometric function or from a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM).
  Additionally, the package allows plotting the fitted models and the response data, simulating psychometric functions of different shapes, and simulating data sets.
  For a description of the use of GLMMs applied to psychophysical data, refer to Moscatelli et al. (2012), <doi:10.1167/12.11.26>.
