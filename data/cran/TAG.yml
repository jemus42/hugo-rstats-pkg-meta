title: Transformed Additive Gaussian Processes
maintainer: Li-Hsiang Lin
description: Implement the transformed additive Gaussian (TAG) process and the  transformed
  approximately additive Gaussian (TAAG) process proposed in Lin and Joseph (2019+)
  <DOI:10.1080/00401706.2019.1665592>. These functions can be used to model deterministic
  computer experiments, obtain predictions at new inputs, and quantify the uncertainty
  of the predictions.
