  Batch Effect Removal and Addon Normalization (in Phenotype
  Prediction using Gene Data)
maintainer: Roman Hornung
description: |-
  Various tools dealing with batch effects, in particular enabling the
  removal of discrepancies between training and test sets in prediction scenarios.
  Moreover, addon quantile normalization and addon RMA normalization (Kostka & Spang,
  2008) is implemented to enable integrating the quantile normalization step into
  prediction rules. The following batch effect removal methods are implemented:
  FAbatch, ComBat, (f)SVA, mean-centering, standardization, Ratio-A and Ratio-G.
  For each of these we provide  an additional function which enables a posteriori
  ('addon') batch effect removal in independent batches ('test data'). Here, the
  (already batch effect adjusted) training data is not altered. For evaluating the
  success of batch effect adjustment several metrics are provided. Moreover, the
  package implements a plot for the visualization of batch effects using principal
  component analysis. The main functions of the package for batch effect adjustment
  are ba() and baaddon() which enable batch effect removal and addon batch effect
  removal, respectively, with one of the seven methods mentioned above. Another
  important function here is bametric() which is a wrapper function for all implemented
  methods for evaluating the success of batch effect removal. For (addon) quantile
  normalization and (addon) RMA normalization the functions qunormtrain(),
  qunormaddon(), rmatrain() and rmaaddon() can be used.
