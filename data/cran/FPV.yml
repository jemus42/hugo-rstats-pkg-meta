title: Testing Hypotheses via Fuzzy P-Value in Fuzzy Environment
maintainer: Abbas Parchami
description: 'The main goal of this package is drawing the membership function of
  the fuzzy p-value which is defined as a fuzzy set on the unit interval for three
  following problems: (1) testing crisp hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Filzmoser
  and Viertl (2004) <doi:10.1007/s001840300269>, (2) testing fuzzy hypotheses based
  on crisp data, see Parchami et al. (2010) <doi:10.1007/s00362-008-0133-4>, and (3)
  testing fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Parchami et al. (2012) <doi:10.1007/s00362-010-0353-2>.
  In all cases, the fuzziness of data or / and the fuzziness of the boundary of null
  fuzzy hypothesis transported via the p-value function and causes to produce the
  fuzzy p-value. If the p-value is fuzzy, it is more appropriate to consider a fuzzy
  significance level for the problem. Therefore, the comparison of the fuzzy p-value
  and the fuzzy significance level is evaluated by a fuzzy ranking method in this
  package.'
