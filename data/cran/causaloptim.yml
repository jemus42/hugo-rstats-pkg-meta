  An Interface to Specify Causal Graphs and Compute Bounds on
  Causal Effects
maintainer: Michael C Sachs
description: |-
  When causal quantities are not identifiable from the observed data, it still may be possible
  to bound these quantities using the observed data. We outline a class of problems for which the
  derivation of tight bounds is always a linear programming problem and can therefore, at least
  theoretically, be solved using a symbolic linear optimizer. We extend and generalize the
  approach of Balke and Pearl (1994) <doi:10.1016/B978-1-55860-332-5.50011-0> and we provide
  a user friendly graphical interface for setting up such problems via directed acyclic
  graphs (DAG), which only allow for problems within this class to be depicted. The user can
  then define linear constraints to further refine their assumptions to meet their specific
  problem, and then specify a causal query using a text interface. The program converts this
  user defined DAG, query, and constraints, and returns tight bounds. The bounds can be
  converted to R functions to evaluate them for specific datasets, and to latex code for
  publication. The methods and proofs of tightness and validity of the bounds are described in
  a preprint by Sachs, Gabriel, and Sj√∂lander (2020)
