  Inverse Probability Weighted Cox Model with Corrected Sandwich
  Variance
maintainer: Di Shu
description: An implementation of corrected sandwich variance (CSV) estimation method
  for making inference of marginal hazard ratios (HR) in inverse probability weighted
  (IPW) Cox model without and with clustered data, proposed by Shu, Young, Toh, and
  Wang (2019) in their paper under revision for Biometrics. Both conventional inverse
  probability weights and stabilized weights are implemented. Logistic regression
  model is assumed for propensity score model.
