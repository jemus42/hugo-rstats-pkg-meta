title: Correct Overloaded Peaks from GC-APCI-MS Data
maintainer: Jan Lisec
description: Analyzes and modifies metabolomics raw data (generated using GC-APCI-MS,
  Gas Chromatography-Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Mass Spectrometry) to
  correct overloaded signals, i.e. ion intensities exceeding detector saturation leading
  to a cut-off peak. Data in xcmsRaw format are accepted as input and mzXML files
  can be processed alternatively. Overloaded signals are detected automatically and
  modified using an Gaussian or Isotopic-Ratio approach, QC plots are generated and
  corrected data are stored within the original xcmsRaw or mzXML respectively to allow
  further processing.
