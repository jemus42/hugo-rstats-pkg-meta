  Models for Continuous Traits Evolving in Macroevolutionary
  Landscapes of any Shape
maintainer: Florian C. Boucher
description: 'Provides a set of functions to fit general macroevolutionary models
  for continuous traits evolving in adaptive landscapes of any shape. This package
  implements the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov model (FPK), in which the trait evolves
  under random diffusion but is also subject to a force that pulls it towards specific
  values - this force can be of any shape. FPK has a version in which hard reflective
  bounds exist at the extremes of the trait interval: this second model is called
  BBMV.'
