title: Efficient Sequential Testing with Evidence Ratios
maintainer: Ladislas Nalborczyk
description: |-
  An implementation of sequential testing that uses evidence ratios
  computed from the weights of a set of models. These weights correspond either
  to Akaike weights computed from the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the
  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and following Burnham & Anderson
  (2004, <doi:10.1177/0049124104268644>) recommendations, or to pseudo-BMA
  weights computed from the WAIC or the LOO-IC of models fitted
  with 'brms' and following Yao et al. (2017, <arXiv:1704.02030v3>).
