title: Parsing, Applying, and Manipulating Data Cleaning Rules
maintainer: Edwin de Jonge
description: |-
  Facilitates reading and manipulating (multivariate) data restrictions
  (edit rules) on numerical and categorical data. Rules can be defined with common R syntax
  and parsed to an internal (matrix-like format). Rules can be manipulated with
  variable elimination and value substitution methods, allowing for feasibility checks
  and more. Data can be tested against the rules and erroneous fields can be found based
  on Fellegi and Holt's generalized principle. Rules dependencies can be visualized with
  using the 'igraph' package.
