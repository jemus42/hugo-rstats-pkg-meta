title: Calculate Design Parameters for Biomarker Validation Studies
maintainer: Roger Day
description: |-
  Helps a clinical trial team  discuss
  the clinical goals  of a well-defined biomarker with a diagnostic,
  staging, prognostic, or predictive purpose.  From this discussion will
  come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial.
  Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific
  focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of
  "discomfort" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The meaning of
  the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that within this range
  most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding
  treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg,
  become the targets of the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate
  that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower,
  and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower,
  then the biomarker may be useful for patients. A highlight of the package
  is visualization of a "contra-Bayes" theorem, which produces criteria for
  retrospective case-controls studies.
