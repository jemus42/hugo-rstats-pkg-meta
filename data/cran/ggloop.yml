title: Create 'ggplot2' Plots in a Loop
maintainer: Luke Smith
description: |-
  Pass a data frame and mapping aesthetics to ggloop() in order
  to create a list of 'ggplot2' plots. The way x-y and dots are paired together
  is controlled by the remapping arguments. Geoms, themes, facets, and other
  features can be added with the special %L+% (L-plus) operator.
