  An Framework for Reducing Elemental LAICPMS Data from Solid
  Structures
maintainer: Charlotte Sirot
description: Aims to facilitate the reduction of elemental microchemistry data from
  solid-phase LAICPMS analysis (laser ablation inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry).
  The 'elementR' package provides a reactive and user friendly interface (based on
  a 'shiny' application) and a set of 'R6' classes for conducting all steps needed
  for an optimal data reduction while leaving maximum control for user.
