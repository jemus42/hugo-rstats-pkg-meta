title: Utilities for Generating SQL Queries from Model Objects
maintainer: William Brannon
description: |-
  Provides utilities for generating SQL queries (particularly CREATE
  TABLE statements) from R model objects. The most important use case is
  generating SQL to score a generalized linear model or related model
  represented as an R object, in which case the package handles parsing
  formula operators and including the model's response function.
