maintainer: Jakob Bossek
description: The SciMark 2.0 benchmark was originally developed in Java as a benchmark
  for numerical and scientific computational performance. It measures the performance
  of several computational kernels which are frequently occurring in scientific applications.
  This package is a simple wrapper around the ANSI C implementation of the benchmark.
