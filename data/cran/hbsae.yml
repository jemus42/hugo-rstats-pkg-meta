title: Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation
maintainer: Harm Jan Boonstra
description: |-
  Functions to compute small area estimates based on a basic
  area or unit-level model. The model is fit using restricted
  maximum likelihood, or in a hierarchical Bayesian way. In the
  latter case numerical integration is used to average over the
  posterior density for the between-area variance.  The output
  includes the model fit, small area estimates and corresponding
  MSEs, as well as some model selection measures. Additional
  functions provide means to compute aggregate estimates and
  MSEs, to minimally adjust the small area estimates to
  benchmarks at a higher aggregation level, and to graphically
  compare different sets of small area estimates.
