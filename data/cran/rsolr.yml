title: R to Solr Interface
maintainer: Michael Lawrence
description: |-
  A comprehensive R API for querying Apache Solr databases.
  A Solr core is represented as a data frame or list that
  supports Solr-side filtering, sorting,
  transformation and aggregation, all through the familiar
  base R API. Queries are processed
  lazily, i.e., a query is only sent to the database when
  the data are required.
