title: Efficient Constrained Based Modelling
maintainer: Mayo Roettger
description: This Systems Biology Package (Gelius-Dietrich et. al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-125>)
  implements algorithms for constraint based analyses of metabolic networks, e.g.
  flux-balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), regulatory
  on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness analysis and flux variability analysis. The
  package is easily extendable for additional algorithms. Most of the current LP/MILP
  solvers are supported via additional packages.
