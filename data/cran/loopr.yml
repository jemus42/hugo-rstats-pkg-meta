  Uses an Archive to Amend Previous Stages of a Pipe using Current
  Output
maintainer: Brandon Taylor
description: |-
  Remedies a common problem in piping: not having access to
  intermediate outputs of the pipe. Within a "loop", a piping intermediate
  is  stored in a stack archive, data is processed, and then both the
  stored intermediate and the current output are reintegrated using an
  "ending" function. Two special ending functions are provided: amend and
  insert. However, any ending function can be specified, including merge
  functions, join functions, setNames(), etc. This framework allows the
  following work-flow: focus on a particular aspect or section of a
  data set, conduct specific operations, and then reintegrate changes into
  the whole.
