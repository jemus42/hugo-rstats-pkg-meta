title: Seek the Significant Cutoff Value
maintainer: Jing Zhang
description: |-
  Seek the significant cutoff value for a continuous variable, which will
  be transformed into a classification, for linear regression,
  logistic regression, logrank analysis and cox regression. First of all,
  all combinations will be gotten by combn() function. Then n.per argument,
  abbreviated of total number percentage, will be used to remove the combination
  of smaller data group. In logistic, Cox regression and logrank analysis,
  we will also use p.per argument, patient percentage, to filter the lower
  proportion of patients in each group. Finally, p value in regression
  results will be used to get the significant combinations and output
  relevant parameters. In this package, there is no limit to the number of
  cutoff points, which can be 1, 2, 3 or more. Still, we provide 2 methods,
  typical Bonferroni and Duglas G (1994) <doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.11.829>, to
  adjust the p value, Missing values will be deleted by na.omit() function
  before analysis.
