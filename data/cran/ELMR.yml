maintainer: Alessio Petrozziello
description: Training and prediction functions are provided for the Extreme Learning
  Machine algorithm (ELM). The ELM use a Single Hidden Layer Feedforward Neural Network
  (SLFN) with random generated weights and no gradient-based backpropagation. The
  training time is very short and the online version allows to update the model using
  small chunk of the training set at each iteration. The only parameter to tune is
  the hidden layer size and the learning function.
