title: Computational Graphs
maintainer: Ron Triepels
description: Allows to create, evaluate, and differentiate computational graphs in
  R. A computational graph is a graph representation of a multivariate function decomposed
  by its (elementary) operations. Nodes in the graph represent arrays while edges
  represent dependencies among the arrays. An advantage of expressing a function as
  a computational graph is that this enables to differentiate the function by automatic
  differentiation. The 'cgraph' package supports various operations including basic
  arithmetic, trigonometry operations, and linear algebra operations. It differentiates
  computational graphs by reverse automatic differentiation. The flexible architecture
  of the package makes it applicable to solve a variety of problems including local
  sensitivity analysis, gradient-based optimization, and machine learning.
