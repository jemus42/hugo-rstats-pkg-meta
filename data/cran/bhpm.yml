  Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Models for Multiple Grouped
  Outcomes with Clustering
maintainer: Raymond Carragher
description: 'Bayesian hierarchical methods for the detection of differences in rates
  of related outcomes for multiple treatments for clustered observations. Theoretical
  background for the models is given in Carragher (2017) <https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.736866>.
  The models in this package are extensions for multiple treatments and clusters.
  This software was developed for the Precision Drug Theraputics: Risk Prediction
  in Pharmacoepidemiology project as part of a Rutherford Fund Fellowship at Health
  Data Research (UK), Medical Research Council (UK) award reference MR/S003967/1 (<https://gtr.ukri.org/>).
  Principal Investigator: Raymond Carragher.'
