title: Adaptive Optimal Two-Stage Designs in R
maintainer: Kevin Kunzmann
description: |-
  Optimize one or two-arm, two-stage designs for clinical trials with
  respect to several pre-implemented objective criteria or implement custom
  objectives.
  Optimization under uncertainty and conditional (given stage-one outcome)
  constraints are supported.
  See Pilz M, Kunzmann K, Herrmann C, Rauch G, Kieser M. A variational
  approach to optimal two-stage designs. Statistics in Medicine. 2019;38(21):4159â€“4171.
