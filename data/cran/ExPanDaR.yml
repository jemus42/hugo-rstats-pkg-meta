version: 0.5.1
title: Explore Your Data Interactively
maintainer: Joachim Gassen
description: |-
  Provides a shiny-based front end (the 'ExPanD' app) and
  a set of functions for exploratory data analysis. Run as a web-based
  app, 'ExPanD' enables users to assess the robustness of empirical evidence
  without providing them access to the underlying data. You can export a
  notebook containing the analysis of 'ExPanD' and/or use the functions of the
  package to support your exploratory data analysis workflow. Refer to the
  vignettes of the package for more information on how to use 'ExPanD' and/or
  the functions of this package.
