title: Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) Model
maintainer: Thomas Wieland
description: Market area models are used to analyze and predict store choices and
  market areas concerning retail and service locations. This package implements two
  market area models (Huff Model, Multiplicative Competitive Interaction Model) into
  R, while the emphases lie on 1.) fitting these models based on empirical data via
  OLS regression and nonlinear techniques and 2.) data preparation and processing
  (esp. interaction matrices and data preparation for the MCI Model).
