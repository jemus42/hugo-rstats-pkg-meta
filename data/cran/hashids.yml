title: Generate Short Unique YouTube-Like IDs (Hashes) from Integers
maintainer: Alex Shum
description: 'An R port of the hashids library.  hashids generates YouTube-like hashes
  from integers or vector of integers.  Hashes generated from integers are relatively
  short, unique and non-seqential.  hashids can be used to generate unique ids for
  URLs and hide database row numbers from the user.  By default hashids will avoid
  generating common English cursewords by preventing certain letters being next to
  each other.  hashids are not one-way: it is easy to encode an integer to a hashid
  and decode a hashid back into an integer.'
