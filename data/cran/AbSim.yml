title: Time Resolved Simulations of Antibody Repertoires
maintainer: Alexander Yermanos
description: Simulation methods for the evolution of antibody repertoires. The heavy
  and light chain variable region of both human and C57BL/6 mice can be simulated
  in a time-dependent fashion. Both single lineages using one set of V-, D-, and J-genes
  or full repertoires can be simulated. The algorithm begins with an initial V-D-J
  recombination event, starting the first phylogenetic tree. Upon completion, the
  main loop of the algorithm begins, with each iteration representing one simulated
  time step. Various mutation events are possible at each time step, contributing
  to a diverse final repertoire.
