title: Estimate Inverse Probability Weights
maintainer: Ronald B. Geskus
description: |-
  Functions to estimate the probability to receive the observed treatment, based on
  individual characteristics. The inverse of these probabilities can be used as weights when
  estimating causal effects from observational data via marginal structural models. Both point
  treatment situations and longitudinal studies can be analysed. The same functions can be used to
  correct for informative censoring.
