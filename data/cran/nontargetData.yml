title: Quantized simulation data of isotope pattern centroids
maintainer: Martin Loos
description: Data sets for isotope pattern grouping of LC-HRMS peaks with package
  nontarget. Based on a vast set of unique PubChem molecular formulas, quantized (a)
  m/z, (b) m/z differences, (c) intensity ratios and (d) marker centroids of simulated
  centroid pairs are listed for different instrument resolutions.
