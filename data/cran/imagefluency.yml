title: Image Statistics Based on Processing Fluency
maintainer: Stefan Mayer
description: |-
  Get image statistics based on processing fluency theory. The
  functions provide scores for several basic aesthetic principles that
  facilitate fluent cognitive processing of images: contrast,
  complexity / simplicity, self-similarity, symmetry, and typicality.
  See Mayer & Landwehr (2018) <doi:10.1037/aca0000187> and Mayer & Landwehr
  (2018) <doi:10.31219/osf.io/gtbhw> for the theoretical background of the methods.
