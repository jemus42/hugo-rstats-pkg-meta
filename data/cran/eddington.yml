title: Compute a Cyclist's Eddington Number
maintainer: Paul Egeler
description: |-
  Compute a cyclist's Eddington number, including efficiently
  computing cumulative E over a vector. A cyclist's Eddington number
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling>
  is the maximum number satisfying the condition such that a cyclist has
  ridden E miles or greater in E days. The algorithm in this package is an
  improvement over the conventional approach because both summary statistics
  and cumulative statistics can be computed in linear time, since it does not
  require initial sorting of the data. These functions may also be used for
  computing h-indices for authors, a metric described by Hirsch (2005)
  <doi:10.1073/pnas.0507655102>. Both are specific applications of computing
  the side length of a Durfee square
