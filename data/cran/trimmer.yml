title: Trim an Object
maintainer: Lars Kjeldgaard
description: |-
  A lightweight toolkit to reduce the size of a list object. The
  object is minimized by recursively removing elements from the object
  one-by-one. The process is constrained by a reference function call
  specified by the user, where the target object is given as an argument.
  The procedure will not allow elements to be removed from the object, that
  will cause results from the function call to diverge from the function
  call with the original object.
