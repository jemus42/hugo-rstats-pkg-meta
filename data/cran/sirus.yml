title: Stable and Interpretable RUle Set
maintainer: Clement Benard
description: 'A regression and classification algorithm based on random forests, which
  takes the form of a short list of rules. SIRUS combines the simplicity of decision
  trees with the predictivity of random forests for problems with low order interactions.
  The core aggregation principle of random forests is kept, but instead of aggregating
  predictions, SIRUS selects the most frequent nodes of the forest to form a stable
  rule ensemble model. The algorithm is fully described in the following article:
  Benard C., Biau G., da Veiga S., Scornet E. (2019) <arXiv:1908.06852>. This R package
  is a fork from the project ranger (<https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger>).'
