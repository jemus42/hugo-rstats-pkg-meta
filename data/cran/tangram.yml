version: 0.7.1
title: The Grammar of Tables
maintainer: Shawn Garbett
description: |-
  Provides an extensible formula system to quickly and easily create
  production quality tables. The steps of the process are formula parser,
  statistical content generation from data, to rendering. Each step of the process
  is separate and user definable thus creating a set of building blocks for
  highly extensible table generation. A user is not limited by any of the
  choices of the package creator other than the formula grammar. For example,
  one could chose to add a different S3 rendering function and output a format
  not provided in the default package. Or possibly one would rather have Gini
  coefficients for their statistical content. Routines to achieve New England
  Journal of Medicine style, Lancet style and Hmisc::summaryM() statistics are
  provided. The package contains rendering for HTML5, Rmarkdown and an indexing
  format for use in tracing and tracking are provided.
