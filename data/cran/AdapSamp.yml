title: Adaptive Sampling Algorithms
maintainer: Dong Zhang
description: 'For distributions whose probability density functions are log-concave,
  the adaptive rejection sampling algorithm can be used to build envelope functions
  for sampling. For others, we can use the modified adaptive rejection sampling algorithm,
  the concave-convex adaptive rejection sampling algorithm and the adaptive slice
  sampling algorithm. So we designed an R package mainly including 4 functions: rARS(),
  rMARS(), rCCARS() and rASS(). These functions can realize sampling based on the
  algorithms above.'
