title: Null Model Analysis for Ecological Data
maintainer: Edmund Hart
description: Given a site by species interaction matrix, users can make inferences
  about species interactions by performance hypothesis comparing test statistics against
  a null distribution. The current package provides algorithms and metrics for niche-overlap,
  body size ratios and species co-occurrence. Users can also integrate their own algorithms
  and metrics within these frameworks or completely novel null models. Detailed explanations
  about the underlying assumptions of null model analysis in ecology can be found
  at http://ecosimr.org.
