  A Mixture Model-Based Approach to the Clustering of Microarray
  Expression Data
maintainer: Andrew Thomas Jones
description: |-
  Provides unsupervised selection and clustering of microarray data
  using mixture models. Following the methods described in McLachlan, Bean and
  Peel (2002) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.413> a subset of genes are selected
  based one the likelihood ratio statistic for the test of one versus two
  components when fitting mixtures of t-distributions to the expression data
  for each gene. The dimensionality of this gene subset is further reduced through
  the use of mixtures of factor analyzers, allowing the tissue samples to be
  clustered by fitting mixtures of normal distributions.
