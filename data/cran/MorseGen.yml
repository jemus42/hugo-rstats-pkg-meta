  statistics.
maintainer: Brendan Morse
description: |-
  MorseGen is a program for generating raw data based on
  user-specified summary (descriptive) statistics. Samples based
  on the supplied statistics are drawn from a normal distribution
  (or, in some cases, an exponential distribution) and scaled to
  match the desired descriptive statistics. Intended uses include
  creating raw data that fits desired characteristics or to
  replicate the results in a published study.
