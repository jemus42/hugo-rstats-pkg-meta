  Bayesian Analysis of Generalized Elliptical Semi-Parametric
  Models and Flexible Measurement Error Models
maintainer: Luz Marina Rondon
description: 'Set of tools to perform the statistical inference based on the Bayesian
  approach for regression models under the assumption that independent additive errors
  follow normal, Student-t, slash, contaminated normal, Laplace or symmetric hyperbolic
  distributions, i.e., additive errors follow a scale mixtures of normal distributions.
  The regression models considered in this package are: (i) Generalized elliptical
  semi-parametric models, where both location and dispersion parameters of the response
  variable distribution include non-parametric additive components described by using
  B-splines; and (ii) Flexible measurement error models under the presence of homoscedastic
  and heteroscedastic random errors, which admit explanatory variables with and without
  measurement additive errors as well as the presence of a non-parametric components
  approximated by using B-splines.'
