title: Optimal Power Space Transformation
maintainer: Micha Sammeth
description: |-
  Comparison of data by Pearson product-moment correlation
  coefficients is prone to outliers. The problem can be
  alleviated by normalizing data with outliers before computing
  the Pearson correlation coefficient. The sample provides such
  normalization by optimal power space transformation.
