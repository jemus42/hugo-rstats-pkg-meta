  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic is a standard method to measure the model strength for
  credit risk scoring models. This package calculates the Kâ€“S statistic and
  plots the true-positive rate and false-positive rate to measure the model strength.
  This package was written with the credit marketer, who uses risk models in
  conjunction with his campaigns. The users could read more details from
  Thrasher (1992) <doi:10.1002/dir.4000060408> and 'pyks' <https://pypi.org/project/pyks/>.
