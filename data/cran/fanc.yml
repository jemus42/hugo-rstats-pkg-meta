title: Penalized Likelihood Factor Analysis via Nonconvex Penalty
maintainer: Kei Hirose
description: Computes the penalized maximum likelihood estimates of factor loadings
  and unique variances for various tuning parameters. The pathwise coordinate descent
  along with EM algorithm is used.  This package also includes a new graphical tool
  which outputs path diagram, goodness-of-fit indices and model selection criteria
  for each regularization parameter. The user can change the regularization parameter
  by manipulating scrollbars, which is helpful to find a suitable value of regularization
  parameter.
