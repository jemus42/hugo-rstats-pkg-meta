title: Permutation Based QQ Plot and Inflation Factor Estimation
maintainer: Quanli Wang
description: Provides users the necessary utility functions to generate permutation-based
  QQ plots and also estimate inflation factor based on the empirical NULL distribution.
  While it has general utility, it is particularly helpful when the skewness of the
  Fisher's Exact test in sparse data situations with imbalanced case-control sample
  sizes renders the reliance on the uniform chi-square expected distribution inappropriate.
