title: ACE File to FASTQ Converter
maintainer: Reinhard Simon
description: |-
  The ACE file format is used in genomics to store contigs from sequencing machines.
  This tools converts it into FASTQ format. Both formats contain the
  sequence characters and their
  corresponding quality information. Unlike the FASTQ file, the ace file stores the
  quality values numerically.
  The conversion algorithm uses the standard Sanger formula. The package facilitates insertion
  into pipelines, and content inspection.
