  Stochastic EM Algorithms for Latent Variable Models with a
  High-Dimensional Latent Space
maintainer: Siliang Zhang
description: |-
  Provides stochastic EM algorithms for latent variable models
  with a high-dimensional latent space. So far, we provide functions for confirmatory item
  factor analysis based on the multidimensional two parameter logistic (M2PL) model and the
  generalized multidimensional partial credit model. These functions scale well for problems
  with many latent traits (e.g., thirty or even more) and are virtually tuning-free.
  The computation is facilitated by multiprocessing 'OpenMP' API.
