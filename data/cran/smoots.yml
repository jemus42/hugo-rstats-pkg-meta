title: Nonparametric Estimation of the Trend and Its Derivatives in TS
maintainer: Dominik Schulz
description: |-
  The nonparametric trend and its derivatives in equidistant time
  series (TS) with short-memory stationary errors can be estimated. The
  estimation is conducted via local polynomial regression using an
  automatically selected bandwidth obtained by a built-in iterative plug-in
  algorithm or a bandwidth fixed by the user. A Nadaraya-Watson kernel
  smoother is also built-in as a comparison.
  The methods of the package are described in
  Feng, Y., and Gries, T., (2017) <http://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wp-wiwi/RePEc/pdf/ciepap/WP102.pdf>.
  A current version of the paper that is also referred to in the
  documentation of the functions is prepared for publication.
