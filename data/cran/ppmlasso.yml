title: Point Process Models with LASSO Penalties
maintainer: Ian Renner
description: Toolkit for fitting point process models with sequences of LASSO penalties
  ("regularisation paths"). Regularisation paths of Poisson point process models or
  area-interaction models can be fitted with LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net
  penalties. A number of criteria are available to judge the bias-variance tradeoff.
