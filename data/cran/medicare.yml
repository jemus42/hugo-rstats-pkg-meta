maintainer: Robert Gambrel
description: |-
  Publicly available data from Medicare frequently requires extensive
  initial effort to extract desired variables and merge them; this package
  formalizes the techniques I've found work best. More information on the
  Medicare program, as well as guidance for the publicly available data this package
  targets, can be found on CMS's website covering publicly available data. See <https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems.html>.
