title: Bayesian Treed Gaussian Process Models
maintainer: Robert B. Gramacy
description: |-
  Bayesian nonstationary, semiparametric nonlinear regression
  and design by treed Gaussian processes (GPs) with jumps to the limiting
  linear model (LLM).  Special cases also implemented include Bayesian
  linear models, CART, treed linear models, stationary separable and
  isotropic GPs, and GP single-index models.  Provides 1-d and 2-d plotting functions
  (with projection and slice capabilities) and tree drawing, designed for
  visualization of tgp-class output.  Sensitivity analysis and
  multi-resolution models are supported. Sequential experimental
  design and adaptive sampling functions are also provided, including ALM,
  ALC, and expected improvement.  The latter supports derivative-free
  optimization of noisy black-box functions.
