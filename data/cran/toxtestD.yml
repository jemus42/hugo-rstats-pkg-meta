title: Experimental design for binary toxicity tests
maintainer: Nadia Keddig
description: |-
  Calculates sample size and dose allocation for binary toxicity
  tests, using the Fish Embryo Toxicity Test as example.
  An optimal test design is obtained by running
  (i) spoD (calculate the number of individuals to test under control
  conditions), (ii) setD (estimate the minimal sample size per treatment
  given the users precision requirements) and (iii) doseD (construct
  an individual dose scheme).
