title: Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions
maintainer: John C Nash
description: |-
  Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems.
  It is intended to eventually supersede the 'nls()' function in the R
  distribution. For example, 'nls()' specifically does NOT deal with small
  or zero residual problems as its Gauss-Newton method frequently stops with
  'singular gradient' messages. 'nlsr' is based on the now-deprecated package
  'nlmrt', and has refactored functions and R-language symbolic derivative
  features.
