version: '2.1'
title: Highly Optimized Protocol Buffer Serializers
maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Pure C++ implementations for reading and writing several common data
  formats based on Google protocol-buffers. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for
  serialized R objects, 'geobuf.proto' for binary geojson, and 'mvt.proto' for
  vector tiles. This package uses the auto-generated C++ code by protobuf-compiler,
  hence the entire serialization is optimized at compile time. The 'RProtoBuf'
  package on the other hand uses the protobuf runtime library to provide a general-
  purpose toolkit for reading and writing arbitrary protocol-buffer data in R.
