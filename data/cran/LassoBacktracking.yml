  Modelling Interactions in High-Dimensional Data with
  Backtracking

description: |-
  Implementation of the algorithm introduced in Shah, R. D.
  (2016) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/13-515/13-515.pdf>.
  Data with thousands of predictors can be handled. The algorithm
  performs sequential Lasso fits on design matrices containing
  increasing sets of candidate interactions. Previous fits are used to greatly
  speed up subsequent fits so the algorithm is very efficient.
