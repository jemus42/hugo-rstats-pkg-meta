title: Biodiversity Assessment Using Functional Tools
maintainer: Fabrizio Maturo
description: The main drawback of the most common biodiversity indices is that different
  measures may lead to different rankings among communities. This instrument overcomes
  this limit using some functional tools with the diversity profiles. In particular,
  the derivatives, the curvature, the radius of curvature, the arc length, and the
  surface area are proposed. The goal of this method is to interpret in detail the
  diversity profiles and obtain an ordering between different ecological communities
  on the basis of diversity. In contrast to the typical indices of diversity, the
  proposed method is able to capture the multidimensional aspect of biodiversity,
  because it takes into account both the evenness and the richness of the species
  present in an ecological community.
