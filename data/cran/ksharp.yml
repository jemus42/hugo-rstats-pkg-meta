title: Cluster Sharpening
maintainer: Tomasz Konopka
description: Clustering typically assigns data points into discrete groups, but the
  clusters can sometimes be indistinct. Cluster sharpening adjusts an existing clustering
  to create contrast between groups. This package provides a general interface for
  cluster sharpening along with several implementations based on different excision
  criteria.
