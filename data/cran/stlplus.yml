title: Enhanced Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess
maintainer: Ryan Hafen
description: |-
  Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder
  components using an implementation of Seasonal Decomposition of Time
  Series by Loess (STL) that provides several enhancements over the STL
  method in the stats package.  These enhancements include handling missing
  values, providing higher order (quadratic) loess smoothing with automated
  parameter choices, frequency component smoothing beyond the seasonal and
  trend components, and some basic plot methods for diagnostics.
