title: R Interface to the 'Protocol Buffers' 'API' (Version 2 or 3)
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an
  efficient yet extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all
  of its internal 'RPC' protocols and file formats.  Additional documentation
  is available in two included vignettes one of which corresponds to our 'JSS'
  paper (2016, <doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i02>. Either version 2 or 3 of the
  'Protocol Buffers' 'API' is supported.
