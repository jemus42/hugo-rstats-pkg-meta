description: |-
  Analysis of kin-cohort studies. kin.cohort provides estimates of age-specific
  cumulative risk of a disease for carriers and noncarriers of a mutation. The cohorts are
  retrospectively built from relatives of probands for whom the genotype is known. Currently
  the method of moments and marginal maximum likelihood are implemented. Confidence intervals
  are calculated from bootstrap samples.
  Most of the code is a translation from previous 'MATLAB' code by N. Chatterjee.
