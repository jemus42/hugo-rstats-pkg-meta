title: A New Link Function that Blends Two Specified Link Functions
maintainer: '"Robert Clark"'
description: A new link function that equals one specified link function up to a cutover
  then a linear rescaling of another specified link function. For use in glm() or
  glm2(). The intended use is in binary regression, in which case the first link should
  be set to "log" and the second to "logit". This ensures that fitted probabilities
  are between 0 and 1 and that exponentiated coefficients can be interpreted as relative
  risks for probabilities up to the cutoff.
