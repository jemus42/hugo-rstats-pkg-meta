title: Efficiently Using Gaussian Processes with Rcpp and RcppEigen
maintainer: Giri Gopalan
description: Contains Rcpp and RcppEigen implementations of matrix operations useful
  for Gaussian process models, such as the inversion of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix,
  sampling from multivariate normal distributions, evaluation of the log-density of
  a multivariate normal vector, and Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian
  process models with elliptical slice sampling (Murray, Adams, and MacKay 2010).
