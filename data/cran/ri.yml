  ri: R package for performing randomization-based inference for
  experiments
maintainer: Cyrus Samii
description: |-
  This package provides a set of tools for conducting exact
  or approximate randomization-based inference for experiments of
  arbitrary design. The primary functionality of the package is
  in the generation, manipulation and use of permutation matrices
  implied by given experimental designs. Among other features,
  the package facilitates estimation of average treatment
  effects, constant effects variance estimation, randomization
  inference for significance testing against sharp null
  hypotheses and visualization of data and results.
