title: Solving Mixed Model Equations in R
maintainer: Giovanny Covarrubias-Pazaran
description: Structural multivariate-univariate linear mixed model solver for estimation
  of multiple random effects and unknown variance-covariance structures (i.e. heterogeneous
  and unstructured variance models) (Covarrubias-Pazaran, 2016 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0156744>;
  Maier et al., 2015 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.006>). ML/REML estimates can be obtained
  using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson and Direct-Inversion Average Information
  algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction and genome wide association studies
  (GWAS), particularly focused in the p > n problem (more coefficients than observations)
  and dense known covariance structures for levels of random effects. Spatial models
  can also be fitted using i.e. the two-dimensional spline functionality available
  in sommer.
