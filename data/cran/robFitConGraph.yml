title: Graph-Constrained Robust Covariance Estimation
maintainer: Stuart Watt
description: Contains a single function named robFitConGraph() which includes two
  algorithms for robust estimation of scatter matrices subject to zero-constraints
  in its inverse. The methodology is described in Vogel & Tyler (2014) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asu041>.
  See robFitConGraph() function documentation for further details.
