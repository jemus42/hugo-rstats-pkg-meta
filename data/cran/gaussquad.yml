title: Collection of functions for Gaussian quadrature
maintainer: Frederick Novomestky
description: A collection of functions to perform Gaussian quadrature<U+000a>with
  different weight functions corresponding to the orthogonal<U+000a>polynomials in
  package orthopolynom.  Examples verify the<U+000a>orthogonality and inner products
  of the polynomials.
