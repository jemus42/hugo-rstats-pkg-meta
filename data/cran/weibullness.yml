title: Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull Distribution (Weibullness)
maintainer: Chanseok Park
description: Performs a goodness-of-fit test of Weibull distribution (weibullness
  test) and provides the maximum likelihood estimates of the three-parameter Weibull
  distribution. Note that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation
  from the Weibull plot. For more details, see Park (2018) <doi:10.1155/2018/6056975>.
