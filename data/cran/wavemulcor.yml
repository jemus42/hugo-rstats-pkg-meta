  Wavelet Routines for Global and Local Multiple Regression and
  Correlation
maintainer: Javier Fernandez-Macho
description: |-
  Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of wavelet multiple regressions and correlations,
  and cross-regressions and cross-correlations from a multivariate time series.
  Dynamic versions of the routines allow the wavelet local multiple (cross-)regressions and
  (cross-)correlations to evolve over time.
