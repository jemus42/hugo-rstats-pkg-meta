  Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes in High-Dimensional
  Gaussian Graphical Model Structure
maintainer: Beilun Wang
description: 'This is an R implementation of Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse
  Changes in High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Model Structure (DIFFEE). The DIFFEE
  algorithm can be used to fast estimate the differential network between two related
  datasets. For instance, it can identify differential gene network from datasets
  of case and control. By performing data-driven network inference from two high-dimensional
  data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate two aggregated data blocks
  into knowledge of the changes among entities between two Gaussian Graphical Model.
  Please run demo(diffeeDemo) to learn the basic functions provided by this package.
