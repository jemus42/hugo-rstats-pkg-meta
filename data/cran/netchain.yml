  Inferring Causal Effects on Collective Outcomes under
  Interference
maintainer: Youjin Lee
description: In networks, treatments may spill over from the treated individual to
  his or her social contacts and outcomes may be contagious over time. Under this
  setting, causal inference on the collective outcome observed over all network is
  often of interest. We use chain graph models approximating the projection of the
  full longitudinal data onto the observed data to identify the causal effect of the
  intervention on the whole outcome. Justification of such approximation is demonstrated
  in Ogburn et al. (2018) <arXiv:1812.04990>.
