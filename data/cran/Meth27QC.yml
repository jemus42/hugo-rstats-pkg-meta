maintainer: Ling Teng
description: |-
  Meth27QC is a tool for analyzing Illumina Infinium
  HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Data and generating QC reports.
  This package allows users quickly assess data quality of the
  Assay. Users can evaluate the data quality in the way that
  Illumina GenomeStudio/BeadStudio recommended based on the
  control probes. The package reads files exported from
  GenomeStudio/BeadStudio software, generating intensity and
  standard deviation plots grouped by the types of the control
  probes. Meth27 carries 40 control probes for staining,
  hybridization, target removal, extension, bisulfite conversion,
  specificity, negative and non-polymorphic controls. Details of
  those control probes can be found in the Infinium Assay for
  Methylation Protocol Guide from Illumina.We also used the other
  non-control probes to plot intensity of detected genes, signal
  average for green and red. Outliers can be identified.
