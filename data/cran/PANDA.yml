  Preferential Attachment Based Common Neighbor Distribution
  Derived Functional Associations
maintainer: Hua Li
description: 'PANDA (Preferential Attachment based common Neighbor Distribution derived
  Associations) is designed to perform the following tasks in PPI networks: (1) identify
  significantly functionally associated protein pairs, (2) predict GO terms and KEGG
  pathways for proteins, (3) make a cluster of proteins based on the significant protein
  pairs, (4) identify subclusters whose members are enriched in KEGG pathways. For
  other types of biological networks, (1) and (3) can still be performed.'
