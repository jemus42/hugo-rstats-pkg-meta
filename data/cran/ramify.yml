title: Additional Matrix Functionality
maintainer: Brandon Greenwell
description: |-
  Additional matrix functionality for R including: (1) wrappers for
  the base matrix function that allow matrices to be created from character
  strings and lists (the former is especially useful for creating block
  matrices), (2) better printing of large matrices via the generic "pretty"
  print function, and (3) a number of convenience functions for users more
  familiar with other scientific languages like 'Julia', 'Matlab'/'Octave', or
  'Python'+'NumPy'.
