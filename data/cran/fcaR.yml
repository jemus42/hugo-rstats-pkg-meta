title: Formal Concept Analysis
maintainer: Domingo Lopez Rodriguez
description: |-
  Provides tools to perform fuzzy formal concept analysis, presented in Wille (1982) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01815-2_23> and in Ganter and Obiedkov (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-662-49291-8>.
  It provides functions to load and save a formal context, extract its concept lattice and implications.
  In addition, one can use the implications to compute semantic closures of fuzzy sets and, thus, build recommendation systems.
