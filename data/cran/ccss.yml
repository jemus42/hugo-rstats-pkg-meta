title: Cluster Circular Systematic Sampling
maintainer: Abhibhav Sharma
description: Draws systematic samples from a population that follows linear trend.
  The function returns a matrix comprising of the required samples as its column vectors.
  The samples produced are highly efficient and the inter sampling variance is minimum.
  The scheme will be useful in various field like Bioinformatics where the samples
  are expensive and must be precise in reflecting the population by possessing least
  sampling variance.
