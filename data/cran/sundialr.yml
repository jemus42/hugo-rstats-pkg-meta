  An Interface to 'SUNDIALS' Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
  Solvers
maintainer: Satyaprakash Nayak
description: Provides a way to call the functions in 'SUNDIALS' C ODE solving library
  (<https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials>). Currently the serial version
  of ODE solver, 'CVODE' and sensitivity calculator 'CVODES' from the 'SUNDIALS' library
  are implemented. The package requires ODE to be written as an 'R' or 'Rcpp' function
  and does not require the 'SUNDIALS' library to be installed on the local machine.
