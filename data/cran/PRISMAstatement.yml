title: Plot Flow Charts According to the "PRISMA" Statement
maintainer: Jack O. Wasey
description: |-
  Plot a PRISMA <http://prisma-statement.org/> flow
  chart describing the identification, screening, eligibility and
  inclusion or studies in systematic reviews. The PRISMA statement
  defines an evidence-based, minimal set of items for reporting in
  systematic reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA should be used for the
  reporting of studies evaluating randomized clinical trials (RCT), and
  is also for reporting on systematic reviews of other types of
  research. There is also a function to generate flow charts describing
  exclusions and inclusions for any kind of study.
