maintainer: Boris P Hejblum
description: |-
  Given the hypothesis of a bi-modal distribution of cells for
  each marker, the algorithm constructs a binary tree, the nodes of which are
  subpopulations of cells. At each node, observed cells and markers are modeled
  by both a family of normal distributions and a family of bi-modal normal mixture
  distributions. Splitting is done according to a normalized difference of AIC
  between the two families. Method is detailed in: Commenges, Alkhassim, Gottardo,
  Hejblum & Thiebaut (2018) <doi: 10.1002/cyto.a.23601>.
