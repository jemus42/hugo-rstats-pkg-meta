title: Bayesian Trophic Position Calculation with Stable Isotopes
maintainer: Claudio Quezada-Romegialli
description: |-
  Estimates the trophic position of a consumer relative
  to a baseline species. It implements a Bayesian approach which combines an
  interface to the 'JAGS' MCMC library of 'rjags' and stable isotopes. Users are
  encouraged to test the package and send bugs and/or errors to
  trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com.
