title: Robust Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using Mixtures
maintainer: Ken Beath
description: Robust generalized linear models (GLM) using a mixture method, as described
  in Beath (2018) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2017.1414164>. This assumes that the data
  are a mixture of standard observations, being a generalised linear model, and outlier
  observations from an overdispersed generalized linear model. The overdispersed linear
  model is obtained by including a normally distributed random effect in the linear
  predictor of the generalized linear model.
