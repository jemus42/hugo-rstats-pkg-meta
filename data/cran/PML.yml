  Using Actigraphy
maintainer: Xinyue Li
description: 'Penalized Multi-Band Learning algorithm can be effectively implemented
  for circadian rhythm analysis and daily activity pattern characterization using
  actigraphy (continuously measured objective physical activity data). Functions for
  interactive visualization of actigraph data are also included. Method reference:
