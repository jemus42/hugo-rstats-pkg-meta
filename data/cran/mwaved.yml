  Multichannel Wavelet Deconvolution with Additive Long Memory
  Noise
maintainer: Justin Rory Wishart
description: |-
  Computes the Wavelet deconvolution estimate of a common signal
  present in multiple channels that have possible different levels of blur
  and long memory additive error, see Kulik, Sapatinas and Wishart (2015), <doi:10.1016/j.acha.2014.04.004>.
