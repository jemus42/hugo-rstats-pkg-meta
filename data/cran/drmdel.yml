description: Dual empirical likelihood (DEL) inference under semiparametric density
  ratio models (DRM) in the presence of multiple samples, including population cumulative
  distribution function estimation, quantile estimation and comparison, density estimation,
  composite hypothesis testing for DRM parameters which encompasses testing for changes
  in population distribution functions as a special case, etc.
