title: Distribution Utilities
maintainer: David Scott
description: |-
  Utilities are provided which are of use in the
  packages I have developed for dealing with
  distributions. Currently these packages are GeneralizedHyperbolic,
  VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic and NormalLaplace. Each of these
  packages requires DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample
  skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots, moments by
  integration, changing the point about which a moment is
  calculated, functions for testing distributions using inversion
  tests and the Massart inequality. Also includes an implementation
  of the incomplete Bessel K function.
