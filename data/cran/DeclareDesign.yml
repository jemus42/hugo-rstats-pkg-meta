title: Declare and Diagnose Research Designs
maintainer: Graeme Blair
description: |-
  Researchers can characterize and learn about the properties of
  research designs before implementation using `DeclareDesign`. Ex ante
  declaration and diagnosis of designs can help researchers clarify the
  strengths and limitations of their designs and to improve their
  properties, and can help readers evaluate a research strategy prior
  to implementation and without access to results. It can also make it
  easier for designs to be shared, replicated, and critiqued.
