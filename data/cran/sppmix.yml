title: Modeling Spatial Poisson and Related Point Processes
maintainer: Sakis Micheas
description: Implements classes and methods for modeling spatial point patterns using
  inhomogeneous Poisson point processes, where the intensity surface is assumed to
  be analogous to a finite additive mixture of normal components and the number of
  components is a finite, fixed or random integer. Extensions to the marked inhomogeneous
  Poisson point processes case are also presented. We provide an extensive suite of
  R functions that can be used to simulate, visualize and model point patterns, estimate
  the parameters of the models, assess convergence of the algorithms and perform model
  selection and checking in the proposed modeling context.
