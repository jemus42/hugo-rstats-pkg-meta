title: Package for Community Ecology and Suitability Analysis
maintainer: Roeland Kindt
description: Graphical User Interface (via the R-Commander) and utility functions
  (often based on the vegan package) for statistical analysis of biodiversity and
  ecological communities, including species accumulation curves, diversity indices,
  Renyi profiles, GLMs for analysis of species abundance and presence-absence, distance
  matrices, Mantel tests, and cluster, constrained and unconstrained ordination analysis.
  A book on biodiversity and community ecology analysis is available for free download
  from the website. In 2012, methods for (ensemble) suitability modelling and mapping
  were expanded in the package.
