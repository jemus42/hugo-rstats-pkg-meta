description: |-
  Pricing of variable annuity life insurance
  contracts by means of Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo is used to price
  the contract in case the policyholder cannot surrender while
  Least Squares Monte Carlo is used if the insured can surrender.
  This package implements the pricing framework and algorithm described in
  Bacinello et al. (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2011.05.003>.
  It also implements the state-dependent fee structure
  discussed in Bernard et al. (2014) <doi:10.1017/asb.2014.13> as well as
  a function which prices the contract by resolving the partial differential equation
  described in MacKay et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/jori.12094>.
