title: R Graphics Output in LaTeX Format
maintainer: Ralf Stubner
description: |-
  Provides a graphics output device for R that records plots
  in a LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms plotting
  commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When
  included in a LaTeX document, these blocks are interpreted with
  the help of 'TikZ'---a graphics package for TeX and friends
  written by Till Tantau. Using the 'tikzDevice', the text of R
  plots can contain LaTeX commands such as mathematical formula.
  The device also allows arbitrary LaTeX code to be inserted into
  the output stream.
