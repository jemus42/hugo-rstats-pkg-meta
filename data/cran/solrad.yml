  Location, Time and Topographical Conditions
maintainer: Bijan Seyednasrollah
description: 'For surface energy models and estimation of solar positions and components
  with varying topography, time and locations. The functions calculate solar top-of-atmosphere,
  open, diffuse and direct components, atmospheric transmittance and diffuse factors,
  day length, sunrise and sunset, solar azimuth, zenith, altitude, incidence, and
  hour angles, earth declination angle, equation of time, and solar constant. Details
  about the methods and equations are explained in Seyednasrollah, Bijan, Mukesh Kumar,
  and Timothy E. Link. ''On the role of vegetation density on net snow cover radiation
  at the forest floor.'' Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 118.15 (2013):
  8359-8374, <doi:10.1002/jgrd.50575>.'
