  Functions and Datasets to Accompany Hollander, Wolfe, and
  Chicken - Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Third Edition
maintainer: Grant Schneider
description: Designed to replace the tables which were in the back of the first two
  editions of Hollander and Wolfe - Nonparametric Statistical Methods.  Exact procedures
  are performed when computationally possible.  Monte Carlo and Asymptotic procedures
  are performed otherwise.  For those procedures included in the base packages, our
  code simply provides a wrapper to standardize the output with the other procedures
  in the package.
