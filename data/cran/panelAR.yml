  Estimation of Linear AR(1) Panel Data Models with
  Cross-Sectional Heteroskedasticity and/or Correlation
maintainer: Konstantin Kashin
description: The package estimates linear models on panel data structures in the presence
  of AR(1)-type autocorrelation as well as panel heteroskedasticity and/or contemporaneous
  correlation. First, AR(1)-type autocorrelation is addressed via a two-step Prais-Winsten
  feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) procedure, where the autocorrelation coefficients
  may be panel-specific. A number of common estimators for the autocorrelation coefficient
  are supported. In case of panel heteroskedasticty, one can choose to use a sandwich-type
  robust standard error estimator with OLS or a panel weighted least squares estimator
  after the two-step Prais-Winsten estimator. Alternatively, if panels are both heteroskedastic
  and contemporaneously correlated, the package supports panel-corrected standard
  errors (PCSEs) as well as the Parks-Kmenta FGLS estimator.
