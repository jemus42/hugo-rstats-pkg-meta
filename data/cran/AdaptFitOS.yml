  Adaptive Semiparametric Additive Regression with Simultaneous
  Confidence Bands and Specification Tests
maintainer: Manuel Wiesenfarth
description: Fits semiparametric additive regression models with spatially adaptive
  penalized splines and computes simultaneous confidence bands and associated specification
  (lack-of-fit) tests. Simultaneous confidence bands cover the entire curve with a
  prescribed level of confidence and allow us to assess the estimation uncertainty
  for the whole curve. In contrast to pointwise confidence bands, they permit statements
  about the statistical significance of certain features (e.g. bumps) in the underlying
  curve.The method allows for handling of spatially heterogeneous functions and their
  derivatives as well as heteroscedasticity in the data. See Wiesenfarth et al (2012)
