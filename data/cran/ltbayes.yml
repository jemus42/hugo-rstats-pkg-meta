  Simulation-Based Bayesian Inference for Latent Traits of Item
  Response Models
maintainer: Timothy R. Johnson
description: |-
  Functions for simulating realizations from the posterior distribution of
  a latent trait of an item response model. Distributions are conditional on one or
  a subset of response patterns (e.g., sum scores). Functions for computing likelihoods,
  Fisher and observed information, posterior modes, and profile likelihood confidence
  intervals are also included. These functions are designed to be easily amenable to
  user-specified models.
