title: Statistical Tests for Cryptographic Randomness
maintainer: Haydar Demirhan
description: |-
  Performs cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random
  integers or bits. Included tests are greatest common divisor, birthday spacings,
  book stack, adaptive chi-square, topological binary, and three random walk
  tests. Tests except greatest common divisor and birthday spacings are not
  covered by standard test suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit
  test, results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-Bera tests are
  also generated by some of the cryptographic randomness tests.
