description: 'Different high-level graphics functions for displaying large datasets,
  displaying circular data in a very flexible way, finding local maxima, brewing color
  ramps, drawing nice arrows, zooming 2D-plots, creating figures with differently
  colored margin and plot region.  In addition, the package contains auxiliary functions
  for data manipulation like omitting observations with irregular values or selecting
  data by logical vectors, which include NAs. Other functions are especially useful
  in spectroscopy and analyses of environmental data: robust baseline fitting, finding
  peaks in spectra, converting humidity measures.'
