title: Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer
maintainer: Héctor Manuel Sánchez Castellanos
description: |-
  Provides a model designed to be a reliable testbed where various gene
  drive interventions for mosquito-borne diseases control. It is being developed to
  accommodate the use of various mosquito-specific gene drive systems within a
  population dynamics framework that allows migration of individuals between patches
  in landscape. Previous work developing the population dynamics can be found in Deredec et al.
  (2001) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1110717108> and Hancock & Godfray (2007) <doi:10.1186/1475-2875-6-98>,
  and extensions to accommodate basic CRISPR homing dynamics in Marshall et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1038/s41598-017-02744-7>.
