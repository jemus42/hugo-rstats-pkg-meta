title: Plotting for Bayesian Models
maintainer: Jonah Gabry
description: |-
  Plotting functions for posterior analysis, MCMC diagnostics,
  prior and posterior predictive checks, and other visualizations
  to support the applied Bayesian workflow advocated in
  Gabry, Simpson, Vehtari, Betancourt, and Gelman (2019) <doi:10.1111/rssa.12378>.
  The package is designed not only to provide convenient functionality
  for users, but also a common set of functions that can be easily used by
  developers working on a variety of R packages for Bayesian modeling,
  particularly (but not exclusively) packages interfacing with 'Stan'.
