version: 0.9.3
title: Data Mining and R Programming for Beginners
maintainer: Alexandre Blansché
description: 'Contains functions to simplify the use of data mining methods (classification,
  regression, clustering, etc.), for students and beginners in R programming. Various
  R packages are used and wrappers are built around the main functions, to standardize
  the use of data mining methods (input/output): it brings a certain loss of flexibility,
  but also a gain of simplicity. The package name came from the French "Fouille de
  Données en Master 2 Informatique Décisionnelle".'
