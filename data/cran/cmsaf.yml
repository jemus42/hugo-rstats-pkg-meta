description: |-
  The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF)
  is a ground segment of the European Organization for the Exploitation of
  Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs Satellite Application
  Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the sustainable monitoring of the climate
  system by providing essential climate variables related to the energy and water
  cycle of the atmosphere (<http://www.cmsaf.eu>). It is a joint cooperation of eight
  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services.
  The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a collection of R-operators for the analysis and
  manipulation of CM SAF NetCDF formatted data. The 'cmsaf' R-package is tested
  for CM SAF NetCDF data. Other CF conform NetCDF data should be applicable, but there
  is no guarantee for an error-free application.
  The 'cmsaf' R-package includes a 'shiny' based interface for an easy application of
  the 'cmsaf' package operators and the preparation and visualization of CM SAF NetCDF
  data. CM SAF climate data records are provided for free via (<https://wui.cmsaf.eu>).
  Detailed information and test data are provided on the CM SAF webpage
  (<http://www.cmsaf.eu/R_toolbox>).
