title: Tools for Storing, Restoring and Searching for R Objects
maintainer: Przemyslaw Biecek
description: |-
  Data exploration and modelling is a process in which a lot of data
  artifacts are produced. Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots,
  statistical models, different versions of data sets and different versions
  of results. The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced
  and the harder it is to manage these artifacts. Archivist helps to store
  and manage artifacts created in R. Archivist allows you to store selected
  artifacts as a binary files together with their metadata and relations.
  Archivist allows to share artifacts with others, either through shared
  folder or github. Archivist allows to look for already created artifacts by
  using it's class, name, date of the creation or other properties. Makes it
  easy to restore such artifacts. Archivist allows to check if new artifact
  is the exact copy that was produced some time ago. That might be useful
  either for testing or caching.
