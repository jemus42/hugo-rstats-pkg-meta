  Planning and Analysing Survival Studies under Non-Proportional
  Hazards
maintainer: Robin Ristl
description: |-
  Piecewise constant hazard functions are used to flexibly model survival distributions with non-proportional hazards and
  to simulate data from the specified distributions. Also, a function to calculate weighted log-rank tests for the
  comparison of two hazard functions is included. Finally, a function to calculate a test using the maximum of a set of
  test statistics from weighted log-rank tests is provided. This test utilizes the asymptotic multivariate normal joint distribution
  of the separate test statistics. The correlation is estimated from the data.
