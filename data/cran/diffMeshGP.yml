title: Multi-Fidelity Computer Experiments Using the Tuo-Wu-Yu Model
maintainer: Wenjia Wang
description: This R function implements the nonstationary Kriging model proposed by
  Tuo, Wu and Yu (2014) <DOI:10.1080/00401706.2013.842935> for analyzing multi-fidelity
  computer outputs. This function computes the maximum likelihood estimates for the
  model parameters as well as the predictive means and variances of the exact solution
  (i.e., the conceptually highest fidelity).
