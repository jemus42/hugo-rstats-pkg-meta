title: C-statistics for risk prediction models with censored survival<U+000a>data
maintainer: Hajime Uno
description: Performs inference for C of risk prediction models with<U+000a>censored
  survival data, using the method proposed by Uno et al.<U+000a>(2011). Inference
  for the difference in C between two competing<U+000a>prediction models is also implemented.
