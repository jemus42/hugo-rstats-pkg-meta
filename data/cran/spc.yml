  Control Chart Performance Measures
maintainer: Sven Knoth
description: |-
  Evaluation of control charts by means of
  the zero-state, steady-state ARL (Average Run Length) and RL quantiles.
  Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL. The control charts
  under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA, CUSUM, and
  Shiryaev-Roberts schemes for monitoring the mean or variance of normally
  distributed independent data. ARL calculation of the same set of schemes under drift (in the mean) are added.
  Eventually, all ARL measures for the multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) are provided.
