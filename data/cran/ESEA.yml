  ESEA: Discovering the Dysregulated Pathways based on Edge Set
  Enrichment Analysis
maintainer: Xinrui Shi
description: The package can identify the dysregulated canonical pathways by investigating
  the changes of biological relationships of pathways in the context of gene expression
  data. (1) The ESEA package constructs a background set of edges by extracting pathway
  structure (e.g. interaction, regulation, modification, and binding etc.) from the
  seven public databases (KEGG; Reactome; Biocarta; NCI; SPIKE; HumanCyc; Panther)
  and the edge sets of pathways for each of the above databases. (2) The ESEA package
  can can quantify the change of correlation between genes for each edge based on
  gene expression data with cases and controls. (3) The ESEA package uses the weighted
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to calculate an edge enrichment score (EES), which
  reflects the degree to which a given pathway is associated the specific phenotype.
  (4) The ESEA package can provide the visualization of the results.
