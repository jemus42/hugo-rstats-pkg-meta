  Robust Coefficient Alpha and Omega with Missing and Non-Normal
  Data
maintainer: Zhiyong Zhang
description: Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega are widely used reliability or
  internal consistency measures in social, behavioral and education sciences. Alpha
  is reported in nearly every study that involves measuring a construct through multiple
  test items. The package 'coefficientalpha' calculates coefficient alpha and coefficient
  omega with missing data and non-normal data. Robust standard errors and confidence
  intervals are also provided. A test is also available to test the tau-equivalent
  and homogeneous assumptions. Since Version 0.5, the bootstrap confidence intervals
  were added.
