version: '1.1'
title: Permutation of Species During Turnover Events
maintainer: Kenneth B. Hoehn
description: 'Provides a robust framework for analyzing the extent to which differential
  survival with respect to higher level trait variation is reducible to lower level
  variation. In addition to its primary test, it also provides functions for simulation-based
  power analysis, reading in common data set formats, and visualizing results. Temporarily
  contains an edited version of function hr.mcp() from package ''wild1'', written
  by Glen Sargeant. For tutorial see: http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Evolve/Perspectev.html.'
