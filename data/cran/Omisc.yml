title: Univariate Bootstrapping and Other Things
maintainer: Patrick O'Keefe
description: 'Primarily devoted to implementing the Univariate Bootstrap (as well
  as the Traditional Bootstrap). In addition there are multiple functions for DeFries-Fulker
  behavioral genetics models. The univariate bootstrapping functions, DeFries-Fulker
  functions, regression and traditional bootstrapping functions form the original
  core. Additional features may come online later, however this software is a work
  in progress. For more information about univariate bootstrapping see: Lee and Rodgers
  (1998) and Beasley et al (2007) <doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.12.4.414>.'
