description: Buckley-James regression for right-censoring survival data with high-dimensional
  covariates. Implementations for survival data include boosting with componentwise
  linear least squares, componentwise smoothing splines, regression trees and MARS.
  Other high-dimensional tools include penalized regression for survival data. See
