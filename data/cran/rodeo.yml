version: 0.7.5
title: A Code Generator for ODE-Based Models
maintainer: David Kneis
description: |-
  Provides an R6 class and several utility methods to
  facilitate the implementation of models based on ordinary
  differential equations. The heart of the package is a code generator
  that creates compiled 'Fortran' (or 'R') code which can be passed to
  a numerical solver. There is direct support for solvers contained
  in packages 'deSolve' and 'rootSolve'.
