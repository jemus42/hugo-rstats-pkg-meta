title: Data Class and Tools for Handling Spatial-Temporal Data
maintainer: Jan Philipp Dietrich
description: |-
  Data class for increased interoperability working with spatial-
  temporal data together with corresponding functions and methods (conversions,
  basic calculations and basic data manipulation). The class distinguishes
  between spatial, temporal and other dimensions to facilitate the development
  and interoperability of tools build for it. Additional features are name-based
  addressing of data and internal consistency checks (e.g. checking for the right
  data order in calculations).
