  Online Unsupervised Outlier Detection Using Finite Mixtures with
  Discounting Learning Algorithms
maintainer: Lizhen Nie
description: Addressing the problem of outlier detection from the viewpoint of statistical
  learning theory. This method is proposed by Yamanishi, K., Takeuchi, J., Williams,
  G. et al. (2004) <DOI:10.1023/B:DAMI.0000023676.72185.7c>. It learns the probabilistic
  model (using a finite mixture model) through an on-line unsupervised process. After
  each datum is input, a score will be given with a high one indicating a high possibility
  of being a statistical outlier.
