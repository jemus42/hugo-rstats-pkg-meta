title: Random Network Model Selection and Parameter Tuning
maintainer: Tianxi Li
description: Model selection and parameter tuning procedures for a class of random
  network models. The model selection can be done by a general cross-validation framework
  called ECV from Li et. al. (2016) <arXiv:1612.04717> . Several other model-based
  and task-specific methods are also included, such as NCV from Chen and Lei (2016)
  <arXiv:1411.1715>, likelihood ratio method from Wang and Bickel (2015) <arXiv:1502.02069>,
  spectral methods from Le and Levina (2015) <arXiv:1507.00827>. Many network analysis
  methods are also implemented, such as the regularized spectral clustering (Amini
  et. al. 2013 <doi:10.1214/13-AOS1138>) and its degree corrected version and graphon
  neighborhood smoothing (Zhang et. al. 2015 <arXiv:1509.08588>).
