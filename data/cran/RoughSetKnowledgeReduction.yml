title: Simplification of Decision Tables using Rough Sets
maintainer: Alber Sanchez
description: 'Rough Sets were introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak on his book "Rough Sets:
  Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning About Data". Rough Sets provide a formal method
  to approximate crisp sets when the set-element belonging relationship is either
  known or undetermined. This enables the use of Rough Sets for reasoning about incomplete
  or contradictory knowledge. A decision table is a prescription of the decisions
  to make given some conditions. Such decision tables can be reduced without losing
  prescription ability. This package provides the classes and methods for knowledge
  reduction from decision tables as presented in the chapter 7 of the aforementioned
  book. This package provides functions for calculating the both the discernibility
  matrix and the essential parts of decision tables.'
