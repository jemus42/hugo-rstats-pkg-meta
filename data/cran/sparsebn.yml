title: Learning Sparse Bayesian Networks from High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Bryon Aragam
description: Fast methods for learning sparse Bayesian networks from high-dimensional
  data using sparse regularization, as described in Aragam, Gu, and Zhou (2017) <arXiv:1703.04025>.
  Designed to handle mixed experimental and observational data with thousands of variables
  with either continuous or discrete observations.
