title: Photobiological Calculations
maintainer: Pedro J. Aphalo
description: |-
  Definitions of classes, methods, operators and functions for use
  in photobiology and radiation meteorology and climatology. Calculation of
  effective (weighted) and not-weighted irradiances/doses, fluence rates,
  transmittance, reflectance, absorptance, absorbance and diverse ratios and
  other derived quantities from spectral data. Local maxima and minima: peaks,
  valleys and spikes. Conversion between energy-and photon-based units.
  Wavelength interpolation. Astronomical calculations related solar angles and
  day length. Colours and vision. This package is part of the 'r4photobiology'
  suite, Aphalo, P. J. (2015) <doi:10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14>.
