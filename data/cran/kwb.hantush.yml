description: |-
  Calculation groundwater mounding beneath an
  infiltration basin based on the Hantush (1967) equation
  (<doi:10.1029/WR003i001p00227>). The correct implementation is shown
  with a verification example based on a USGS report (page 25,
  <https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5102/support/sir2010-5102.pdf#page=35>).
