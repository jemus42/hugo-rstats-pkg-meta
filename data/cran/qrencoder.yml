title: Quick Response Code (QR Code) / Matrix Barcode Creator
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  Quick Response codes (QR codes) are a type of matrix bar code and can be
  used to authenticate transactions, provide access to multi-factor authentication
  services and enable general data transfer in an image. QR codes use four standardized
  encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently store
  data. Matrix barcode generation is performed efficiently in C via the included
  'libqrencoder' library created by Kentaro Fukuchi.
