title: Empirical Distribution Ordering Inference Framework (EDOIF)
maintainer: Chainarong Amornbunchornvej
description: A non-parametric framework based on  estimation statistics principle.
  Its main purpose is to  infer orders of empirical distributions from different categories
  based on a probability of finding a value in one distribution that is greater than
  an expectation of another distribution. Given a set of ordered-pair of real-category
  values the framework is capable of 1) inferring orders of  domination  of  categories  and  representing  orders  in  the
  form of a graph; 2) estimating  magnitude  of  difference  between  a  pair  of
  categories in forms of mean-difference confidence intervals; and 3) visualizing  domination  orders  and  magnitudes  of  difference
  of categories. The publication of this package is at Chainarong Amornbunchornvej,
