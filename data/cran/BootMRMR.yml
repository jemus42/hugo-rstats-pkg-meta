title: Bootstrap-MRMR Technique for Informative Gene Selection
maintainer: Samarendra Das
description: Selection of informative features like genes, transcripts, RNA seq, etc.
  using Bootstrap Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy technique from a given
  high dimensional genomic dataset. Informative gene selection involves identification
  of relevant genes and removal of redundant genes as much as possible from a large
  gene space. Main applications in high-dimensional expression data analysis (e.g.
  microarray data, NGS expression data and other genomics and proteomics applications).
