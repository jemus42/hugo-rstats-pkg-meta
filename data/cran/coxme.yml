title: Mixed Effects Cox Models
maintainer: Terry M. Therneau
description: |-
  Fit Cox proportional hazards models containing both
  fixed and random effects.  The random effects can have a general form, of which
  familial interactions (a "kinship" matrix) is a particular special case.
  Note that the simplest case of a mixed effects Cox model, i.e. a single random
  per-group intercept, is also called a "frailty" model.  The approach is based
  on Ripatti and Palmgren, Biometrics 2002.
