  Batching Routines in Parallel and Passing Command-Line Arguments
  to R
maintainer: Thomas Hoffmann
description: Functions to allow you to easily pass command-line arguments into R,
  and functions to aid in submitting your R code in parallel on a cluster and joining
  the results afterward (e.g. multiple parameter values for simulations running in
  parallel, splitting up a permutation test in parallel, etc.). See `parseCommandArgs(...)'
  for the main example of how to use this package.
