  Bridging the Gap Between Qualitative Data and Quantitative
  Analysis
maintainer: Tyler Rinker
description: |-
  Automates many of the tasks associated with quantitative discourse analysis of transcripts containing discourse
  including frequency counts of sentence types, words, sentences, turns of talk, syllables and other assorted
  analysis tasks. The package provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data. Many functions enable the user
  to aggregate data by any number of grouping variables, providing analysis and seamless integration with other R
  packages that undertake higher level analysis and visualization of text. This affords the user a more efficient
  and targeted analysis. 'qdap' is designed for transcript analysis, however, many functions are applicable to other
  areas of Text Mining/ Natural Language Processing.
