title: Lightweight Well-Known Geometry Parsing
maintainer: Dewey Dunnington
description: |-
  Provides a minimal R and C++ API for parsing
  well-known binary and well-known text representation of
  geometries to and from R-native formats.
  Well-known binary is compact
  and fast to parse; well-known text is human-readable
  and is useful for writing tests. These formats are only
  useful in R if the information they contain can be
  accessed in R, for which high-performance functions
  are provided here.
