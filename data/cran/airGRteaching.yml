  Teaching Hydrological Modelling with the GR Rainfall-Runoff
  Models ('Shiny' Interface Included)
maintainer: Olivier Delaigue
description: Add-on package to the 'airGR' package that simplifies its use and is
  aimed at being used for teaching hydrology. The package provides 1) three functions
  that allow to complete very simply a hydrological modelling exercise 2) plotting
  functions to help students to explore observed data and to interpret the results
  of calibration and simulation of the GR ('GÃ©nie rural') models 3) a 'Shiny' graphical
  interface that allows for displaying the impact of model parameters on hydrographs
  and models internal variables.
