  Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Next-Generation
  Sequencing Data
maintainer: Hao Chen
description: This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number Profiling using
  Next-Generation Sequencing.  Given the allele-specific coverage at the variant loci,
  this program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy
  number.  It requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in a pair
  of case and control samples. For detection of somatic mutations, the case and control
  samples can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.
