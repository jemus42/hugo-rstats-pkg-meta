title: Robust Estimation for Generalized Additive Models
maintainer: Raymond K. W. Wong
description: |-
  This package provides robust estimation for generalized
  additive models. It implements a fast and stable algorithm in
  Wong, Yao and Lee (2013). The implementation also contains
  three automatic selection methods for smoothing parameter. They
  are designed to be robust to outliers. For more details, see
  Wong, Yao and Lee (2013).
