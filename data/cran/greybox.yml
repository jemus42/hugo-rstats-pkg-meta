title: Toolbox for Model Building and Forecasting
maintainer: Ivan Svetunkov
description: |-
  Implements functions and instruments for regression model building and its
  application to forecasting. The main scope of the package is in variables selection
  and models specification for cases of time series data. This includes promotional
  modelling, selection between different dynamic regressions with non-standard
  distributions of errors, selection based on cross validation, solutions to the fat
  regression model problem and more. Models developed in the package are tailored
  specifically for forecasting purposes. So as a results there are several methods
  that allow producing forecasts from these models and visualising them.
