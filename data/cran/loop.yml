  loop decomposition of weighted directed graphs for life cycle
  analysis, providing flexbile network plotting methods, and
  analyzing food chain properties in ecology
maintainer: Youhua Chen
description: |-
  The program can perform loop analysis and plot network
  structure (especially for food webs),including minimum spanning
  tree, loop decomposition of weighted directed graphs, and other
  network properties which may be related to food chain
  properties in ecology.
