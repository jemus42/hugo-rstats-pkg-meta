  Variable Life Adjusted Display and Other Risk-Adjusted Quality
  Control Charts
maintainer: Philipp Wittenberg
description: |-
  Contains functions to set up risk-adjusted quality control charts
  in health care. For the variable life adjusted display (VLAD) proposed by
  Lovegrove et al. (1997) <doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(97)06507-0> signaling rules
  derived in Wittenberg et al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7647> are implemented.
  Additionally, for the risk-adjusted cumulative sum chart based on log-likelihood
  ratio statistic introduced by Steiner et al. (2000) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.441>
  average run length and control limits can be computed.
