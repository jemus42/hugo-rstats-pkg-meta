title: Convolution-Based Nonstationary Spatial Modeling
maintainer: Mark D. Risser
description: |-
  Fits convolution-based nonstationary
  Gaussian process models to point-referenced spatial data. The nonstationary
  covariance function allows the user to specify the underlying correlation
  structure and which spatial dependence parameters should be allowed to
  vary over space: the anisotropy, nugget variance, and process variance.
  The parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood, using a local
  likelihood approach. Also provided are functions to fit stationary spatial
  models for comparison, calculate the Kriging predictor and standard errors,
  and create various plots to visualize nonstationarity.
