title: Analysis and Graphics for Unreplicated Experiments
maintainer: Russell Lenth
description: |-
  Provides half-normal plots, reference plots, and Pareto plots
  of effects from an unreplicated experiment, along with various
  pseudo-standard-error measures, simulated reference distributions,
  and other tools. Many of these methods are described in
  Daniel C. (1959) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1959.10489866> and/or
  Lenth R.V. (1989) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1989.10488595>, but some new
  approaches are added and integrated in one package.
