  Create Badges for 'Travis', 'Repostatus' 'Codecov.io' Etc in
  Github Readme
maintainer: Roel M. Hogervorst
description: |-
  Tired of copy and pasting almost identical markdown for badges in
  every new R-package that you create, on Github or other code-sharing sites?
  This package allows you to easily paste badges. If you want to, it will also search
  your DESCRIPTION file and extract the package name,
  license, R-version, and current projectversion and transform that into
  badges. It will also search for a ".travis.yml" file and create a "Travis"" badge,
  if you use "Codecov.io" to check your code coverage after a "Travis" build
  this package will also build a "Codecov.io"-badge. All the badges can be placed
  individually or can be placed below the top "YAML"" content of your "RMarkdown
  file" (Readme.Rmd) or "README.md" file.
  Currently creates badges for  Projectstatus ("Repostatus.org"), license
  Travis Build Status, Codecov, Minimal R version, CRAN status, CRAN downloads,
  Github stars and forks, Package rank, rdocumentation,
  current version of your package and last change of "README.Rmd".
