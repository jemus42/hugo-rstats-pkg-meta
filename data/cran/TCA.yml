title: Tensor Composition Analysis
maintainer: Elior Rahmani
description: Tensor Composition Analysis (TCA) allows the deconvolution of two-dimensional
  data (features by observations) coming from a mixture of sources into a three-dimensional
  matrix of signals (features by observations by sources). TCA further allows to test
  the features in the data for different statistical relations with an outcome of
  interest while modeling source-specific effects (TCA regression); particularly,
  it allows to look for statistical relations between source-specific signals and
  an outcome. For example, TCA can deconvolve bulk tissue-level DNA methylation data
  (methylation sites by individuals) into a tensor of cell-type-specific methylation
  levels for each individual (methylation sites by individuals by cell types) and
  it allows to detect cell-type-specific relations (associations) with an outcome
  of interest. For more details see Rahmani et al. (2018) <DOI:10.1101/437368>.
