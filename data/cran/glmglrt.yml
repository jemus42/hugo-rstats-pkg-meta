title: GLRT P-Values in Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Andr√© GILLIBERT
description: |-
  Provides functions to compute Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests (GLRT) and Rao's score tests of simple
  and complex contrasts of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). It provides the same interface as summary.glm(), adding GLRT P-values,
  less biased than Wald's P-values and consistent with profile-likelihood confidence interval generated by confint().
