title: Bayesian Meta-Analysis with Publications Bias and P-Hacking
maintainer: Jonas Moss
description: |-
  Tools for Bayesian estimation of meta-analysis models that account
  for publications bias or p-hacking. For publication bias, this package
  implements a variant of the p-value based selection model of Hedges (1992)
  <doi:10.1214/ss/1177011364> with discrete selection probabilities. It also
  implements the mixture of truncated normals model for p-hacking described
  in Moss and De Bin (2019) <arXiv:1911.12445>.
