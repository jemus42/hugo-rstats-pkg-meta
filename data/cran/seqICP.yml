version: '1.1'
title: Sequential Invariant Causal Prediction
maintainer: Niklas Pfister
description: Contains an implementation of invariant causal prediction for sequential
  data. The main function in the package is 'seqICP', which performs linear sequential
  invariant causal prediction and has guaranteed type I error control. For non-linear
  dependencies the package also contains a non-linear method 'seqICPnl', which allows
  to input any regression procedure and performs tests based on a permutation approach
  that is only approximately correct. In order to test whether an individual set S
  is invariant the package contains the subroutines 'seqICP.s' and 'seqICPnl.s' corresponding
  to the respective main methods.
