  Hazard Ratio Estimation using Cox Model Weighted by the
  Estimated Propensity Score
maintainer: David Hajage
description: |-
  Estimates the log hazard ratio associated with a binary exposure using a Cox PH model weighted by the propensity score.
  Propensity model is estimated using a simple logistic regression.
  Variance estimation takes into account the propensity score estimation step with the method proposed by Hajage et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700330>.
  Both the average treatment effect on the overall (ATE) or the treated (ATT) population can be estimated.
  For the ATE estimation, both unstabilized and stabilized weights can be used.
