title: Structural Equation Multidimensional Scaling
maintainer: Patrick Mair
description: Fits a structural equation multidimensional scaling (SEMDS) model for
  asymmetric and three-way input dissimilarities. It assumes that the dissimilarities
  are measured with errors. The latent dissimilarities are estimated as factor scores
  within an SEM framework while the objects are represented in a low-dimensional space
  as in MDS.
