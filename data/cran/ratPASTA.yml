title: Processing Acoustic Startle Experimental Data
maintainer: Ivan Kodvanj
description: |-
  Used for processing data obtained from behaviour experiments studying
  acoustic startle response, a reflex to a loud sound, modulated by several
  brain regions. The input data is generated with PASTA (Platform for Acoustic
  STArtle), a DIY device made from a kitchen scale that measures the twitch of
  an animal standing on the device and records it as time-series data. The
  function of this package is to import all data, process it in accordance
  with default or custom metadata describing the experiment protocol, calculate
  measurements and visualize the results. The PASTA solution and this package
  are described in Virag et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.04.10.035766>.
