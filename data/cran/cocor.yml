maintainer: Birk Diedenhofen
description: |-
  Statistical tests for the comparison between two correlations
  based on either independent or dependent groups. Dependent correlations can
  either be overlapping or nonoverlapping. A web interface is available on the
  website http://comparingcorrelations.org. A plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard
  is included. Please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org to use this
  feature. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a
  repository, as it is a part of RKWard.
