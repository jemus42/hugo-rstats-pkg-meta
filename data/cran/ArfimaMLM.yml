title: Arfima-MLM Estimation For Repeated Cross-Sectional Data
maintainer: Patrick Kraft
description: Functions to facilitate the estimation of Arfima-MLM models for repeated
  cross-sectional data and pooled cross-sectional time-series data (see Lebo and Weber
  2015). The estimation procedure uses double filtering with Arfima methods to account
  for autocorrelation in repeated cross-sectional data followed by multilevel modeling
  (MLM) to estimate aggregate as well as individual-level parameters simultaneously.
