title: Object-Oriented Implementation of CRM Designs
maintainer: Giuseppe Palermo
description: |-
  Implements a wide range of model-based dose
  escalation designs, ranging from classical and modern continual
  reassessment methods (CRMs) based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to
  dual-endpoint designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy outcome. The
  focus is on Bayesian inference, making it very easy to setup a new design
  with its own JAGS code. However, it is also possible to implement 3+3
  designs for comparison or models with non-Bayesian estimation. The whole
  package is written in a modular form in the S4 class system, making it very
  flexible for adaptation to new models, escalation or stopping rules.
