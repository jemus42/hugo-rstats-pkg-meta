  of Zuber and Strimmer (2011) "High-dimensional regression and variable
  selection using CAR scores" SAGMB 10: 34, <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1730>.
  CAR scores measure the correlation between the response and the
  Mahalanobis-decorrelated  predictors.  The squared CAR score is a
  natural measure of variable importance and provides a canonical
  ordering of variables. This package provides functions for estimating
  CAR scores, for variable selection using CAR scores, and for estimating
  corresponding regression coefficients. Both shrinkage as well as
  empirical estimators are available.
