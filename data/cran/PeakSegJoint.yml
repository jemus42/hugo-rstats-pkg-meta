title: Joint Peak Detection in Several ChIP-Seq Samples
maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking
description: |-
  Jointly segment several ChIP-seq samples to find the peaks
  which are the same and different across samples. The fast approximate
  maximum Poisson likelihood algorithm is described in
  "PeakSegJoint: fast supervised peak detection via joint segmentation
  of multiple count data samples"
  <arXiv:1506.01286> by TD Hocking and G Bourque.
