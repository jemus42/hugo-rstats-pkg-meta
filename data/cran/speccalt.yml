title: Alternative spectral clustering, with automatic estimation of k.
maintainer: Pierrick Bruneau
description: Alternative to the kernlab::specc function. Includes a spectral clustering
  implementation, a locally adapted kernel function akin to what is already proposed
  in kernlab, and an optional procedure that automatically estimates the optimal number
  of clusters. Several sample data sets are also included.
