title: Straightforward 'NetCDF' Metadata
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Extract metadata from 'NetCDF' data sources, these can be files, file handles or
  servers. This package leverages and extends the lower level functions of the 'RNetCDF' package
  providing a consistent set of functions that all return data frames. We introduce named concepts
  of 'grid', 'axis' and 'source' which are all meaningful entities without formal definition in the
  'NetCDF' library <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>. 'RNetCDF' matches the library
  itself with only the named concepts of 'variables', 'dimensions' and 'attributes'. 'ncmeta'
  provides a required framework for the in-development 'tidync' project <https://github.com/hypertidy/tidync>.
