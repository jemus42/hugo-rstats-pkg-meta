title: Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation
maintainer: Johan Larsson
description: |-
  Efficient implementations for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation
  (SLOPE): generalized linear models regularized with the sorted L1-norm
  (Bogdan et al. (2015) <doi:10/gfgwzt>). Supported models include ordinary
  least-squares regression, binomial regression, multinomial regression, and
  Poisson regression. Both dense and sparse  predictor matrices are supported.
  In addition, the package features predictor screening rules that enable fast
  and efficient solutions to high-dimensional problems.
