title: MLE of a Truncated Normal Distribution with Censored Data
maintainer: Justin Williams
description: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters assuming an underlying
  left truncated normal distribution with left censoring described in Williams, J,
  Kim, H, and Crespi, C. (2019) <arXiv:1911.11221>. Censoring is assumed to occur
  above the truncation threshold meaning that only censored observations are observed.
  Additional maximum likelihood estimation procedures are implemented to solve left
  censored only and left truncated only problems.
