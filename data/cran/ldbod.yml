title: Local Density-Based Outlier Detection
maintainer: Kristopher Williams
description: |-
  Flexible procedures to compute local density-based outlier scores for ranking outliers.
  Both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search can be implemented, while also accommodating
  multiple neighborhood sizes and four different local density-based methods. It allows for
  referencing a random subsample of the input data or a user specified reference data set
  to compute outlier scores against, so both unsupervised and semi-supervised outlier
  detection can be implemented.
