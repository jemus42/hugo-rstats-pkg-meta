title: Normalisation of Psychometric Tests
maintainer: Cecile Proust-Lima
description: Functions for normalizing psychometric test scores. The normalization
  aims at correcting the metrological properties of the psychometric tests such as
  the ceiling and floor effects and the curvilinearity (unequal interval scaling).
  Functions to compute and plot predictions in the natural scale of the psychometric
  test from the estimates of a linear mixed model estimated on the normalized scores
  are also provided. See Philipps et al (2014) <doi:10.1159/000365637> for details.
