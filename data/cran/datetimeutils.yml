title: Utilities for Dates and Times
maintainer: Enrico Schumann
description: |-
  Utilities for handling dates and times, such
  as selecting particular days of the week or month,
  formatting timestamps as required by RSS feeds, or
  converting timestamp representations of other software
  (such as 'MATLAB' and 'Excel') to R. The package is
  lightweight (no dependencies, pure R implementations) and
  relies only on R's standard classes to represent dates
  and times ('Date' and 'POSIXt'); it aims to provide
  efficient implementations, through vectorisation and the
  use of R's native numeric representations of timestamps
  where possible.
