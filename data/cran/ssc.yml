title: Semi-Supervised Classification Methods
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: |-
  Provides a collection of self-labeled techniques for semi-supervised
  classification. In semi-supervised classification, both labeled and unlabeled
  data are used to train a classifier. This learning paradigm has obtained promising
  results, specifically in the presence of a reduced set of labeled examples.
  This package implements a collection of self-labeled techniques to construct a
  classification model. This family of techniques enlarges the original labeled set
  using the most confident predictions to classify unlabeled data. The techniques
  implemented can be applied to classification problems in several domains by the
  specification of a supervised base classifier. At low ratios of labeled data, it
  can be shown to perform better than classical supervised classifiers.
