title: Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm
maintainer: Nikolaos Kourentzes
description: Functions and wrappers for using the Multiple Aggregation Prediction
  Algorithm (MAPA) for time series forecasting. MAPA models and forecasts time series
  at multiple temporal aggregation levels, thus strengthening and attenuating the
  various time series components for better holistic estimation of its structure.
