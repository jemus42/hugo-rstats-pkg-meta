  Generating Robust Biclusters from a Bicluster Set (Ensemble
  Biclustering)
maintainer: Tatsiana Khamiakova
description: |-
  Biclusters are submatrices in the data matrix which
  satisfy certain conditions of homogeneity. Package contains
  functions for generating robust biclusters with respect to the
  initialization parameters for a given bicluster solution
  contained in a bicluster set in data, the procedure is also
  known as ensemble biclustering. The set of biclusters is
  evaluated based on the similarity of its elements (the
  overlap), and afterwards the hierarchical tree is constructed
  to obtain cut-off points for the classes of robust biclusters.
  The result is a number of robust (or super) biclusters with
  none or low overlap.
