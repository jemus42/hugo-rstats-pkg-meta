title: Easy Microarray Data Analysis
maintainer: Pierre Gestraud
description: We propose both a clear analysis strategy and a selection of tools to
  investigate microarray gene expression data. The most usual and relevant existing
  R functions were discussed, validated and gathered in an easy-to-use R package (EMA)
  devoted to gene expression microarray analysis. These functions were improved for
  ease of use, enhanced visualisation and better interpretation of results.
