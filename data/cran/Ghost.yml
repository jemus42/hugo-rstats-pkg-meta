title: Missing Data Segments Imputation in Multivariate Streams
maintainer: Siyavash Shabani
description: Helper functions provide an accurate imputation algorithm for reconstructing
  the missing segment in a multi-variate data streams. Inspired by single-shot learning,
  it reconstructs the missing segment by identifying the first similar segment in
  the stream. Nevertheless, there should be one column of data available, i.e. a constraint
  column. The values of columns can be characters (A, B, C, etc.). The result of the
  imputed dataset will be returned a .csv file. For more details see Reza Rawassizadeh
