title: Probability Associator Time (PASS-T)
maintainer: Johannes Titz
description: |-
  Simulates judgments of frequency and duration based on
  the Probability Associator Time (PASS-T) model. PASS-T is a memory
  model based on a simple competitive artificial neural network. It
  can imitate human judgments of frequency and duration, which have
  been extensively studied in cognitive psychology
  (e.g. Hintzman (1970) <doi:10.1037/h0028865>, Betsch et al. (2010)
  <https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-18204-003>). The PASS-T model
  is an extension of the PASS model (Sedlmeier, 2002,
  ISBN:0198508638). The package provides an easy way to run
  simulations, which can then be compared with empirical data in
  human judgments of frequency and duration.
