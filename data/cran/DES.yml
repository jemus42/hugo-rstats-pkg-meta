title: Discrete Event Simulation
maintainer: Norm Matloff
description: |-
  Discrete event simulation (DES) involves modeling of systems
  having discrete, i.e. abrupt, state changes. For instance, when a job
  arrives to a queue, the queue length abruptly increases by 1.  This
  package is an R implementation of the event-oriented approach to DES;
