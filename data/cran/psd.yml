title: Adaptive, Sine-Multitaper Power Spectral Density Estimation
maintainer: Andrew J. Barbour
description: |-
  Produces power spectral density estimates through iterative
  refinement of the optimal number of sine-tapers at each frequency. This
  optimization procedure is based on the method of Riedel and Sidorenko
  (1995), which minimizes the Mean Square Error (sum of variance and bias)
  at each frequency, but modified for computational stability.
