title: Reverse Ecology Analysis on Microbiome
maintainer: Yang Cao
description: |-
  An implementation of the reverse ecology framework. Reverse ecology
  refers to the use of genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions
  about the organism(s) under consideration, linking organisms to their
  environment. It allows researchers to reconstruct the metabolic networks and
  study the ecology of poorly characterized microbial species from their
  genomic information, and has substantial potentials for microbial community
  ecological analysis.
