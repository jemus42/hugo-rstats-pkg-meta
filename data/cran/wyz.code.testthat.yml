version: 1.1.17
title: Wizardry Code Offensive Programming Test Generation
maintainer: Fabien Gelineau
description: |-
  Allows to generate automatically 'testthat' code files from offensive
  programming test cases. Generated test files are complete and ready to run.
  Using 'wyz.code.testthat' you will earn a lot of time, reduce the number of
  errors in test case production, be able to test immediately generated files
  without any need to view or modify them, and enter a zero time latency between
  code implementation and industrial testing. As with 'testthat', you may
  complete provided test cases according to your needs to push testing further,
  but this need is nearly void when using 'wyz.code.offensiveProgramming'.
