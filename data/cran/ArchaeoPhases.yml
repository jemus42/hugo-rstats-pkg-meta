  Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by 'ChronoModel',
  'Oxcal' or 'BCal'
maintainer: Anne Philippe
description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological
  dates and groups of dates. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains
  whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates.
  Such output can be simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel'
  (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr>), 'Oxcal' (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>)
  or 'BCal' (see <http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). The only requirement is to have a csv
  file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.
