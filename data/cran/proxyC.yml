title: Computes Proximity in Large Sparse Matrices
maintainer: Kohei Watanabe
description: |2-

  Computes proximity between rows or columns of large matrices efficiently in C++.
  Functions are optimised for large sparse matrices using the Armadillo and Intel TBB libraries.
  Among several built-in similarity/distance measures, computation of correlation,
  cosine similarity and Euclidean distance is particularly fast.
