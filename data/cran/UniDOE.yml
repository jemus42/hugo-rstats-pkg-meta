title: Uniform Design of Experiments
maintainer: Aijun Zhang
description: Efficient procedures for constructing uniform design of experiments under
  various space-filling criteria. It is based on a stochastic and adaptive threshold
  accepting algorithm with flexible initialization, adaptive threshold, and stochastic
  evolution. The package may also construct the augmented uniform designs in a sequential
  manner.
