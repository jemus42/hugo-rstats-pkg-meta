  Functions for Performing Local FDR Estimation when Null and
  Alternative are Poisson
maintainer: Kris Sankaran
description: The main idea of the Local FDR algorithm is to estimate both proportion
  of null observations and the ratio of null and alternative densities. In the case
  that there are many null observations, this can be done reliably, through maximum
  likelihood or generalized linear models. This package implements this in the case
  that the null and alternative densities are Poisson.
