title: Genome-Wide Structural Equation Modeling
maintainer: Joshua N. Pritikin
description: |-
  Melds genome-wide association tests with structural
  equation modeling (SEM) using 'OpenMx'. This package contains
  low-level C/C++ code to rapidly read genetic data encoded in U.K.
  Biobank or 'plink' formats. Prebuilt modeling options include one and
  two factor models. Alternately, analyses may utilize arbitrary,
  user-provided SEMs.  See Verhulst, Maes, & Neale (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s10519-017-9842-6> for details. An updated manuscript is
  in preparation.
