maintainer: Florian Hartig
description: |-
  Provides an R interface for the PROFOUND database <doi:10.5880/PIK.2019.008>. The
  PROFOUND database contains a wide range of data  to evaluate vegetation models and simulate climate
  impacts at the forest stand scale. It includes 9 forest sites across Europe, and provides for them a site
  description as well as soil, climate, CO2, Nitrogen deposition, tree-level, forest stand-level
  and remote sensing data. Moreover, for a subset of 5 sites, also time series of carbon fluxes,
  energy balances and soil water are available.
