title: Analysing Conditional Income Distributions
maintainer: Alexander Sohn
description: Functions for the analysis of income distributions for subgroups of the
  population as defined by a set of variables like age, gender, region, etc. This
  entails a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for a mixture distribution as well as functions
  for moments, inequality measures, entropy measures and polarisation measures of
  income distributions. This package thus aides the analysis of income inequality
  by offering tools for the exploratory analysis of income distributions at the disaggregated
  level.
