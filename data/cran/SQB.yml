description: 'Methodology: Remove one observation. Training the rest of data that
  are sampled without replacement and given this observation''s input, predict the
  response back. Replicate this N times and for each response, take a sample from
  these replicates with replacement. Average each responses of sample and again replicate
  this step N time for each observation. Approximate these N new responses by using
  bootstrap method and generate another N responses y''. Training these y'' and predict
  to have N responses of each testing observation. The average of N is the final prediction.
  Each observation will do the same.'
