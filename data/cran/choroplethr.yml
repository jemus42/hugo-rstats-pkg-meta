title: Simplify the Creation of Choropleth Maps in R
maintainer: Ari Lamstein
description: |-
  Choropleths are thematic maps where geographic regions, such as
  states, are colored according to some metric, such as the number of people
  who live in that state. This package simplifies this process by 1.
  Providing ready-made functions for creating choropleths of common maps. 2.
  Providing data and API connections to interesting data sources for making
  choropleths. 3. Providing a framework for creating choropleths from
  arbitrary shapefiles. 4. Overlaying those maps over reference maps from
  Google Maps.
