title: Functions for Optimal Matching
maintainer: Mark M. Fredrickson
description: |-
  Distance based bipartite matching using the RELAX-IV minimum cost flow solver,
  oriented to matching of treatment and control groups in observational
  studies. Routines are provided to generate distances from generalised linear models (propensity
  score matching), formulas giving variables on which to limit matched distances, stratified or
  exact matching directives, or calipers, alone or in combination.
