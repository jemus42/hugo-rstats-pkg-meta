title: Identify and Parse Web Security Policies Files
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  When security risks in web services are discovered by independent
  security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they
  often lack the channels to properly disclose them. As a result,
  security issues may be left unreported. The 'security.txt' 'Web Security Policies'
  specification defines an 'IETF' draft standard <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00>
  to help organizations define the process for security researchers to securely
  disclose security vulnerabilities. Tools are provided to help identify and
  parse 'security.txt' files to enable analysis of the usage and adoption of these policies.
