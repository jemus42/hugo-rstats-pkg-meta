title: Taba Linear and Taba Rank Correlations
maintainer: Derek Wilus
description: |-
  Calculates the robust Taba linear and Taba rank (monotonic)
  correlations. Test statistics as well as one sided or two sided p-values are provided
  for Taba and Taba rank correlations. Multiple correlations and p-values can be calculated
  simultaneously across multiple variables. In addition, users will have the option to use
  the partial, semipartial, and generalized partial correlations; where the partial and
  semipartial correlations use linear, logistic, or Poisson regression to modify the specified
  variable.
