  Prediction and Accuracy Measures for Nonlinear Models and for
  Right-Censored Time-to-Event Data

description: |-
  We propose a pair of summary measures for the predictive power of a prediction
  function based on a regression model. The regression model can be linear
  or nonlinear, parametric, semi-parametric, or nonparametric, and correctly
  specified or mis-specified. The first measure, R-squared, is an extension of
  the classical R-squared statistic for a linear model, quantifying the prediction
  function's ability to capture the variability of the response. The second
  measure, L-squared, quantifies the prediction function's bias for predicting the
  mean regression function. When used together, they give a complete summary of
  the predictive power of a prediction function. Please refer to Gang Li and Xiaoyan Wang (2016) <arXiv:1611.03063> for more details.
