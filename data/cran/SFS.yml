title: Similarity-First Search Seriation Algorithm
maintainer: Utz-Uwe Haus
description: An implementation of the Similarity-First Search algorithm (SFS), a combinatorial
  algorithm which can be used to solve the seriation problem and to recognize some
  structured weighted graphs. The SFS algorithm represents a generalization to weighted
  graphs of the graph search algorithm Lexicographic Breadth-First Search (Lex-BFS),
  a variant of Breadth-First Search. The SFS algorithm reduces to Lex-BFS when applied
  to binary matrices (or, equivalently, unweighted graphs). Hence this library can
  be also considered for Lex-BFS applications such as recognition of graph classes
  like chordal or unit interval graphs. In fact, the SFS seriation algorithm implemented
  in this package is a multisweep algorithm, which consists in repeating a finite
  number of SFS iterations (at most n sweeps for a matrix of size n). If the data
  matrix has a Robinsonian structure, then the ranking returned by the multistep SFS
  algorithm is a Robinson ordering of the input matrix. Otherwise the algorithm can
  be used as a heuristic to return a ranking partially satisfying the Robinson property.
