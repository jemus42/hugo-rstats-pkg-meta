title: Taking the Pain Out of Catching and Handling Conditions
maintainer: Zachary Burchill
description: |-
  R has a unique way of dealing with warnings, errors, messages,
  and other conditions, but it can often be troublesome to users coming
  from different programming backgrounds. The purpose of this package is
  to provide flexible and useful tools for handling R conditions with
  less hassle. In order to lower the barrier of entry, keep code clean
  and readable, and reduce the amount of typing required, `catchr` uses
  a very simple domain-specific language that simplifies things on the
  front-end.
  This package aims to maintain a continuous learning curve that lets new
  users jump straight in to condition-handling, while simultaneously
  offering depth and complexity for more advanced users.
