maintainer: Junheng Ma
description: 'Numerical Formal Concept Analysis (nFCA) is a modern unsupervised learning
  tool for analyzing general numerical data. Given input data, this R package nFCA
  outputs two nFCA graphs: a H-graph and an I-graph that reveal systematic, hierarchical
  clustering and inherent structure of the data.'
