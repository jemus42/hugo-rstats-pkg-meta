title: Import Professional Baseball Data from 'Retrosheet'
maintainer: Colin Douglas
description: |-
  A collection of tools to import and structure the (currently) single-season
  event, game-log, roster, and schedule data available from <http://www.retrosheet.org>.
  In particular, the event (a.k.a. play-by-play) files can be especially difficult to parse.
  This package does the parsing on those files, returning the requested data in the most
  practical R structure to use for sabermetric or other analyses.
