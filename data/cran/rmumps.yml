title: Wrapper for MUMPS Library
maintainer: Serguei Sokol
description: |-
  Some basic features of 'MUMPS' (Multifrontal Massively Parallel
  sparse direct Solver) are wrapped in a class whose methods can be used
  for sequentially solving a sparse linear system (symmetric or not)
  with one or many right hand sides (dense or sparse).
  There is a possibility to do separately symbolic analysis,
  LU (or LDL^t) factorization and system solving.
  Third part ordering libraries are included and can be used: 'PORD', 'METIS', 'SCOTCH'.
  'MUMPS' method was first described in Amestoy et al. (2001) <doi:10.1137/S0895479899358194>
  and Amestoy et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.parco.2005.07.004>.
