maintainer: Lucas Leemann
description: Provides functions to estimate a strategic selection estimator. A strategic
  selection estimator is an agent error model in which the two random components are
  not assumed to be orthogonal. In addition this package provides generic functions
  to print and plot objects of its class as well as the necessary functions to create
  tables for LaTeX. There is also a function to create dyadic data sets.
