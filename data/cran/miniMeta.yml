title: Web Application to Run Meta-Analyses
maintainer: Theodore Lytras
description: |-
  Shiny web application to run meta-analyses.
  Essentially a graphical front-end to package 'meta' for R.
  Can be useful as an educational tool, and for quickly
  analyzing and sharing meta-analyses.
  Provides output to quickly fill in GRADE (Grading of
  Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations)
  Summary-of-Findings tables.
  Importantly, it allows further processing of the results
  inside R, in case more specific analyses are needed.
