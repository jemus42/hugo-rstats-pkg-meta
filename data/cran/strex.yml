version: 1.2.0
title: Extra String Manipulation Functions
maintainer: Rory Nolan
description: |-
  There are some things that I wish were easier with
  the 'stringr' or 'stringi' packages. The foremost of these is the
  extraction of numbers from strings. 'stringr' and 'stringi' make you
  figure out the regular expression for yourself; 'strex' takes care of
  this for you. There are many other handy functionalities in 'strex'.
  Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as a
  miscellany of string manipulation functions that cannot be found in
  'stringi' or 'stringr'.
