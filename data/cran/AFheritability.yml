  The Attributable Fraction (AF) Described as a Function of
  Disease Heritability, Prevalence and Intervention Specific
  Factors
maintainer: Elisabeth Dahlqwist
description: |-
  The AFfunction() is a function which returns an estimate of the Attributable Fraction (AF) and a plot of the AF as a function of heritability, disease prevalence, size of target group and intervention effect.
  Since the AF is a function of several factors, a shiny app is used to better illustrate how the relationship between the AF and heritability depends on several other factors. The app is ran by the function runShinyApp().
