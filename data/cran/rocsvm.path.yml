title: The Entire Solution Paths for ROC-SVM
maintainer: Seung Jun Shin
description: 'We develop the entire solution paths for ROC-SVM presented by Rakotomamonjy.
  The ROC-SVM solution path algorithm greatly facilitates the tuning procedure for
  regularization parameter, lambda in ROC-SVM by avoiding grid search algorithm which
  may be computationally too intensive. For more information on the ROC-SVM, see the
  report in the ROC Analysis in AI workshop(ROCAI-2004) : Hernàndez-Orallo, José,
  et al. (2004) <doi:10.1145/1046456.1046489>.'
