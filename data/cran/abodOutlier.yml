title: Angle-Based Outlier Detection
maintainer: Jose Jimenez
description: Performs angle-based outlier detection on a given dataframe. Three methods
  are available, a full but slow implementation using all the data that has cubic
  complexity, a fully randomized one which is way more efficient and another using
  k-nearest neighbours. These algorithms are specially well suited for high dimensional
  data outlier detection.
