title: Various Methods to Estimate the AUC
maintainer: Dai Feng
description: |-
  Estimate the AUC using a variety of methods as follows:
  (1) frequentist nonparametric methods based on the Mann-Whitney statistic or kernel methods.
  (2) frequentist parametric methods using the likelihood ratio test based on higher-order
  asymptotic results, the signed log-likelihood ratio test, the Wald test,
  or the approximate ''t'' solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem.
  (3) Bayesian parametric MCMC methods.
