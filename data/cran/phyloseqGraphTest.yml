title: Graph-Based Permutation Tests for Microbiome Data
maintainer: Julia Fukuyama
description: |-
  Provides functions for graph-based multiple-sample
  testing and visualization of microbiome data, in particular data
  stored in 'phyloseq' objects. The tests are based on those
  described in Friedman and Rafsky (1979)
  <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958919>, and the tests are described
  in more detail in Callahan et al. (2016)
  <doi:10.12688/f1000research.8986.1>.
