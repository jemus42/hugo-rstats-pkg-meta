title: Meta-Analysis of Phase I Dose-Finding Early Clinical Trials
maintainer: Artemis Toumazi
description: 'Meta-analysis approaches for Phase I dose finding early phases clinical
  trials in order to better suit requirements in terms of maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
  and maximal dose regimen (MDR). This package has currently three different approaches:
  (a) an approach proposed by Zohar et al, 2011, <doi:10.1002/sim.4121> (denoted as
  ZKO), (b) the Variance Weighted pooling analysis (called VarWT) and (c) the Random
  Effects Model Based (REMB) algorithm, where user can input his/her own model based
  approach or use the existing random effect logistic regression model (named as glimem)
  through the ''dfmeta'' package.'
