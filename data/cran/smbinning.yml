title: Scoring Modeling and Optimal Binning
maintainer: Herman Jopia
description: |-
  A set of functions to build a scoring model from beginning to end, leading the user
  to follow an efficient and organized development process, reducing significantly the time
  spent on data exploration, variable selection, feature engineering, binning and model selection
  among other recurrent tasks.
  The package also incorporates monotonic and customized binning, scaling capabilities that
  transforms logistic coefficients into points for a better business understanding and
  calculates and visualizes classic performance metrics of a classification model.
