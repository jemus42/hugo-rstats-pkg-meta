title: Amino Acid Substitution Effect Analyser
maintainer: Raja Sekhara Reddy D.M
description: 'Given a protein multiple sequence alignment, it is daunting task to
  assess the effects of substitutions along sequence length. ''aaSEA'' package is
  intended to help researchers to rapidly analyse property changes caused by single,
  multiple and correlated amino acid substitutions in proteins. Methods for identification
  of co-evolving positions from multiple sequence alignment are as described in :  Pel√©
  et al., (2017) <doi:10.4172/2379-1764.1000250>.'
