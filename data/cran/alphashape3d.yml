  Implementation of the 3D Alpha-Shape for the Reconstruction of
  3D Sets from a Point Cloud
maintainer: Beatriz Pateiro-Lopez
description: Implementation in R of the alpha-shape of a finite set of points in the
  three-dimensional space. The alpha-shape generalizes the convex hull and allows
  to recover the shape of non-convex and even non-connected sets in 3D, given a random
  sample of points taken into it. Besides the computation of the alpha-shape, this
  package provides users with functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape,
  identify the connected components and facilitate the three-dimensional graphical
  visualization of the estimated set.
