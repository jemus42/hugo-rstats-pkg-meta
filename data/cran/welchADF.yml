  Welch-James Statistic for Robust Hypothesis Testing under
  Heterocedasticity and Non-Normality
maintainer: Pablo J. Villacorta
description: |-
  Implementation of Johansen's general formulation of Welch-James's statistic with Approximate Degrees of Freedom, which makes it suitable for testing
  any linear hypothesis concerning cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Some
  improvements, namely trimmed means and Winsorized variances, and bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value, have been added to the classical formulation.
  The code departs from a previous SAS implementation by L.M. Lix and H.J. Keselman, available at <http://supp.apa.org/psycarticles/supplemental/met_13_2_110/SAS_Program.pdf> and
  published in Keselman, H.J., Wilcox, R.R., and Lix, L.M. (2003) <DOI:10.1111/1469-8986.00060>.
