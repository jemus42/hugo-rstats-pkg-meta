title: Generates PFA Documents from R Code and Optionally Runs Them
maintainer: Steven Mortimer
description: |-
  Provides tools for converting R objects and syntax into the Portable
  Format for Analytics (PFA). Allows for testing validity and runtime behavior
  of PFA documents through rPython and Titus, a more complete implementation of
  PFA for Python. The Portable Format for Analytics is a specification for
  event-based processors that perform predictive or analytic calculations and is aimed
  at helping smooth the transition from statistical model development to large-scale
  and/or online production. See <http://dmg.org/pfa> for more information.
