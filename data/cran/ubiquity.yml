maintainer: John Harrold
description: 'Complete work flow for the analysis of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic
  (PKPD), physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and systems pharmacology models
  including: creation of ordinary differential equation-based models, pooled parameter
  estimation, individual/population based simulations, rule-based simulations for
  clinical trial design and modeling assays, deployment with a customizable ''Shiny''
  app, and non-compartmental analysis. System-specific analysis templates can be generated
  and each element includes integrated reporting with ''PowerPoint'' and ''Word''.'
