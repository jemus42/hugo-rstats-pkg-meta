title: The GiViTI Calibration Test and Belt
maintainer: Giovanni Nattino
description: Functions to assess the calibration of logistic regression models with
  the GiViTI (Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli interventi in Terapia Intensiva,
  Italian Group for the Evaluation of the Interventions in Intensive Care Units -
  see <http://www.giviti.marionegri.it/>) approach. The approach consists in a graphical
  tool, namely the GiViTI calibration belt, and in the associated statistical test.
  These tools can be used both to evaluate the internal calibration (i.e. the goodness
  of fit) and to assess the validity of an externally developed model.
