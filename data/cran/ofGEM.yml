  A Meta-Analysis Approach with Filtering for Identifying
  Gene-Level Gene-Environment Interactions with Genetic
  Association Data
maintainer: Jiebiao Wang
description: Offers a gene-based meta-analysis test with filtering to detect gene-environment
  interactions (GxE) with association data, proposed by Wang et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22115>.
  It first conducts a meta-filtering test to filter out unpromising SNPs by combining
  all samples in the consortia data. It then runs a test of omnibus-filtering-based
  GxE meta-analysis (ofGEM) that combines the strengths of the fixed- and random-effects
  meta-analysis with meta-filtering. It can also analyze data from multiple ethnic
  groups.
