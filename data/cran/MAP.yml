title: Multimodal Automated Phenotyping
maintainer: Jiehuan Sun
description: |-
  Electronic health records (EHR) linked with biorepositories are
  a powerful platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists
  in the ability to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently.
  Towards that end, we developed an automated high-throughput
  phenotyping method integrating International
  Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and narrative data extracted
  using natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, our proposed method,
  called MAP (Map Automated Phenotyping algorithm), fits an ensemble of latent
  mixture models on aggregated ICD and NLP counts along with healthcare
  utilization. The MAP algorithm yields a predicted probability of phenotype
  for each patient and a threshold for classifying subjects with phenotype
  yes/no (See Katherine P. Liao, et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/587436>.).
