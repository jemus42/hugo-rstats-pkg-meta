title: Plotting (Social) Networks on Maps
maintainer: Emmanuel Rousseaux
description: Facilitates the rendering of networks for which nodes have a specific
  position on a map (cities, participants in a political debate, etc.). Map data and
  network data are stored together in a single object which handles the match between
  network nodes and their respective position on the map. The plot method renders
  both the map and the network data. Several networks can be plot simultaneously.
  The graphic is highly customisable and the legend is automatically printed. Map
  data have to be supplied as 'SpatialPolygons' objects (from the 'sp' package) and
  network data as 'named matrix'.
