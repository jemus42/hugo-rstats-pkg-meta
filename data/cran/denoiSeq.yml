title: Differential Expression Analysis Using a Bottom-Up Model
maintainer: Gershom Buri
description: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts
  are differentially expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference
  of the parameters of  a bottom-up model for PCR amplification. This model is  developed
  in Ndifon Wilfred, Hilah Gal, Eric Shifrut, Rina Aharoni, Nissan Yissachar, Nir
  Waysbort, Shlomit Reich Zeliger, Ruth Arnon, and Nir Friedman (2012), <http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15865.full>,
  and results in a distribution for the counts that is a superposition of the binomial
  and negative binomial distribution.
