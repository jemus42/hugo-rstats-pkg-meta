title: Interface to the 'HDF5' Binary Data Format
maintainer: Holger Hoefling
description: |-
  'HDF5' is a data model, library and file format for storing
  and managing large amounts of data. This package provides a nearly
  feature complete, object oriented  wrapper for the 'HDF5' API
  <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5Front.html> using R6 classes.
  Additionally, functionality is added so that 'HDF5' objects behave very
  similar to their corresponding R counterparts.
