title: Hierarchical Bayesian Regression for GLMs
maintainer: Asad Hasan
description: Convenient and efficient functions for performing 2-level hierarchical
  Bayesian regression analysis for multi-group data. The lowest level may belong to
  the generalized linear model (GLM) family while the prior level, which effects pooling,
  allows for linear regression on lower level covariates. Constraints on all or part
  of the parameter set maybe specified with ease. A rich set of methods is included
  to visualize and analyze results.
