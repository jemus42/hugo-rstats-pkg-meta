version: 1.1.2
title: A Lightweight and Flexible Web Framework
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  A very flexible framework for building server side logic in R. The
  framework is unopinionated when it comes to how HTTP requests and WebSocket
  messages are handled and supports all levels of app complexity; from serving
  static content to full-blown dynamic web-apps. Fiery does not hold your hand
  as much as e.g. the shiny package does, but instead sets you free to create
  your web app the way you want.
