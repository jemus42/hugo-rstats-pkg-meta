title: Power Calculations for RD Designs
maintainer: Gonzalo Vazquez-Bare
description: 'The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental
  design for causal inference and policy evaluation. The ''rdpower'' package provides
  tools to perform power and sample size calculations in RD designs: rdpower() calculates
  the power of an RD design and rdsampsi() calculates the required sample size to
  achieve a desired power. See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2019) <https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdpower/Cattaneo-Titiunik-VazquezBare_2019_Stata.pdf>
  for further methodological details.'
