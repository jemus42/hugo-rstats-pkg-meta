title: Moon Charts, a Pie Chart Alternative
maintainer: Michael Bramson
description: |-
  Moon charts are like pie charts except that the proportions are
  shown as crescent or gibbous portions of a circle, like the lit and unlit
  portions of the moon. As such, they work best with only one or two groups.
  'gggibbous' extends 'ggplot2' to allow for plotting multiple moon charts in
  a single panel and does not require a square coordinate system.
