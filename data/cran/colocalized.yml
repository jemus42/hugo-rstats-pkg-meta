title: Clusters of Colocalized Sequences
maintainer: Stefan Golas
description: |-
  Also abbreviates to "CCSeq". Finds clusters of colocalized sequences in .bed annotation files
  up to a specified cut-off distance. Two sequences are colocalized if they
  are within the cut-off distance of each other, and clusters are sets of
  sequences where each sequence is colocalized to at least one other sequence
  in the cluster. For a set of .bed annotation tables provided in a list
  along with a cut-off distance, the program will output a file containing
  the locations of each cluster. Annotated .bed files are from
  the 'pwmscan' application at <https://ccg.epfl.ch/pwmtools/pwmscan.php>.
  Personal machines might crash or take excessively long depending
  on the number of annotated sequences in each file and whether chromsearch()
  or gensearch() is used.
