title: Tools and Classes for Statistical Models
maintainer: Torsten Hothorn
description: |-
  A collection of tools to deal with statistical models.
  The functionality is experimental and the user interface is likely to
  change in the future. The documentation is rather terse, but packages `coin'
  and `party' have some working examples. However, if you find the
  implemented ideas interesting we would be very interested in a discussion
  of this proposal. Contributions are more than welcome!
