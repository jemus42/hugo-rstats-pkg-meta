title: Covariate Balance Tables and Plots
maintainer: Noah Greifer
description: Generate balance tables and plots for covariates of groups preprocessed
  through matching, weighting or subclassification, for example, using propensity
  scores. Includes integration with 'MatchIt', 'twang', 'Matching', 'optmatch', 'CBPS',
  'ebal', 'WeightIt', and 'designmatch' for assessing balance on the output of their
  preprocessing functions. Users can also specify data for balance assessment not
  generated through the above packages. Also included are methods for assessing balance
  in clustered or multiply imputed data sets or data sets with longitudinal treatments.
