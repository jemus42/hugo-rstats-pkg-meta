  A Suite of Convergence Acceleration Schemes for EM, MM and Other
  Fixed-Point Algorithms
maintainer: Ravi Varadhan
description: |-
  Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow,
  monotone sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the
  EM and MM algorithms. It can be used to accelerate any smooth,
  linearly convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style
  introduction to this package is available in a vignette on the
  CRAN download page or, when the package is loaded in an R
  session, with vignette("turboEM").
