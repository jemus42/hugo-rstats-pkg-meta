  Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness
  Estimation
maintainer: Simon Wood
description: |-
  Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and
  other generalized ridge regression with multiple smoothing
  parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood,
  Generalized Cross Validation and similar, or using iterated
  nested Laplace approximation for fully Bayesian inference. See
  Wood (2017) <doi:10.1201/9781315370279> for an overview.
  Includes a gam() function, a wide variety of smoothers, 'JAGS'
  support and distributions beyond the exponential family.
