title: Calculate Optical Parameters from Spindle Stage Measurements
maintainer: Florian Dufey
description: |-
  Calculates optical parameters of crystals like the optical
  axes, the axis angle 2V, and the direction of the principal axes of
  the indicatrix from extinction angles measured on a spindle stage
  mounted on a polarisation microscope stage. Details of the method can be found in Dufey (2017) <arXiv:1703.00070>.
