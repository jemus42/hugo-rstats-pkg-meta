title: Detection of Kataegis
maintainer: Paul C. Boutros
description: Kataegis is a localized hypermutation occurring when a region is enriched
  in somatic SNVs. Kataegis can result from multiple cytosine deaminations catalyzed
  by the AID/APOBEC family of proteins. This package contains functions to detect
  kataegis from SNVs in BED format. This package reports two scores per kataegic event,
  a hypermutation score and an APOBEC mediated kataegic score. Yousif, F. et al.;
