title: Gene Network Inference from Time-Series Transcriptomic Data
maintainer: Mikael Lucas
description: The Time-Delay Correlation algorithm (TDCor) reconstructs the topology
  of a gene regulatory network (GRN) from time-series transcriptomic data.  The algorithm
  is described in details in Lavenus et al., Plant Cell, 2015.  It was initially developed
  to infer the topology of the GRN controlling lateral root formation in Arabidopsis
  thaliana.  The time-series transcriptomic dataset which was used in this study is
  included in the package to illustrate how to use it.
