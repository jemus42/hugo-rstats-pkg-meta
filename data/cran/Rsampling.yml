title: Ports the Workflow of "Resampling Stats" Add-in to R
maintainer: Paulo Prado
description: |-
  Resampling Stats (http://www.resample.com) is an add-in for
  running randomization tests in Excel worksheets. The workflow is (1) to define
  a statistic of interest that can be calculated from a data table, (2) to
  randomize rows ad/or columns of a data table to simulate a null hypothesis
  and (3) and to score the value of the statistic from many randomizations. The
  relative frequency distribution of the statistic in the simulations is then
  used to infer the probability of the observed value be generated by the null
  process (probability of Type I error). This package intends to translate this
  logic for R for teaching purposes. Keeping the original workflow is favored over
  performance.
