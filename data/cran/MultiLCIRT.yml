version: '2.11'
title: Multidimensional Latent Class Item Response Theory Models
maintainer: Francesco Bartolucci
description: Framework for the Item Response Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal
  polytomous outcomes under the assumption of multidimensionality and discreteness
  of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow for missing responses and for
  different item parameterizations and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm.
  Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be included in the new version
  (since 2.1).
