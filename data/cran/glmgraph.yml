  Graph-Constrained Regularization for Sparse Generalized Linear
  Models
maintainer: Li Chen
description: We propose to use sparse regression model to achieve variable selection
  while accounting for graph-constraints among coefficients. Different linear combination
  of a sparsity penalty(L1) and a smoothness(MCP) penalty has been used, which induces
  both sparsity of the solution and certain smoothness on the linear coefficients.
