title: Statistical Framework to Define Subgroups in Complex Datasets
maintainer: Ville-Petteri Makinen
description: 'High-dimensional datasets that do not exhibit a clear intrinsic clustered
  structure pose a challenge to conventional clustering algorithms. For this reason,
  we developed an unsupervised framework that helps scientists to better subgroup
  their datasets based on visual cues, please see Gao S, Mutter S, Casey A, Makinen
  V-P (2019) Numero: a statistical framework to define multivariable subgroups in
  complex population-based datasets, Int J Epidemiology, 48:369-37, <doi:10.1093/ije/dyy113>.
  The framework includes the necessary functions to construct a self-organizing map
  of the data, to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed data patterns,
  and to visualize the results.'
