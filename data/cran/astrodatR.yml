  are described the textbook `Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy with R Applications''
  by Eric D. Feigelson and G. Jogesh Babu (Cambridge University Press, 2012, Appendix
  C) or on the website of Penn State''s Center for Astrostatistics (http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets).  These
  datasets can be used to exercise methodology involving: density estimation; heteroscedastic
  measurement errors; contingency tables; two-sample hypothesis tests; spatial point
  processes; nonlinear regression; mixture models; censoring and truncation; multivariate
  analysis; classification and clustering; inhomogeneous Poisson processes; periodic
