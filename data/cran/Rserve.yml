version: 1.7-3.1
title: Binary R server
maintainer: Simon Urbanek
description: |-
  Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets)
  which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every
  connection has a separate workspace and working
  directory. Client-side implementations are available
  for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing
  any application to use facilities of R without the need of
  linking to R code. Rserve supports remote connection,
  user authentication and file transfer. A simple R client
  is included in this package as well.
