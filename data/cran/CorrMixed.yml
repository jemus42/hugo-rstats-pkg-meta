  Estimate Correlations Between Repeatedly Measured Endpoints
  (E.g., Reliability) Based on Linear Mixed-Effects Models
maintainer: Wim Van der Elst
description: In clinical practice and research settings in medicine and the behavioral
  sciences, it is often of interest to quantify the correlation of a continuous endpoint
  that was repeatedly measured (e.g., test-retest correlations, ICC, etc.). This package
  allows for estimating these correlations based on mixed-effects models. Part of
  this software has been developed using funding provided from the European Union's
  7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration
  under Grant Agreement no 602552.
