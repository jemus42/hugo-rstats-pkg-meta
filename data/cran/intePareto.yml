title: Integrative Analysis of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq Data
maintainer: Yingying Cao
description: |-
  Integrative analysis of gene expression (RNA-Seq data), and histone
  modification data for user-defined sets of histone marks (ChIP-Seq data) to
  discover consistent changes in genes between biological conditions.
  Additionally, Pareto optimization is used to prioritize genes based on the
  level of consistent changes in both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data.
