title: Pathway Enrichment Analysis Based on Bayesian Network
maintainer: Samaneh Maleknia
description: Maleknia et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.01.13.905448>. A novel pathway
  enrichment analysis package based on Bayesian network to investigate the topology
  features of the pathways. firstly, 187 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)
  human non-metabolic pathways which their cycles were eliminated by biological approach,
  enter in analysis as Bayesian network structures. The constructed Bayesian network
  were optimized by the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (lasso) and the
  parameters were learned based on gene expression data. Finally, the impacted pathways
  were enriched by Fisherâ€™s Exact Test on significant parameters.
