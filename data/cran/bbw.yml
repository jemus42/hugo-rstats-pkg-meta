title: Blocked Weighted Bootstrap
maintainer: Ernest Guevarra
description: |-
  The blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW) is an estimation technique
  for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either
  prior weighting (e.g. population-proportional sampling or PPS as used in
  Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions or SMART
  surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in rapid assessment method or
  RAM and simple spatial sampling method or S3M surveys). The method was
  developed by Accion Contra la Faim, Brixton Health, Concern Worldwide,
  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF Sierra Leone,  UNICEF Sudan
  and Valid International. It has been tested by the Centers for Disease
  Control (CDC) using infant and young child feeding (IYCF) data. See Cameron
  et al (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.3.414> for application of bootstrap
  to cluster samples. See Aaron et al (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0163176>
  and Aaron et al (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0162462> for application
  of the blocked weighted bootstrap to estimate indicators from two-stage
  cluster sampled surveys.
