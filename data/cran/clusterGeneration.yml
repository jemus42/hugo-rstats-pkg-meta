title: Random Cluster Generation (with Specified Degree of Separation)
maintainer: Weiliang Qiu
description: |-
  We developed the clusterGeneration package to provide functions
  for generating random clusters, generating random
  covariance/correlation matrices,
  calculating a separation index (data and population version)
  for pairs of clusters or cluster distributions, and 1-D and 2-D
  projection plots to visualize clusters.  The package also
  contains a function to generate random clusters based on
  factorial designs with factors such as degree of separation,
  number of clusters, number of variables, number of noisy
  variables.
