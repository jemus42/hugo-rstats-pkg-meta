  Functions to Perform Hierarchical Analysis of Distance Sampling

description: |-
  Functions for performing hierarchical analysis of distance
  sampling data, with ability to use an areal spatial ICAR model on
  top of user supplied covariates to get at variation in abundance
  intensity.  The detection model can be specified as a function of
  observer and individual covariates, where a parametric model is
  supposed for the population level distribution of covariate values.
  The model uses data augmentation and a reversible jump MCMC
  algorithm to sample animals that were never observed.  Also
  included is the ability to include point independence (increasing
  correlation multiple observer's observations as a function of
  distance, with independence assumed for distance=0 or first
  distance bin), as well as the ability to model species
  misclassification rates using a multinomial logit formulation on data
  from double observers.  There is also the the ability to
  include zero inflation, but this is only recommended for cases where
  sample sizes and spatial coverage of the survey are high.
