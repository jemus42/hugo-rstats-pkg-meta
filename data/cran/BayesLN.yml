title: Bayesian Inference for Log-Normal Data
maintainer: Aldo Gardini
description: Bayesian inference under log-normality assumption must be performed very
  carefully. In fact, under the common priors for the variance, useful quantities
  in the original data scale (like mean and quantiles) do not have posterior moments
  that are finite (Fabrizi et al. 2012 <doi:10.1214/12-BA733>). This package allows
  to easily carry out a proper Bayesian inferential procedure by fixing a suitable
  distribution (the generalized inverse Gaussian) as prior for the variance. Functions
  to estimate several kind of means (unconditional, conditional and conditional under
  a mixed model) and quantiles (unconditional and conditional) are provided.
