title: Integrate R with 'RDocumentation'
maintainer: Ludovic Vannoorenberghe
description: Wraps around the default help functionality in R. Instead of plain documentation
  files, documentation will show up as it does on <https://www.rdocumentation.org>,
  a platform that shows R documentation from 'CRAN', 'GitHub' and 'Bioconductor',
  together with informative stats to assess the package quality.
