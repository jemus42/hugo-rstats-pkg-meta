  Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) Design for Single-Agent and
  Drug- Combination Phase I Clinical Trials
maintainer: Ying Yuan
description: |-
  The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I
  clinical trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It can be
  used to design both single-agent and drug-combination trials. The BOIN design
  is motivated by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new
  drug, which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing
  them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent advantage of the
  BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same
  time. The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple
  way similar to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an average
  performance that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method
  (CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but
  has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly
  toxic doses.
