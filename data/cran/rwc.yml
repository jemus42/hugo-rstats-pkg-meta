title: Random Walk Covariance Models
maintainer: Ephraim M. Hanks
description: Code to facilitate simulation and inference when connectivity is defined
  by underlying random walks. Methods for spatially-correlated pairwise distance data
  are especially considered. This provides core code to conduct analyses similar to
  that in Hanks and Hooten (2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.724647>.
