title: Cyanobacteria Population Identification for Flow Cytometry
maintainer: Oluwafemi Olusoji
description: |-
  An approach to filter out and/or identify synechococcus type cyanobacteria cells from all particles measured via flow cytometry.
  It combines known characteristics of these cyanobacteria strains alongside gating techniques developed by Mehrnoush, M. et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu677>
  in the 'flowDensity' package to identify and separate these cyanobacteria cells from other cell types.
  Aside the gating techniques in the 'flowDensity' package, an EM style clustering technique
  is also developed to identify these cyanobacteria cell populations.
