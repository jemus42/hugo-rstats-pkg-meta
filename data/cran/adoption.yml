title: Modelling Adoption Process in Marketing
maintainer: Martin Schlather
description: The classical Bass (1969) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215> model and the agent
  based models, such as that by Goldenberg, Libai and Muller (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.06.006>
  have been two different approaches to model adoption processes in marketing. These
  two approaches can be unified by explicitly modelling the utility functions. This
  package provides a GUI that allows, in a unified way, the modelling of these two
  processes and other processes.
