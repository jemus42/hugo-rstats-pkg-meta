description: |-
  Google's Compact Language Detector 3 is a neural network model for language
  identification and the successor of 'cld2' (available from CRAN). The algorithm is still
  experimental and takes a novel approach to language detection with different properties
  and outcomes. It can be useful to combine this with the Bayesian classifier results
  from 'cld2'. See <https://github.com/google/cld3#readme> for more information.
