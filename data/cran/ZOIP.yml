description: The ZOIP distribution (Zeros Ones Inflated Proportional) is a proportional
  data distribution inflated with zeros and/or ones, this distribution is defined
  on the most known proportional data distributions, the beta and simplex distribution,
  JÃ¸rgensen and Barndorff-Nielsen (1991) <doi:10.1016/0047-259X(91)90008-P>, also
  allows it to have different parameterizations of the beta distribution, Ferrari
  and Cribari-Neto (2004) <doi:10.1080/0266476042000214501>, Rigby and Stasinopoulos
  (2005) <doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i07>. The ZOIP distribution has four parameters, two
  of which correspond to the proportion of zeros and ones, and the other two correspond
  to the distribution of the proportional data of your choice. The 'ZOIP' package
  allows adjustments of regression models for fixed and mixed effects for proportional
  data inflated with zeros and/or ones.
