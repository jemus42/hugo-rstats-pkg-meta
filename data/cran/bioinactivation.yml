title: Mathematical Modelling of (Dynamic) Microbial Inactivation
maintainer: Alberto Garre
description: |-
  Functions for modelling microbial inactivation under
  isothermal or dynamic conditions. The calculations are based on several mathematical models broadly
  used by the scientific community and industry. Functions enable to make predictions for cases where the
  kinetic parameters are known. It also implements functions for parameter estimation for isothermal and
  dynamic conditions. The model fitting capabilities include an Adaptive Monte Carlo method for a Bayesian
  approach to parameter estimation.
