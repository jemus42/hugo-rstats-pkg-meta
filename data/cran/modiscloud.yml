title: R tools for processing Level 2 Cloud Mask products from MODIS
maintainer: Nicholas J. Matzke
description: |-
  Package for processing downloaded MODIS Cloud Product HDF
  files and derived files. Specifically, MOD35_L2 cloud product
  files, and the associated MOD03 geolocation files (for
  MODIS-TERRA); and MYD35_L2 cloud product files, and the
  associated MYD03 geolocation files (for MODIS-AQUA).  The
  package will be most effective if the user installs MRTSwath
  (MODIS Reprojection Tool for swath products;
  https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool_swath),
  and adds the directory with the MRTSwath executable to the
  default R PATH by editing ~/.Rprofile.
