maintainer: Enrico Schumann
description: |-
  Utilities for handling character vectors
  that store human-readable text (either plain or with
  markup, such as HTML or LaTeX). The package provides,
  in particular, functions that help with the
  preparation of plain-text reports, e.g. for expanding
  and aligning strings that form the lines of such
  reports. The package also provides generic functions for
  transforming R objects to HTML and to plain text.
