  assessment of the epidemic and intensity status to help in routine respiratory infections
  surveillance in health systems. Allows the comparison of different epidemic indicators,
  timing and shape with past epidemics and across different regions or countries with
  different surveillance systems. Also, it gives a measure of the performance of the
  method in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the alert week. 'memapp' is a
  web application created in the Shiny framework for the 'mem' R package.
