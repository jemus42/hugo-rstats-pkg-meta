title: Mixed-Frequency Bayesian VAR Models
maintainer: Sebastian Ankargren
description: Estimation of mixed-frequency Bayesian vector autoregressive (VAR) models.
  The package implements a state space-based VAR model that handles mixed frequencies
  of the data. The model is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to numerically
  approximate the posterior distribution. Prior distributions that can be used include
  normal-inverse Wishart and normal-diffuse priors as well as steady-state priors.
  Stochastic volatility can be handled by common or factor stochastic volatility models.
