maintainer: Wolfgang Konen
description: |-
  Tuned Data Mining in R ('TDMR') performs the complete tuning of a
  data mining task (predictive analytics, that is classification and regression).
  Preprocessing parameters and modeling parameters can be tuned simultaneously.
  It incorporates a variety of tuners (among them 'SPOT' and 'CMA' with package 'rCMA') and
  allows integration of additional tuners. Noise handling in the data mining optimization
  process is supported, see Koch et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.asoc.2015.01.005>.
