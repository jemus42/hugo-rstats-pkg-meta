title: Get Data Out of 'Tautulli' (Formerly 'PlexPy')
maintainer: Lukas Burk
description: |-
  'Tautulli' (<http://tautulli.com>) is a monitoring application for 'Plex' Media Servers
  (<https://www.plex.tv>) which collects a lot of data about media items and server
  usage such as play counts. This package interacts with the 'Tautulli' API of any
  specified server to get said data into R. The 'Tautulli' API documentation is available
  at <https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/blob/master/API.md>.
