description: Functions for identification and transportation of causal effects. Provides
  a conditional causal effect identification algorithm (IDC) by Shpitser, I. and Pearl,
  J. (2006) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r329-uai.pdf>, an algorithm for transportability
  from multiple domains with limited experiments by Bareinboim, E. and Pearl, J. (2014)
  <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r443.pdf> and a selection bias recovery algorithm
  by Bareinboim, E. and Tian, J. (2015) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r445.pdf>.
  All of the previously mentioned algorithms are based on a causal effect identification
  algorithm by Tian , J. (2002) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r309.pdf>.
