maintainer: Paul Sheridan
description: An implementation of 1) the hypergeometric test for over-representation
  of literary themes in a storyset (a list of stories) relative to a background list
  of stories, and 2) a recommendation system that takes a user-selected story as input
  and returns a ranked list of similar stories on the basis of shared themes. The
  package is currently implemented for the episodes of the Star Trek television franchise
  series The Original Series (TOS), The Animated Series (TAS), The Next Generation
  (TNG), and Voyager (VOY).
