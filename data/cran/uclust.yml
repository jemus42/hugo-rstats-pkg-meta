title: Clustering and Classification Inference with U-Statistics
maintainer: Gabriela Cybis
description: |-
  Clustering and classification inference for high dimension low sample size (HDLSS)
  data with U-statistics. The package contains implementations of nonparametric statistical
  tests for sample homogeneity, group separation, clustering, and classification of
  multivariate data. The methods have high statistical power and are tailored for data
  in which the dimension L is much larger than sample size n. See Gabriela B. Cybis,
  Marcio Valk and SÃ­lvia RC Lopes (2018) <doi:10.1080/00949655.2017.1374387> and Marcio
  Valk and Gabriela B. Cybis (2018) <arXiv:1805.12179>.
