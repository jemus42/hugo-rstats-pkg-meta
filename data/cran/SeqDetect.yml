maintainer: Dalibor Krleža
description: |-
  Sequence detector in this package contains a specific automaton model that can be used to learn and detect data and process sequences.
  Automaton model in this package is capable of learning and tracing sequences. Automaton model can be found in Krleža, Vrdoljak, Brčić (2019) <doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955245>.
