  Influence Measures and Diagnostic Plots for Multivariate Linear
  Models
maintainer: Michael Friendly
description: |-
  Computes regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models and provides some associated
  diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and
  generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to detect influential observations are
  provided.
