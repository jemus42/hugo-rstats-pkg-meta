version: 0.2.0
title: Machine Learning in R - Next Generation
maintainer: Michel Lang
description: |-
  Efficient, object-oriented programming on the
  building blocks of machine learning. Provides 'R6' objects for tasks,
  learners, resamplings, and measures. The package is geared towards
  scalability and larger datasets by supporting parallelization and
  out-of-memory data-backends like databases. While 'mlr3' focuses on
  the core computational operations, add-on packages provide additional
  functionality.
