title: Mining Univariate and Multivariate Motifs in Time-Series Data
maintainer: Cheng Fan
description: 'Implementations of a number of functions used to mine numeric time-series
  data. It covers the implementation of SAX transformation, univariate motif discovery
  (based on the random projection method), multivariate motif discovery (based on
  graph clustering), and several functions used for the ease of visualizing the motifs
  discovered. The details of SAX transformation can be found in J. Lin. E. Keogh,
  L. Wei, S. Lonardi, Experiencing SAX: A novel symbolic representation of time series,
  Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 15 (2) (2007) 107-144. Details on univariate
  motif discovery method implemented can be found in B. Chiu, E. Keogh, S. Lonardi,
  Probabilistic discovery of time series motifs, ACM SIGKDD, Washington, DC, USA,
  2003, pp. 493-498. Details on the multivariate motif discovery method implemented
  can be found in A. Vahdatpour, N. Amini, M. Sarrafzadeh, Towards unsupervised activity
  discovery using multi-dimensional motif detection in time series, IJCAI 2009 21st
  International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.'
