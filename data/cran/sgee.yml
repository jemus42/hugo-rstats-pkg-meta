title: Stagewise Generalized Estimating Equations
maintainer: Gregory Vaughan
description: Stagewise techniques implemented with Generalized Estimating Equations
  to handle individual, group, bi-level, and interaction selection. Stagewise approaches
  start with an empty model and slowly build the model over several iterations, which
  yields a 'path' of candidate models from which model selection can be performed.
  This 'slow brewing' approach gives stagewise techniques a unique flexibility that
  allows simple incorporation of Generalized Estimating Equations; see Vaughan, G.,
  Aseltine, R., Chen, K., Yan, J., (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12669> for details.
