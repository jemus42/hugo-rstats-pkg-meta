title: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
maintainer: Tomasz Konopka
description: |-
  Uniform manifold approximation and projection is a technique
  for dimension reduction. The algorithm was described by McInnes and
  Healy (2018) in <arXiv:1802.03426>. This package provides an interface
  for two implementations. One is written from scratch, including components
  for nearest-neighbor search and for embedding. The second implementation
  is a wrapper for 'python' package 'umap-learn' (requires separate
  installation, see vignette for more details).
