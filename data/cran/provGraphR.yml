  Creates and manages a provenance graph corresponding to the
  provenance created by the 'rdtLite' package, which
  collects provenance from R scripts.  'rdtLite' is available on CRAN.
  The provenance format is an extension of the
  W3C PROV JSON format (<https://www.w3.org/Submission/2013/SUBM-prov-json-20130424/>).
  The extended JSON provenance format is described
  in <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.
