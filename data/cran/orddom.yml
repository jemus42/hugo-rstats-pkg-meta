maintainer: Jens J. Rogmann
description: |-
  Computes ordinal, statistics and effect sizes as an
  alternative to mean comparison: Cliff's delta or success rate
  difference (SRD), Vargha and Delaney's A or the Area Under a
  Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), the discrete
  type of McGraw & Wong's Common Language Effect Size (CLES) or
  Grissom & Kim's Probability of Superiority (PS), and the Number
  needed to treat (NNT) effect size. Moreover, comparisons to
  Cohen's d are offered based on Huberty & Lowman's Percentage of
  Group (Non-)Overlap considerations.
