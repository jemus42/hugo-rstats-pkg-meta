  Integrated Prediction using Uni-Variate and Multivariate Random
  Forests
maintainer: Raziur Rahman
description: An implementation of a framework for drug sensitivity prediction from
  various genetic characterizations using ensemble approaches. Random Forests or Multivariate
  Random Forest predictive models can be generated from each genetic characterization
  that are then combined using a Least Square Regression approach. It also provides
  options for the use of different error estimation approaches of Leave-one-out, Bootstrap,
  N-fold cross validation and 0.632+Bootstrap along with generation of prediction
  confidence interval using Jackknife-after-Bootstrap approach.
