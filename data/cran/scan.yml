  A collection of procedures for analysing, visualising,
  and managing single-case data. These include piecewise linear regression
  models, multilevel models, overlap indices (PND, PEM, PAND, PET, tauU,
  baseline corrected tau), and randomization tests. Data preparation functions
  support outlier detection, handling missing values, scaling, truncating,
  rank transformation, and smoothing. An exporting function help to generate
  html and latex tables in a publication friendly style. More details can be
  found at <https://jazznbass.github.io/scan-Book/>.
