title: Functions for Generating Restricted Permutations of Data
maintainer: Gavin L. Simpson
description: A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line
  transects (time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups
  of samples) is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the
  whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one of the restricted
  designs. The 'permute' package is modelled after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco
  3.1' (and later) by Cajo ter Braak.
