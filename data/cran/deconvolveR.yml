title: Empirical Bayes Estimation Strategies
maintainer: Balasubramanian Narasimhan
description: |-
  Empirical Bayes methods for learning prior distributions from data.
  An unknown prior distribution (g) has yielded (unobservable) parameters, each of
  which produces a data point from a parametric exponential family (f). The goal
  is to estimate the unknown prior ("g-modeling") by deconvolution and Empirical
  Bayes methods.
