title: Calculates Study Size Required for Distance Sampling
maintainer: Robert Clark
description: |-
  Calculates the study size (either number of detections, or
  proportion of region that should be covered) to achieve a target precision for
  the estimated abundance. The calculation allows for the penalty due to unknown
  detection function, and for overdispersion. The user must specify a guess at the
  true detection function.
