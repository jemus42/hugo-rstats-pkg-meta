  call options. The following cases are covered: Pricing<U+000a>of an American call
  using the standard binomial approximation;<U+000a>Hedge parameters for an American
  call with a standard binomial<U+000a>tree; Binomial pricing of an American call
  with continuous<U+000a>payout from the underlying asset; Binomial pricing of an<U+000a>American
  call with an underlying stock that pays proportional<U+000a>dividends in discrete
  time; Pricing of an American call on<U+000a>futures using a binomial approximation;
  Pricing of a currency<U+000a>futures American call using a binomial approximation;
  Pricing<U+000a>of a perpetual American call. The user should kindly notice<U+000a>that
  this material is for educational purposes only. The codes<U+000a>are not optimized
  for computational efficiency as they are<U+000a>meant to represent standard cases
  of analytical and numerical<U+000a>solution.'
