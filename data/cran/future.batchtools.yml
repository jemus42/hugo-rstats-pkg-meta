  A Future API for Parallel and Distributed Processing using
  'batchtools'
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: |-
  Implementation of the Future API on top of the 'batchtools' package.
  This allows you to process futures, as defined by the 'future' package,
  in parallel out of the box, not only on your local machine or ad-hoc
  cluster of machines, but also via high-performance compute ('HPC') job
  schedulers such as 'LSF', 'OpenLava', 'Slurm', 'SGE', and 'TORQUE' / 'PBS',
  e.g. 'y <- future.apply::future_lapply(files, FUN = process)'.
