title: Sampling Estimates
maintainer: Emilio Lopez Escobar
description: Functions to estimate from survey data. This package is a user-friendly
  wrapper of the samplingVarEst package. It considers that the user is more familiar
  with practical survey data rather than with research on survey sampling (variance
  estimation). More functionalities are on the way.
