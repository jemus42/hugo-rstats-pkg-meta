title: plotting custom sequence logos
maintainer: Omar Wagih
description: |-
  RWebLogo is a wrapper for the WebLogo python package
  that allows generating of customised sequence logos. Sequence logos are
  graphical representations of the sequence conservation of nucleotides (in a
  strand of DNA/RNA) or amino acids (in protein sequences). Each logo
  consists of stacks of symbols, one stack for each position in the sequence.
  The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that
  position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the
  relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position. In
  general, a sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description of,
  for example, a binding site, than would a consensus sequence.
