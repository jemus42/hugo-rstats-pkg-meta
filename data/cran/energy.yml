title: 'E-Statistics: Multivariate Inference via the Energy of Data'
maintainer: Maria Rizzo
description: |-
  E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference,
  including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for
  comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing
  multivariate independence based on distance correlation, partial distance correlation,
  multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, k-groups and hierarchical clustering based on energy
  distance, testing for multivariate normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric
  analysis of structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
