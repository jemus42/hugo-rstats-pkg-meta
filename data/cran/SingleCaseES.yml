title: A Calculator for Single-Case Effect Sizes
maintainer: James E. Pustejovsky
description: |2-

  Provides R functions for calculating basic effect size indices for
  single-case designs, including several non-overlap measures and parametric
  effect size measures, and for estimating the gradual effects model developed
  by Swan and Pustejovsky (2018) <DOI:10.1080/00273171.2018.1466681>.
  Standard errors and confidence intervals (based on the assumption that the outcome
  measurements are mutually independent) are provided for the subset of effect sizes
  indices with known sampling distributions.
