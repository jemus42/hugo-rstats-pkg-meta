  Trend Estimation of Univariate and Bivariate Time Series with
  Controlled Smoothness
maintainer: L. Leticia Ramirez-Ramirez
description: |-
  It performs the smoothing approach provided by penalized least squares for univariate and bivariate time series, as proposed by Guerrero (2007) and Gerrero et al. (2017).
  This allows to estimate the time series trend by controlling the amount of resulting (joint) smoothness.
