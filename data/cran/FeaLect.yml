title: Scores Features for Feature Selection
maintainer: Habil Zare
description: |-
  For each feature, a score is computed that can be useful
  for feature selection. Several random subsets are sampled from
  the input data and for each random subset, various linear
  models are fitted using lars method. A score is assigned to
  each feature based on the tendency of LASSO in including that
  feature in the models.Finally, the average score and the models
  are returned as the output. The features with relatively low
  scores are recommended to be ignored because they can lead to
  overfitting of the model to the training data. Moreover, for
  each random subset, the best set of features in terms of global
  error is returned. They are useful for applying Bolasso, the
  alternative feature selection method that recommends the
  intersection of features subsets.
