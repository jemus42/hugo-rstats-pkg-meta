title: Analyzing Gene Tree Quartets under the Multi-Species Coalescent
maintainer: John Rhodes
description: |-
  Methods for analyzing and using quartets displayed on a collection of gene trees,
  primarily to make inferences about the species tree or network under the multi-species
  coalescent model. These include quartet hypothesis tests for the model, as developed by
  Mitchell et al. (2019) <doi:10.1214/19-EJS1576>, the species tree inference routines
  based on quartet distances of Rhodes (2019) <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2019.2917204> and
  Yourdkhani and Rhodes (2019), and the NANUQ algorithm for inference of level-1
  species networks of Allman et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.07050>.
