  Yang and Prentice Model with Piecewise Exponential Baseline
  Distribution
maintainer: Fabio Demarqui
description: Semiparametric modeling of lifetime data with crossing survival curves
  via Yang and Prentice model with piecewise exponential baseline distribution. Details
  about the model can be found in Demarqui and Mayrink (2019) <arXiv:1910.02406>.
  Model fitting carried out via likelihood-based and Bayesian approaches. The package
  also provides point and interval estimation for the crossing survival times.
