  Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to
  Vectors)
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: High-performing functions operating on rows and columns of matrices,
  e.g. col / rowMedians(), col / rowRanks(), and col / rowSds().  Functions optimized
  per data type and for subsetted calculations such that both memory usage and processing
  time is minimized.  There are also optimized vector-based methods, e.g. binMeans(),
  madDiff() and weightedMedian().
