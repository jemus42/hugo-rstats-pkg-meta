  Nonparametric Analysis of Bivariate Gap Time with Competing
  Risks
maintainer: Chenguang Wang
description: |-
  For studying recurrent disease and death with competing
  risks, comparisons based on the well-known cumulative incidence function
  can be confounded by different prevalence rates of the competing events.
  Alternatively, comparisons of the conditional distribution of the survival
  time given the failure event type are more relevant for investigating the
  prognosis of different patterns of recurrence disease. This package implements
  a nonparametric estimator for the conditional cumulative incidence function
  and a nonparametric conditional bivariate cumulative incidence function for the
  bivariate gap times proposed in Huang et al. (2016) <doi:10.1111/biom.12494>.
