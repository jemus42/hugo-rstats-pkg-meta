description: |-
  Fitting a principal curve to data lying in the spherical surface.
  This package provides principal circle, principal geodesic analysis, Hauberg's
  principal curves, and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it offers locally
  defined principal geodesics which are currently under study. The detailed procedures
  are described in Jang-Hyun Kim, Jongmin Lee and Hee-Seok Oh (2020) <arXiv:2003.02578>.
