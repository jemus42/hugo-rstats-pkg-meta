title: Create Dendrograms and Tree Diagrams Using 'ggplot2'
maintainer: Andrie de Vries
description: |-
  This is a set of tools for dendrograms and
  tree plots using 'ggplot2'.  The 'ggplot2' philosophy is to
  clearly separate data from the presentation.
  Unfortunately the plot method for dendrograms plots
  directly to a plot device without exposing the data.
  The 'ggdendro' package resolves this by making available
  functions that extract the dendrogram plot data. The package
  provides implementations for tree, rpart, as well as diana and agnes
  cluster diagrams.
