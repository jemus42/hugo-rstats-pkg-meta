  Identification of Dichotomous Differential Item Functioning
  (DIF) using Angoff's Delta Plot Method
maintainer: David Magis
description: The deltaPlotR package implements Angoff's Delta Plot method to detect
  dichotomous DIF. Several detection thresholds are included, either from multivariate
  normality assumption or by prior determination. Item purification is supported (Magis
  and Facon (2014) <doi:10.18637/jss.v059.c01>).
