title: Nonparametric Comparison of Multivariate Samples
maintainer: Amanda Ellis
description: Performs analysis of one-way multivariate data, for small samples using
  Nonparametric techniques. Using approximations for ANOVA Type, Wilks' Lambda, Lawley
  Hotelling, and Bartlett Nanda Pillai Test statics, the package compares the multivariate
  distributions for a single explanatory variable.  The comparison is also performed
  using a permutation test for each of the four test statistics. The package also
  performs an all-subsets algorithm regarding variables and regarding factor levels.
