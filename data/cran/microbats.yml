title: An Implementation of Bat Algorithm in R
maintainer: Seong Hyun Hwang
description: A nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the echolocation behavior
  of microbats that uses frequency tuning to optimize problems in both continuous
  and discrete dimensions. This R package makes it easy to implement the standard
  bat algorithm on any user-supplied function. The algorithm was first developed by
  Xin-She Yang in 2010 (<DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-12538-6_6>, <DOI:10.1109/CINTI.2014.7028669>).
