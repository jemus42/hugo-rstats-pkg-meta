title: Tool for Annotating Images in Preparation for Analysis
maintainer: Stephanie Kobakian
description: |-
  A tool to help create shiny apps for selecting and annotating
  elements of images. Users must supply images, questions, and answer
  choices. The user interface is a dynamic shiny app, that displays the images
  and questions and answer choices. The data generated can be saved to a
  file that can be used for subsequent analysis. The original purpose was to
  annotate still images from tennis video for face recognition and emotion
  detection purposes.
