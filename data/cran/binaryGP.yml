  Fit and Predict a Gaussian Process Model with (Time-Series)
  Binary Response
maintainer: Chih-Li Sung
description: Allows the estimation and prediction for binary Gaussian process model.
  The mean function can be assumed to have time-series structure. The estimation methods
  for the unknown parameters are based on penalized quasi-likelihood/penalized quasi-partial
  likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. The predicted probability and its
  confidence interval are computed by Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. More details
  can be seen in Sung et al (2017) <arXiv:1705.02511>.
