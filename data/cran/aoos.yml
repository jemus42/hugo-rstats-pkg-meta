title: Another Object Orientation System
maintainer: Sebastian Warnholz
description: |-
  Another implementation of object-orientation in R. It provides
  syntactic sugar for the S4 class system and two alternative new
  implementations. One is an experimental version built around S4
  and the other one makes it more convenient to work with lists as objects.
