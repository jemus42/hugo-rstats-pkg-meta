title: |-
  Performs Segmented Linear Regression on Two Independent
  Variables
maintainer: Christoph Luerig
description: |-
  Implements a specific form of segmented linear regression
  with two independent variables. The visualization of that function looks
  like a quarter segment of a cowbell giving the package its name.
  The package has been specifically constructed for the case where minimum
  and maximum value of the dependent and two independent variables
  are known a prior, which is usually the case
  when those values are derived from Likert scales.
