title: Mapping Smoothed Effect Estimates from Individual-Level Data
maintainer: Scott Bartell
description: Contains functions for mapping odds ratios, hazard ratios, or other effect
  estimates using individual-level data such as case-control study data, using generalized
  additive models (GAMs) or Cox models for smoothing with a two-dimensional predictor
  (e.g., geolocation or exposure to chemical mixtures) while adjusting linearly for
  confounding variables, using methods described by Kelsall and Diggle (1998), Webster
  at al. (2006), and Bai et al. (submitted).  Includes convenient functions for mapping
  point estimates and confidence intervals, efficient control sampling, and permutation
  tests for the null hypothesis that the two-dimensional predictor is not associated
  with the outcome variable (adjusting for confounders).
