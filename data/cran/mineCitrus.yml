description: |-
  Citrus is a computational technique developed for the analysis
  of high dimensional cytometry data sets. This package extracts, statistically
  analyzes, and visualizes marker expression from 'citrus' data. This code was used to
  generate data for Figures 3 and 4 in the forthcoming manuscript: Throm et al.
  “Identification of Enhanced Interferon-Gamma Signaling in Polyarticular Juvenile
  Idiopathic Arthritis with Mass Cytometry”, JCI-Insight. For more information on Citrus,
  please see: Bruggner et al. (2014) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1408792111>. To download
  the 'citrus' package, please see <https://github.com/nolanlab/citrus>.
