title: SNP Genotype Marker Design and Analysis
maintainer: Stephen Alfred Sefick
description: 'We implement a common genotyping workflow with a standardized software
  interface. ''genotypeR'' designs genotyping markers from vcf files, outputs markers
  for multiplexing suitability on various platforms (Sequenom and Illumina GoldenGate),
  and provides various QA/QC and analysis functions. We developed this package to
  analyze data in Stevison LS, SA Sefick, CA Rushton, and RM Graze. 2017. Invited

  Transactions Royal Society London B Biol Sci 372:1-14. <DOI:10.1098/rstb.2016.0459>,
