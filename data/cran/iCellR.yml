title: Analyzing High-Throughput Single Cell Sequencing Data
maintainer: Alireza Khodadadi-Jamayran
description: A toolkit that allows scientists to work with data from single cell sequencing
  technologies such as scRNA-seq, scVDJ-seq and CITE-Seq. Single (i) Cell R package
  ('iCellR') provides unprecedented flexibility at every step of the analysis pipeline,
  including normalization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, imputation, visualization,
  and so on. Users can design both unsupervised and supervised models to best suit
  their research. In addition, the toolkit provides 2D and 3D interactive visualizations,
  differential expression analysis, filters based on cells, genes and clusters, data
  merging, normalizing for dropouts, data imputation methods, correcting for batch
  differences, pathway analysis, tools to find marker genes for clusters and conditions,
  predict cell types and pseudotime analysis. See Khodadadi-Jamayran, et al (2020)
  <doi:10.1101/2020.05.05.078550>  and Khodadadi-Jamayran, et al (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.03.31.019109>
