title: Carlson Elliptic Integrals and Incomplete Elliptic Integrals
maintainer: St√©phane Laurent
description: Evaluation of the Carlson elliptic integrals and the incomplete elliptic
  integrals with complex arguments. The implementations use Carlson's algorithms <doi.org/10.1007/BF02198293>.
  Applications of elliptic integrals include probability distributions, geometry,
  physics, mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, astronomy, geodesy,
  geodesics on conics, and magnetic field calculations.
