  Liu, Wynne Hsu,\tYiming Ma (1999) <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3000292.3000305>)
  algorithm for association rule classification (ARC).\nThe package also contains
  several convenience methods that allow to automatically\nset CBA parameters (minimum
  confidence, minimum support) and it also natively\nhandles numeric attributes by
  integrating a pre-discretization step.\nThe rule generation phase is handled by
  the 'arules' package.\nTo further decrease the size of the CBA models produced by
  the 'arc' package, postprocessing by the\n'qCBA' package is suggested."
