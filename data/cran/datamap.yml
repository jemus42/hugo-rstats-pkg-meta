title: A system for mapping foreign objects to R variables and<U+000a>environments
maintainer: Jeffrey Horner
description: datamap utilizes variable bindings and objects of class<U+000a>"UserDefinedDatabase"
  to provide a simple mapping system to<U+000a>foreign objects. Maps can be used as
  environments or attached<U+000a>to the search path, and changes to either are persistent.<U+000a>Mapped
  foreign objects are fetched in real-time and are never<U+000a>cached by the mapping
  system.
