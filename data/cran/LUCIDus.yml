title: Latent Unknown Clustering with Integrated Data
maintainer: Yinqi Zhao
description: |-
  An implementation for the 'LUCID' model (Peng (2019) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz667>) to jointly estimate latent unknown clusters/subgroups with integrated data.
  An EM algorithm is used to obtain the latent cluster assignment and model parameter estimates.
  Feature selection is achieved by applying the L1 regularization method.
