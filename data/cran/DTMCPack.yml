title: Suite of functions related to discrete-time discrete-state<U+000a>Markov Chains
maintainer: William Nicholson<wbnicholson@gmail.com>
description: A series of functions which aid in both simulating and<U+000a>determining
  the properties of finite, discrete-time, discrete<U+000a>state markov chains.  Two
  functions (DTMC, MultDTMC) produce n<U+000a>iterations of a Markov Chain(s) based
  on transition<U+000a>probabilities and an initial distribution.  The function FPTime<U+000a>determines
  the first passage time into each state.  The<U+000a>function statdistr determines
  the stationary distribution of a<U+000a>Markov Chain.
