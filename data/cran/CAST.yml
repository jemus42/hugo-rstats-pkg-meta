title: '''caret'' Applications for Spatial-Temporal Models'
maintainer: Hanna Meyer
description: Supporting functionality to run 'caret' with spatial or spatial-temporal
  data. 'caret' is a frequently used package for model training and prediction using
  machine learning. This package includes functions to improve spatial-temporal modelling
  tasks using 'caret'. It prepares data for Leave-Location-Out and Leave-Time-Out
  cross-validation which are target-oriented validation strategies for spatial-temporal
  models. To decrease overfitting and improve model performances, the package implements
  a forward feature selection that selects suitable predictor variables in view to
  their contribution to the target-oriented performance.
