title: Estimation of the Extremal Index
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Performs frequentist inference for the extremal index of a
  stationary time series.  Two types of methodology are used.  One type is
  based on a model that relates the distribution of block maxima to the
  marginal distribution of series and leads to the semiparametric maxima
  estimators described in Northrop (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10687-015-0221-5> and
  Berghaus and Bucher (2018) <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1621>.  Sliding block maxima
  are used to increase precision of estimation. The other type of methodology
  uses a model for the distribution of threshold inter-exceedance times
  (Ferro and Segers (2003) <doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00401>). Two
  versions of this type of approach are provided, following Suveges (2007)
  <doi:10.1007/s10687-007-0034-2> and Suveges and Davison (2010)
  <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292>.
