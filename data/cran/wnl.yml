  Analysis
maintainer: Kyun-Seop Bae
description: This is a set of minimization tools (maximum likelihood estimation and
  least square fitting) to solve examples in the Johan Gabrielsson and Dan Weiner's
  book "Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications"
  5th ed. (ISBN:9198299107). Examples include linear and nonlinear compartmental model,
  turn-over model, single or multiple dosing bolus/infusion/oral models, allometry,
  toxicokinetics, reversible metabolism, in-vitro/in-vivo extrapolation, enterohepatic
  circulation, metabolite modeling, Emax model, inhibitory model, tolerance model,
  oscillating response model, enantiomer interaction model, effect compartment model,
  drug-drug interaction model, receptor occupancy model, and rebound phenomena model.
