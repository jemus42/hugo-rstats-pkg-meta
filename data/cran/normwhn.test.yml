title: Normality and White Noise Testing
maintainer: Peter Wickham
description: |-
  Includes Omnibus Univariate and Multivariate Normality
  Tests (See Doornik and Hansen (1994)). One variation allows for
  the possibility of weak dependence rather than independence in
  the variable(s). Also included is an univariate white noise
  test where the null hypothesis is "white noise" rather than
  strict "white noise".
