title: Nonlinear Time Series Models with Regime Switching
maintainer: Ho Tsung-wu
description: 'Implements nonlinear autoregressive (AR) time series models. For univariate
  series, a non-parametric approach is available through additive nonlinear AR. Parametric
  modeling and testing for regime switching dynamics is available when the transition
  is either direct (TAR: threshold AR) or smooth (STAR: smooth transition AR, LSTAR).
  For multivariate series, one can estimate a range of TVAR or threshold cointegration
  TVECM models with two or three regimes. Tests can be conducted for TVAR as well
  as for TVECM (Hansen and Seo 2002 and Seo 2006).'
