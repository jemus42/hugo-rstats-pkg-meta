title: Calibration Functions for Analytical Chemistry
maintainer: Johannes Ranke
description: |-
  Simple functions for plotting linear
  calibration functions and estimating standard errors for measurements
  according to the Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics: Part A
  by Massart et al. There are also functions estimating the limit
  of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ).
  The functions work on model objects from - optionally weighted - linear
  regression (lm) or robust linear regression ('rlm' from the 'MASS' package).
