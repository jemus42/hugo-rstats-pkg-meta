description: |-
  Functions used for graphing in multivariate contexts. These
  functions are designed to support produce reasonable graphs with minimal
  input of graphing parameters. The motivation for these functions was to
  support students learning multivariate concepts and R - there may be
  other functions and packages better-suited to practical data analysis. For
  details about the ellipse methods see Johnson and Wichern (2007,
  ISBN:9780131877153).
