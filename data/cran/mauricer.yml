description: |-
  'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2' (<http://www.beast2.org>),
  which, among others, allows one to install 'BEAST2' package.
  This package allows to install 'BEAST2' packages from 'R'.
