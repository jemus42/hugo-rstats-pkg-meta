  Discrete-Time Data
maintainer: Marius Pfeuffer
description: Functions for estimating Markov generator matrices from discrete-time
  observations. The implemented approaches comprise diagonal adjustment, weighted
  adjustment and quasi-optimization of matrix logarithm based candidate solutions,
  an expectation-maximization algorithm as well as a Gibbs sampler.
