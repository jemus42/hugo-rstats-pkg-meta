title: A Cross Between a 2D Density Plot and a Scatter Plot
maintainer: Lukas P. M. Kremer
description: |-
  A cross between a 2D density plot and a scatter plot,
  implemented as a 'ggplot2' geom. Points in the scatter plot are
  colored by the number of neighboring points. This is useful to
  visualize the 2D-distribution of points in case of overplotting.
