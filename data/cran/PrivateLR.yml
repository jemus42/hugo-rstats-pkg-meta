title: Differentially Private Regularized Logistic Regression
maintainer: Staal A. Vinterbo
description: |-
  Implements two differentially private algorithms for
  estimating L2-regularized logistic regression coefficients. A randomized
  algorithm F is epsilon-differentially private (C. Dwork, Differential
  Privacy, ICALP 2006 <DOI:10.1007/11681878_14>), if
  |log(P(F(D) in S)) - log(P(F(D') in S))| <= epsilon
  for any pair D, D' of datasets that differ in exactly one record, any
  measurable set S, and the randomness is taken over the choices F makes.
