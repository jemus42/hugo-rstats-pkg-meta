title: Modeling Earthquake Data Using 'ETAS' Model
maintainer: Abdollah Jalilian
description: |-
  Fits the space-time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence
  ('ETAS') model to earthquake catalogs using a stochastic 'declustering'
  approach. The 'ETAS' model is a 'spatio-temporal' marked point process
  model and a special case of the 'Hawkes' process. The package is based
  on a Fortran program by 'Jiancang Zhuang'
  (available at <http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html>),
  which is modified and translated into C++ and C such that it
  can be called from R. Parallel computing with 'OpenMP' is possible
  on supported platforms.
