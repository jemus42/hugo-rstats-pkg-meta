title: Mediation Analysis of Causality under Confounding
maintainer: Yi Zhao
description: Performs causal mediation analysis under confounding or correlated errors.
  This package includes a single level mediation model, a two-level mediation model,
  and a three-level mediation model for data with hierarchical structures. Under the
  two/three-level mediation model, the correlation parameter is identifiable and is
  estimated based on a hierarchical-likelihood, a marginal-likelihood or a two-stage
  method. See Zhao, Y., & Luo, X. (2014), Estimating Mediation Effects under Correlated
  Errors with an Application to fMRI, <arXiv:1410.7217> for details.
