title: Generalized Polynomial Modelling
maintainer: Mireille Huc
description: |-
  Platform dedicated to the Global Modelling technique. Its aim
  is to obtain ordinary differential equations of polynomial form directly
  from time series. It can be applied to single or multiple time series under
  various conditions of noise, time series lengths, sampling, etc. This platform
  is developped at the Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphere (CESBIO),
  UMR 5126 UPS/CNRS/CNES/IRD, 18 av. Edouard Belin, 31401 TOULOUSE, FRANCE.
  The developments were funded by the French program Les Enveloppes Fluides
  et l'Environnement (LEFE, MANU, projets GloMo, SpatioGloMo and MoMu). The
  French program Defi InFiNiTi (CNRS) and PNTS are also acknowledged (projects
  Crops'IChaos and Musc & SlowFast).
