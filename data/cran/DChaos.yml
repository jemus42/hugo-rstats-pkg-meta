title: Chaotic Time Series Analysis

description: |-
  Chaos theory has been hailed as a revolution of thoughts and attracting ever increasing
  attention of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems are nonlinear deterministic
  dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field
  inside chaos theory and nonlinear time series analysis is the detection of a chaotic behaviour
  from empirical time series data. One of the main features of chaos is the well known initial value
  sensitivity property. Methods and techniques related to test the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify
  the initial value sensitive property estimating the Lyapunov exponents. The DChaos package
  provides different useful tools and efficient algorithms which test robustly the hypothesis of chaos
  based on the Lyapunov exponent in order to know if the data generating process behind time series
  behave chaotically or not.
