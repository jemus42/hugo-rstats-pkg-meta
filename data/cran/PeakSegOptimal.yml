title: Optimal Segmentation Subject to Up-Down Constraints
maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking
description: |-
  Computes optimal changepoint models using the
  Poisson likelihood for non-negative count data,
  subject to the PeakSeg constraint:
  the first change must be up, second change down, third change up, etc.
  For more info about the models and algorithms,
  read "A log-linear time algorithm for constrained changepoint detection"
