title: Extension to 'spatstat' for Large Datasets on a Linear Network
maintainer: Adrian Baddeley
description: |-
  Extension to the 'spatstat' package, for analysing large datasets
  of spatial points on a network. The geometrically-corrected
  K function is computed using the memory-efficient tree-based
  algorithm described by Rakshit, Baddeley and Nair (2019).
