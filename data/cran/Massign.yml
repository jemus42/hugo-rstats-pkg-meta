title: Simple Matrix Construction
maintainer: Erik-Jan van Kesteren
description: |-
  Constructing matrices for quick prototyping can be a nuisance,
  requiring the user to think about how to fill the matrix with values using
  the matrix() function. The %<-% operator solves that issue by allowing the
  user to construct matrices using code that shows the actual matrices.
