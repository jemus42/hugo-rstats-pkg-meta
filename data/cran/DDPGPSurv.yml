title: DDP-GP Survival Analysis
maintainer: William Hua
description: A nonparametric Bayesian approach to survival analysis. The functions
  perform inference via MCMC simulations from the posterior distributions for a Dependent
  Dirichlet Process-Gaussian Process prior. To maximize computational efficiency,
  some of the computations are performed in 'Rcpp'.
