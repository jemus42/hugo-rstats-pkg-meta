title: Simplex Design for Stochastic Simulations and Agent Based Models
maintainer: Kevin R. Quinlan
description: Design statistical experiments on agent based models, including a coordinate
  exchange algorithm for homogeneous agents, and more generally any simplex.  There
  is also an optimization algorithm for the case with multiple classes of homogeneous
  agents. See our paper "Uncertainty Quantification for Models of Homogeneous Agents"
  for more details when it is published.
