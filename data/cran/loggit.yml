version: 2.0.0
title: Modern Logging for the R Ecosystem
maintainer: Ryan Price
description: |2-

  An effortless 'ndjson' (newline-delimited 'JSON') logger, with two primary
  log-writing interfaces. It provides a set of wrappings for base R's
  message(), warning(), and stop() functions that maintain identical
  functionality, but also log the handler message to an 'ndjson' log file.
  'loggit' also exports its internal 'loggit()' function for powerful and
  configurable custom logging. No change in existing code is necessary to use
  this package, and should only require additions to fully leverage the power
  of the logging system. 'loggit' also provides a log reader for reading an
  'ndjson' log file into a data frame, log rotation, and live echo of the
  'ndjson' log messages to terminal 'stdout' for log capture by external
  systems (like containers). 'loggit' is ideal for Shiny apps, data pipelines,
  modeling work flows, and more. Please see the vignettes for detailed example
  use cases.
