title: Calculate the Relative Crystallinity of Starch by XRD and FTIR
maintainer: Claudio Pozo Valenzuela
description: Functions to calculate the relative crystallinity of starch by X-ray
  Diffraction (XRD) and Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Starch is biosynthesized by
  plants in the form of granules semicrystalline. For XRD, the relative crystallinity
  is obtained by separating the crystalline peaks from the amorphous scattering region.
  For FTIR, the relative crystallinity is achieved by setting of a Gaussian holocrystalline-peak
  in the 800-1300 cm-1 region of FTIR spectrum of starch which is divided into amorphous
  region and crystalline region. The relative crystallinity of native starch granules
  varies from 14 of 45 percent. This package was supported by FONDECYT 3150630 and
