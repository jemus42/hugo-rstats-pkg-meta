maintainer: Osman Dag
description: Group method of data handling (GMDH) - type neural network algorithm
  is the heuristic self-organization method for modelling the complex systems. In
  this package, GMDH-type neural network algorithms are applied to make short term
  forecasting for a univariate time series.
