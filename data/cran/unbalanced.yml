title: Racing for Unbalanced Methods Selection
maintainer: Andrea Dal Pozzolo
description: A dataset is said to be unbalanced when the class of interest (minority
  class) is much rarer than normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of missing
  a minority class is typically much higher that missing a majority class. Most learning
  systems are not prepared to cope with unbalanced data and several techniques have
  been proposed. This package implements some of most well-known techniques and propose
  a racing algorithm to select adaptively the most appropriate strategy for a given
  unbalanced task.
