title: An Efficient Swiss Army Knife for Population Genomic Analyses
maintainer: Bastian Pfeifer
description: |-
  Provides efficient tools for population genomics data analysis,
  able to process individual loci, large sets of loci, or whole genomes. PopGenome <DOI:10.1093/molbev/msu136> not only
  implements a wide range of population genetics statistics, but also facilitates the easy
  implementation of new algorithms by other researchers. PopGenome is optimized for speed via
  the seamless integration of C code.
