title: Supervised Cluster Analysis
maintainer: David A. Schoenfeld
description: |-
  Clusters features under the assumption that each cluster has a
  random effect and there is an outcome variable that is related to the random
  effects by a linear regression. In this way the cluster analysis is
  ``supervised'' by the outcome variable. An alternate specification is that
  features in each cluster have the same compound symmetric normal distribution,
  and the conditional distribution of the outcome given the features
  has the same coefficient for each feature in a cluster.
