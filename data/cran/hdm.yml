description: |-
  Implementation of selected high-dimensional statistical and
  econometric methods for estimation and inference. Efficient estimators and
  uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/
  structural parameters are provided which appear in high-dimensional
  approximately sparse models. Including functions for fitting heteroscedastic
  robust Lasso regressions with non-Gaussian errors and for instrumental variable
  (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover,
  the methods enable valid post-selection inference and rely on a theoretically
  grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty.
