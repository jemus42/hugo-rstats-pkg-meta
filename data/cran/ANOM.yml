title: Analysis of Means
maintainer: Philip Pallmann
description: Analysis of means (ANOM) as used in technometrical computing. The package
  takes results from multiple comparisons with the grand mean (obtained with 'multcomp',
  'SimComp', 'nparcomp', or 'MCPAN') or corresponding simultaneous confidence intervals
  as input and produces ANOM decision charts that illustrate which group means deviate
  significantly from the grand mean.
