title: Utility Functions of the Potts Models
maintainer: Dai Feng
description: |-
  There are three sets of functions. The first produces
  basic properties of a graph and generates samples from
  multinomial distributions to facilitate the simulation
  functions (they maybe used for other purposes as well).
  The second provides various simulation functions for a
  Potts model in Potts, R. B. (1952)
  <doi:10.1017/S0305004100027419>.
  The third currently includes only one function which
  computes the normalizing constant of a Potts model
  based on simulation results.
