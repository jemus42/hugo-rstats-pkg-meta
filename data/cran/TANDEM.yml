  A Two-Stage Approach to Maximize Interpretability of Drug
  Response Models Based on Multiple Molecular Data Types
maintainer: Nanne Aben
description: A two-stage regression method that can be used when various input data
  types are correlated, for example gene expression and methylation in drug response
  prediction. In the first stage it uses the upstream features (such as methylation)
  to predict the response variable (such as drug response), and in the second stage
  it uses the downstream features (such as gene expression) to predict the residuals
  of the first stage. In our manuscript (Aben et al., 2016, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw449>),
  we show that using TANDEM prevents the model from being dominated by gene expression
  and that the features selected by TANDEM are more interpretable.
