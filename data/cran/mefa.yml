title: Multivariate Data Handling in Ecology and Biogeography
maintainer: Peter Solymos
description: A framework package aimed to provide standardized computational environment
  for specialist work via object classes to represent the data coded by samples, taxa
  and segments (i.e. subpopulations, repeated measures). It supports easy processing
  of the data along with cross tabulation and relational data tables for samples and
  taxa. An object of class `mefa' is a project specific compendium of the data and
  can be easily used in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction, aggregation,
  conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of `mefa' objects. Reports can be generated
  in plain text or LaTeX format. Vignette contains worked examples.
