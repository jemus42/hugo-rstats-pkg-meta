maintainer: Kilem L. Gwet
description: |-
  Calculates various chance-corrected agreement coefficients (CAC) among 2 or more raters are provided.
  Among the CAC coefficients covered are Cohen's kappa, Conger's kappa, Fleiss' kappa, Brennan-Prediger coefficient, Gwet's AC1/AC2
  coefficients, and Krippendorff's alpha. Multiple sets of weights are proposed for computing weighted analyses. All of these statistical
  procedures are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2014,ISBN:978-0970806284): "Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability," 4th edition,
  Advanced Analytics, LLC.
