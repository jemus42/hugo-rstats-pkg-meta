title: Total Operating Characteristic Curve and ROC Curve
maintainer: Ali Santacruz
description: 'Construction of the Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) Curve and the
  Receiver (aka Relative) Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve for spatial and non-spatial
  data. The TOC method is a modification of the ROC method which measures the ability
  of an index variable to diagnose either presence or absence of a characteristic.
  The diagnosis depends on whether the value of an index variable is above a threshold.
  Each threshold generates a two-by-two contingency table, which contains four entries:
  hits (H), misses (M), false alarms (FA), and correct rejections (CR). While ROC
  shows for each threshold only two ratios, H/(H + M) and FA/(FA + CR), TOC reveals
  the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold (Pontius Jr.,
  R.G., Si, K. 2014. <doi:10.1080/13658816.2013.862623>).'
