title: R Interface to Stan
maintainer: Ben Goodrich
description: |-
  User-facing R functions are provided to parse, compile, test,
  estimate, and analyze Stan models by accessing the header-only Stan library
  provided by the 'StanHeaders' package. The Stan project develops a probabilistic
  programming language that implements full Bayesian statistical inference
  via Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rough Bayesian inference via 'variational'
  approximation, and (optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via
  optimization. In all three cases, automatic differentiation is used to quickly
  and accurately evaluate gradients without burdening the user with the need to
  derive the partial derivatives.
