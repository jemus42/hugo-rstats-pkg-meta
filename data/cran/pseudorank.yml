maintainer: Martin Happ
description: 'Efficient calculation of pseudo-ranks and (pseudo)-rank based test statistics.
  In case of equal sample sizes, pseudo-ranks and mid-ranks are equal. When used for
  inference mid-ranks may lead to paradoxical results. Pseudo-ranks are in general
  not affected by such a problem. For details, see Brunner, E., Bathke A. C. and Konietschke,
  F: Rank- and Pseudo-Rank Procedures in Factorial Designs - Using R and SAS, Springer
  Verlag, to appear.'
