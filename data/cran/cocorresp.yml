maintainer: Gavin L. Simpson
description: Fits predictive and symmetric co-correspondence analysis (CoCA) models
  to relate one data matrix to another data matrix. More specifically, CoCA maximises
  the weighted covariance between the weighted averaged species scores of one community
  and the weighted averaged species scores of another community. CoCA attempts to
  find patterns that are common to both communities.
