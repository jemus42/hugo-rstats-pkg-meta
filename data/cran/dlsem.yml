title: Distributed-Lag Linear Structural Equation Models
maintainer: Alessandro Magrini
description: Inference functionalities for distributed-lag linear structural equation
  models (DLSEMs). DLSEMs are Markovian structural causal models where each factor
  of the joint probability distribution is a distributed-lag linear regression with
  constrained lag shapes (Magrini, 2018 <doi:10.2478/bile-2018-0012>; Magrini et al.,
  2019 <doi:10.1007/s11135-019-00855-z>). DLSEMs account for temporal delays in the
  dependence relationships among the variables through a single parameter per covariate,
  thus allowing to perform dynamic causal inference in a feasible fashion. Endpoint-constrained
  quadratic, quadratic decreasing, linearly decreasing and gamma lag shapes are available.
