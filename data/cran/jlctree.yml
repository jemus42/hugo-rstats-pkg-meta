  Joint Latent Class Trees for Joint Modeling of Time-to-Event and
  Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Ningshan Zhang
description: Implements the tree-based approach to joint modeling of time-to-event
  and longitudinal data. This approach looks for a tree-based partitioning such that
  within each estimated latent class defined by a terminal node, the time-to-event
  and longitudinal responses display a lack of association. See Zhang and Simonoff
  (2018) <arXiv:1812.01774>.
