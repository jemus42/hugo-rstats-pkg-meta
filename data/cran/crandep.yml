title: Network Analysis of Dependencies of CRAN Packages
maintainer: Clement Lee
description: The dependencies of CRAN packages can be analysed in a network fashion.
  Through scrapping the page of a package on CRAN, we can obtain the packages that
  it depends, imports, suggests, etc. By iterating this procedure over a number of
  packages, we can build the dependency network and represent it by a graph object,
  most easily through the 'igraph' package. Subsequently, the dependency network can
  be visualised and analysed using social network analysis methods, enabling us to
  have a bird's-eye view of the CRAN ecosystem.
