title: Informative Gene Selection Tool
maintainer: Nitesh Kumar Sharma
description: Mining informative genes with certain biological meanings are important
  for clinical diagnosis of disease and discovery of disease mechanisms in plants
  and animals. This process involves identification of relevant genes and removal
  of redundant genes as much as possible from a whole gene set. This package selects
  the informative genes related to a specific trait using gene expression dataset.
  These trait specific genes are considered as informative genes. This package returns
  the informative gene set from the high dimensional gene expression data using a
  combination of methods SVM and MRMR (for feature selection) with bootstrapping procedure.
