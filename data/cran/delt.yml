title: Estimation of Multivariate Densities Using Adaptive Partitions
maintainer: Jussi Klemela
description: |2-

  We implement methods for estimating multivariate densities.
  We include a discretized kernel estimator,
  an adaptive histogram (a greedy histogram and a CART-histogram),
  stagewise minimization, and bootstrap aggregation.
