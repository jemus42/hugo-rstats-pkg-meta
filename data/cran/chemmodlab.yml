  A Cheminformatics Modeling Laboratory for Fitting and Assessing
  Machine Learning Models
maintainer: Jeremy Ash
description: |-
  Contains a set of methods for fitting models and methods for
  validating the resulting models. The statistical methodologies comprise
  a comprehensive collection of approaches whose validity and utility have
  been accepted by experts in the Cheminformatics field. As promising new
  methodologies emerge from the statistical and data-mining communities, they
  will be incorporated into the laboratory. These methods are aimed at discovering
  quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). However, the user can
  directly input their own choices of descriptors and responses, so the capability
  for comparing models is effectively unlimited.
