title: Calculation of Sample Size and Power for ICC
maintainer: Alasdair Rathbone
description: |-
  Provides functions to calculate the requisite sample size for studies where ICC is
  the primary outcome. Can also be used for calculation of power. In both cases it
  allows the user to test the impact of changing input variables by calculating the outcome
  for several different values of input variables. Based off the work of Zou.
  Zou, G. Y. (2012). Sample size formulas for estimating intraclass correlation coefficients with
  precision and assurance. Statistics in medicine, 31(29), 3972-3981.
