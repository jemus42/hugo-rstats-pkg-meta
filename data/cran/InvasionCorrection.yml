maintainer: Marcus Rosenblatt
description: The correction is achieved under the assumption that non-migrating cells
  of the essay approximately form a quadratic flow profile due to frictional effects,
  compare law of Hagen-Poiseuille for flow in a tube. The script fits a conical plane
  to give xyz-coordinates of the cells. It outputs the number of migrated cells and
  the new corrected coordinates.
