title: Estimation of Causal Effects with Generalized Additive Models
maintainer: Kevin Quinn
description: |-
  Implements various estimators for average
  treatment effects - an inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator,
  an augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimator, and a standard
  regression estimator - that make use of generalized additive models for
  the treatment assignment model and/or outcome model. See: Glynn, Adam N.
  and Kevin M. Quinn. 2010. "An Introduction to the Augmented Inverse
  Propensity Weighted Estimator." Political Analysis. 18: 36-56.
