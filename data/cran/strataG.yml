title: Summaries and Population Structure Analyses of Genetic Data
maintainer: Eric Archer
description: |-
  A toolkit for analyzing stratified population genetic data.
  Functions are provided for summarizing and checking loci
  (haploid, diploid, and polyploid), single stranded DNA sequences,
  calculating most population subdivision metrics, and running external programs
  such as structure and fastsimcoal. The package is further described in
  Archer et al (2016) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12559>.
