title: '''ggplot2'' Version of "I''m Feeling Lucky!"'
maintainer: Stefan Schroedl
description: |-
  Examines the characteristics of a data frame and a formula to
  automatically choose the most suitable type of plot out of the following supported
  options: scatter, violin, box, bar, density, hexagon bin, spine plot, and
  heat map. The aim of the package is to let the user focus on what to plot,
  rather than on the "how" during exploratory data analysis. It also automates
  handling of observation weights, logarithmic axis scaling, reordering of
  factor levels, and overlaying smoothing curves and median lines. Plots are
  drawn using 'ggplot2'.
