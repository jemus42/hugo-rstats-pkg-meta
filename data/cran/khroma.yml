title: Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization
maintainer: Nicolas Frerebeau
description: |-
  An implementation of Paul Tol's colour schemes for
  use with 'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. These schemes are ready for each
  type of data (qualitative, diverging or sequential), with colours that
  are distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers. This
  package provides tools to simulate colour-blindness and to test how
  well the colours of any palette are identifiable. Several scientific
  thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are
  also implemented.
