  Weighted Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal
  Inference
maintainer: In Song Kim
description: |-
  Provides a computationally efficient way of fitting
  weighted linear fixed effects estimators for causal
  inference with various weighting schemes. Weighted linear
  fixed effects estimators can be used to estimate the
  average treatment effects under different identification
  strategies. This includes stratified randomized
  experiments, matching and stratification for
  observational studies, first differencing, and
  difference-in-differences. The package implements methods
  described in Imai and Kim (2017) "When should We Use
  Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal
  Inference with Longitudinal Data?", available at
  <https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/FEmatch.html>.
