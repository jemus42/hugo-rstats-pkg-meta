title: Causal Inference for Multiple Treatments with a Binary Outcome
maintainer: Jiayi Ji
description: Different methods to conduct causal inference for multiple treatments
  with a binary outcome, including regression adjustment, vector matching, Bayesian
  additive regression trees, targeted maximum likelihood and inverse probability of
  treatment weighting using different generalized propensity score models such as
  multinomial logistic regression, generalized boosted models and super learner. For
  more details, see the paper by Liangyuan Hu (2020) <arXiv:2001.06483> and Jennifer
  L. Hill (2011) <doi:10.1198/jcgs.2010.08162>.
