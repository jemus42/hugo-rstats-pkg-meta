description: |-
  Implementation of the metalog distribution in R.
  The metalog distribution is a modern, highly flexible, data-driven distribution.
  Metalogs are developed by Keelin (2016) <doi:10.1287/deca.2016.0338>.
  This package provides functions to build these distributions from raw data.
  Resulting metalog objects are then useful for exploratory and probabilistic analysis.
