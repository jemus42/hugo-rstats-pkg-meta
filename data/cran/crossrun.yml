title: Joint Distribution of Number of Crossings and Longest Run
maintainer: Tore Wentzel-Larsen
description: |-
  Joint distribution of number of crossings and the
  longest run in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. The
  computations uses an iterative procedure where computations
  are based on results from shorter series. The procedure
  conditions on the start value and partitions by further
  conditioning on the position of the first crossing (or none).
