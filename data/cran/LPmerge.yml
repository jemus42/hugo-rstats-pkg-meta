title: Merging Linkage Maps by Linear Programming
maintainer: Jeffrey Endelman
description: Creates a consensus genetic map by merging linkage maps from different
  populations.  The software uses linear programming (LP) to efficiently minimize
  the mean absolute error between the consensus map and the linkage maps.  This minimization
  is performed subject to linear inequality constraints that ensure the ordering of
  the markers in the linkage maps is preserved.  When marker order is inconsistent
  between linkage maps, a minimum set of ordinal constraints is deleted to resolve
  the conflicts.
