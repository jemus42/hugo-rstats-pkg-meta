title: Compare Two Data Frames and Summarise the Difference
maintainer: Sarah Johnston
description: |-
  Easy comparison of two tabular data
  objects in R. Specifically designed to show differences between two sets of
  data in a useful way that should make it easier to understand the differences,
  and if necessary, help you work out how to remedy them. Aims
  to offer a more useful output than all.equal() when your two data sets do not
  match, but isn't intended to replace all.equal() as a way to test for equality.
