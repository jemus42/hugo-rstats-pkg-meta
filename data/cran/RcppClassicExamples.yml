title: Examples using 'RcppClassic' to Interface R and C++
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The 'Rcpp' package contains a C++ library that facilitates the
  integration of R and C++ in various ways via a rich API. This API was
  preceded by an earlier version which has been deprecated since 2010 (but is
  still supported to provide backwards compatibility in the package
  'RcppClassic').  This package 'RcppClassicExamples' provides usage examples for
  the older, deprecated API. There is also a corresponding package
  'RcppExamples' with examples for the newer, current API which we
  strongly recommend as the basis for all new development.
