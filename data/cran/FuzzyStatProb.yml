  Fuzzy Stationary Probabilities from a Sequence of Observations
  of an Unknown Markov Chain
maintainer: Pablo J. Villacorta
description: |-
  An implementation of a method for computing fuzzy numbers representing stationary probabilities of an unknown Markov chain,
  from which a sequence of observations along time has been obtained. The algorithm is based on the proposal presented by James Buckley
  in his book on Fuzzy probabilities (Springer, 2005), chapter 6. Package 'FuzzyNumbers' is used to represent the output probabilities.
