title: L1-Regularized Multi-State Models
maintainer: Xuan Dang
description: Fitting the regularization path of the L1-regularized multi-state models
  since they can exploit sparsity structure of input. Different tuning regularization
  parameter methods are provided. The cumulative hazard rate estimation and the transition
  probability predictions can be made from the fitted models.
