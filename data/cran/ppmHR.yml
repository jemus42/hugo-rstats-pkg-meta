  Privacy-Protecting Hazard Ratio Estimation in Distributed Data
  Networks
maintainer: Di Shu
description: 'An implementation of the one-step privacy-protecting method for estimating
  the overall and site-specific hazard ratios using inverse probability weighted Cox
  models in distributed data network studies, as proposed by Shu, Yoshida, Fireman,
  and Toh (2019) <doi: 10.1177/0962280219869742>. This method only requires sharing
  of summary-level riskset tables instead of individual-level data. Both the conventional
  inverse probability weights and the stabilized weights are implemented.'
