title: Cross-Validated Area Under the ROC Curve Confidence Intervals
maintainer: Erin LeDell
description: This package contains various tools for working with and evaluating cross-validated
  area under the ROC curve (AUC) estimators.  The primary functions of the package
  are ci.cvAUC and ci.pooled.cvAUC, which report cross-validated AUC and compute confidence
  intervals for cross-validated AUC estimates based on influence curves for i.i.d.
  and pooled repeated measures data, respectively.  One benefit to using influence
  curve based confidence intervals is that they require much less computation time
  than bootstrapping methods.  The utility functions, AUC and cvAUC, are simple wrappers
  for functions from the ROCR package.
