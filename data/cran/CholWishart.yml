title: Cholesky Decomposition of the Wishart Distribution
maintainer: Geoffrey Thompson
description: |-
  Sampling from the Cholesky factorization of a Wishart random
  variable, sampling from the inverse Wishart distribution, sampling from
  the Cholesky factorization of an inverse Wishart random variable, sampling
  from the pseudo Wishart distribution, sampling from the generalized
  inverse Wishart distribution, computing densities for the Wishart
  and inverse Wishart distributions, and computing the multivariate gamma
  and digamma functions. Provides a header file so the C functions can be
  called directly from other programs.
