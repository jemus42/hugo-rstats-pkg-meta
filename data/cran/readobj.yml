title: Fast Reader for 'Wavefront' OBJ 3D Scene Files
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  Wraps 'tiny_obj_loader' C++ library for reading the 'Wavefront' OBJ
  3D file format including both mesh objects and materials files. The
  resultant R objects are either structured to match the 'tiny_obj_loader'
  internal data representation or in a form directly compatible with the 'rgl'
  package.
