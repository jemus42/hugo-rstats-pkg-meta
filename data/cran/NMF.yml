  Algorithms and Framework for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
  (NMF)
maintainer: Nicolas Sauwen
description: |-
  Provides a framework to perform Non-negative Matrix
  Factorization (NMF). The package implements a set of already published algorithms
  and seeding methods, and provides a framework to test, develop and plug
  new/custom algorithms. Most of the built-in algorithms have been optimized
  in C++, and the main interface function provides an easy way of performing
  parallel computations on multicore machines.
