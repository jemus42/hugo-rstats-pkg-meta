title: Design of Portfolio of Stocks to Track an Index
maintainer: Daniel P. Palomar
description: |-
  Computation of sparse portfolios for financial index tracking, i.e., joint
  selection of a subset of the assets that compose the index and computation
  of their relative weights (capital allocation). The level of sparsity of the
  portfolios, i.e., the number of selected assets, is controlled through a
  regularization parameter. Different tracking measures are available, namely,
  the empirical tracking error (ETE), downside risk (DR), Huber empirical
  tracking error (HETE), and Huber downside risk (HDR). See vignette for a
  detailed documentation and comparison, with several illustrative examples.
  The package is based on the paper:
  K. Benidis, Y. Feng, and D. P. Palomar, "Sparse Portfolios for High-Dimensional
  Financial Index Tracking," IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 1,
  pp. 155-170, Jan. 2018. <doi:10.1109/TSP.2017.2762286>.
