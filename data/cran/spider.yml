title: Species Identity and Evolution in R
maintainer: Rupert A. Collins
description: Analysis of species limits and DNA barcoding data. Included are functions
  for generating important summary statistics from DNA barcode data, assessing specimen
  identification efficacy, testing and optimizing divergence threshold limits, assessment
  of diagnostic nucleotides, and calculation of the probability of reciprocal monophyly.
  Additionally, a sliding window function offers opportunities to analyse information
  across a gene, often used for marker design in degraded DNA studies. Further information
  on the package has been published in Brown et al (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.03108.x>.
