title: Download, slice, and normalize GDELT data
maintainer: Stephen R. Haptonstahl
description: |-
  The GDELT data set is over 60 GB now and growing 100 MB a month.
  The number of source articles has increased over time and unevenly across
  countries. This package makes it easy to download a subset of that data,
  then normalize that data to facilitate valid time series analysis.
