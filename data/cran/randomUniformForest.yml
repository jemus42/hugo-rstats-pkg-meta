title: Random Uniform Forests for Classification, Regression and<U+000a>Unsupervised
  Learning
maintainer: Saip Ciss
description: Ensemble model, for classification, regression<U+000a>and unsupervised
  learning, based on a forest of unpruned<U+000a>and randomized binary decision trees.
  Each tree is grown<U+000a>by sampling, with replacement, a set of variables at each
  node.<U+000a>Each cut-point is generated randomly, according to the continuous<U+000a>Uniform
  distribution. For each tree, data are either bootstrapped<U+000a>or subsampled.
  The unsupervised mode introduces clustering, dimension reduction<U+000a>and variable
  importance, using a three-layer engine. Random Uniform Forests are mainly<U+000a>aimed
  to lower correlation between trees (or trees residuals), to provide a deep analysis<U+000a>of
  variable importance and to allow native distributed and incremental learning.
