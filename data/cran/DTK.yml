title: Dunnett-Tukey-Kramer Pairwise Multiple Comparison Test Adjusted<U+000a>for
  Unequal Variances and Unequal Sample Sizes
maintainer: Matthew K. Lau
description: 'This package was created to analyze multi-level one-way<U+000a>experimental
  designs. It is designed to handle vectorized<U+000a>observation and factor data
  where there are unequal sample<U+000a>sizes and population variance homogeneity
  can not be assumed.<U+000a>To conduct the Dunnett modified Tukey-Kramer test (a.k.a.
  the<U+000a>T3 Procedure), create two vectors: one for your observations<U+000a>and
  one for the factor level of each observation. The function,<U+000a>gl.unequal, provides
  a means to more conveniently produce a<U+000a>factor vector with unequal sample
  sizes. Next, use the DTK.test<U+000a>function to conduct the test and save the output
  as an object<U+000a>to input into the DTK.plot function, which produces a<U+000a>confidence
  interval plot for each of the pairwise comparisons.<U+000a>Lastly, the function
  TK.test conducts the original Tukey-Kramer<U+000a>test.'
