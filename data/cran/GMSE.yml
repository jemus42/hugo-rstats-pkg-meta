title: Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation Simulator
maintainer: A. Bradley Duthie
description: |-
  Integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct
  social-ecological models that simulate the management of populations and
  stakeholder actions. These models build off of a previously developed
  management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all aspects of
  management: population dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager
  decision making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The
  newly developed generalised management strategy evaluation (GMSE)
  framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of
  managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, uncertainty, and
  conflict. Simulations can be run using gmse(), gmse_apply(), and
  gmse_gui() functions.
