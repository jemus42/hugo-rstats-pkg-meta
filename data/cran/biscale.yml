version: 0.2.0
title: Tools and Palettes for Bivariate Thematic Mapping
maintainer: Christopher Prener
description: |-
  Provides a 'ggplot2' centric approach to bivariate mapping. This is a
  technique that maps two quantities simultaneously rather than the single value
  that most thematic maps display. The package provides a suite of tools
  for calculating breaks using multiple different approaches, a selection of
  palettes appropriate for bivariate mapping and a scale function for 'ggplot2'
  calls that adds those palettes to maps. A tool for creating bivariate legends
  is also included.
