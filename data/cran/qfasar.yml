  An implementation of Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature
  Analysis (QFASA) in R.  QFASA is a method of estimating the diet
  composition of predators.  The fundamental unit of information in
  QFASA is a fatty acid signature (signature), which is a vector of
  proportions describing the composition of fatty acids within lipids.
  Signature data from at least one predator and from samples of all
  potential prey types are required.  Calibration coefficients, which
  adjust for the differential metabolism of individual fatty acids by
  predators, are also required. Given those data inputs, a predator
  signature is modeled as a mixture of prey signatures and its diet
  estimate is obtained as the mixture that minimizes a measure of
  distance between the observed and modeled signatures.  A variety of
  estimation options and simulation capabilities are implemented.
