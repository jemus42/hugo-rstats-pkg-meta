title: Simulated Sampling Procedure for Community Ecology
maintainer: Edlin Guerra-Castro
description: |-
  Simulation-based sampling protocol (SSP) is an R package design to estimate sampling effort in studies of
  ecological communities based on the definition of pseudo-multivariate standard error (MultSE) (Anderson & Santana-Garcon, 2015) <doi:10.1111/ele.12385> and simulation
  of ecological data. The theoretical background is described in Guerra-Castro et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.03.19.996991>.
