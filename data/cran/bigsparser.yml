version: 0.2.0
title: Sparse Matrix Format with Data on Disk
maintainer: Florian Priv√©
description: |-
  Provides a sparse matrix format with data stored on disk, to be
  used in both R and C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse
  data in C++ and also when parallelizing, since data on disk does not need
  copying. Only a limited number of features will be implemented. For now,
  conversion can be performed from a 'dgCMatrix' of R package 'Matrix'.
