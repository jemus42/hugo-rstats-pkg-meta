  Bessel and Beta Regressions via Expectation-Maximization
  Algorithm for Continuous Bounded Data
maintainer: Vinicius Mayrink
description: Functions to fit, via Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the Bessel
  and Beta regressions to a data set with a bounded continuous response variable.
  The Bessel regression is a new and robust approach proposed in the literature. The
  EM version for the well known Beta regression is another major contribution of this
  package. See the reference Barreto-Souza, Mayrink and Simas (2020) <arXiv:2003.05157>
  for details.
