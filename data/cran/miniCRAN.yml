title: Create a Mini Version of CRAN Containing Only Selected Packages
maintainer: Andrie de Vries
description: |-
  Makes it possible to create an internally consistent
  repository consisting of selected packages from CRAN-like repositories.
  The user specifies a set of desired packages, and 'miniCRAN' recursively
  reads the dependency tree for these packages, then downloads only this
  subset. The user can then install packages from this repository directly,
  rather than from CRAN.  This is useful in production settings, e.g. server
  behind a firewall, or remote locations with slow (or zero) Internet access.
