title: Bias-Corrected Bayesian Classification with Selected Features
maintainer: Longhai Li
description: Fully Bayesian Classification with a subset of high-dimensional features,
  such as expression levels of genes. The data are modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian
  models using heavy-tailed t distributions as priors. When a large number of features
  are available, one may like to select only a subset of features to use, typically
  those features strongly correlated with the response in training cases. Such a feature
  selection procedure is however invalid since the relationship between the response
  and the features has be exaggerated by feature selection. This package provides
  a way to avoid this bias and yield better-calibrated predictions for future cases
  when one uses F-statistic to select features.
