title: Unified Parallel and Distributed Processing in R for Everyone
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: |-
  The purpose of this package is to provide a lightweight and
  unified Future API for sequential and parallel processing of R
  expression via futures.  The simplest way to evaluate an expression
  in parallel is to use `x %<-% { expression }` with `plan(multiprocess)`.
  This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and
  cluster futures.  With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the
  local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed
  on a mix of local and remote machines.
  Extensions to this package implement additional backends for
  processing futures via compute cluster schedulers etc.
  Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order
  switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed
  processing on a remote compute cluster.
  Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions
  are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it
  straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.
