title: Equivalence to control
maintainer: Mario Hasler
description: The package allows selecting those treatments of a one-way layout<U+000a>being
  equivalent to a control. Bonferroni adjusted "two one-sided t-tests"<U+000a>(TOST)
  and related simultaneous confidence intervals are given for both<U+000a>differences
  or ratios of means of normally distributed data. For the case of<U+000a>equal variances
  and balanced sample sizes for the treatment groups, the<U+000a>single-step procedure
  of Bofinger and Bofinger (1995) can be chosen. For<U+000a>non-normal data, the Wilcoxon
  test is applied.
