  Phenotypic analysis of field trials using mixed models with and
  without spatial components. One of a series of statistical genetic packages
  for streamlining the analysis of typical plant breeding experiments developed
  by Biometris.
  Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R
  package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon
  purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r>).
