title: A Bayesian Design for Minimum Effective Dosing-Finding Trial
maintainer: Chia-Wei Hsu
description: The nonparametric two-stage Bayesian adaptive design is a novel phase
  II clinical trial design for finding the minimum effective dose (MinED). This design
  is motivated by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug,
  which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them
  to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. It is used to design single-agent trials.
