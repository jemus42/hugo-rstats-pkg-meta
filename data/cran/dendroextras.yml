title: Extra Functions to Cut, Label and Colour Dendrogram Clusters
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  Provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms
  that build on the base functions provided by the 'stats' package. The main
  functionality it is designed to add is the ability to colour all the edges
  in an object of class 'dendrogram' according to cluster membership i.e. each
  subtree is coloured, not just the terminal leaves. In addition it provides
  some utility functions to cut 'dendrogram' and 'hclust' objects and to
  set/get labels.
