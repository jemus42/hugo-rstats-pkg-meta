title: Read European Eddy Fluxes CSV Files
maintainer: Marco Bascietto
description: The European Eddy Fluxes Database Cluster distributes fluxes of different
  Green House Gases measured mainly using the eddy covariance technique acquired in
  sites involved in EU projects but also single sites in Europe, Africa and others
  continents that decided to share their measurements in the database <http://gaia.agraria.unitus.it>.
  The package provides two functions to load and row-wise bind CSV files distributed
  by the database. Currently only L2, L3, and L4 (L=Level), half-hourly and daily
  (aggregation) files are supported.
