description: Rank-hazard plots Karvanen and Harrell (2009) <DOI:10.1002/sim.3591>
  visualize the relative importance of covariates in a proportional hazards model.
  The key idea is to rank the covariate values and plot the relative hazard as a function
  of ranks scaled to interval [0,1]. The relative hazard is plotted in respect to
  the reference hazard, which can bee.g. the hazard related to the median of the covariate.
