maintainer: Gregory Eady
description: Enables investigation of the predictors of misreporting on sensitive
  survey questions through a multivariate list experiment regression method. The method
  permits researchers to model whether a survey respondent's answer to the sensitive
  item in a list experiment is different from his or her answer to an analogous direct
  question.
