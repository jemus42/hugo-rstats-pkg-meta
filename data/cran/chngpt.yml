title: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing for Threshold Regression
maintainer: Youyi Fong
description: Threshold regression models are also called two-phase regression, broken-stick
  regression, split-point regression, structural change models, and regression kink
  models, with and without interaction terms. Methods for both continuous and discontinuous
  threshold models are included, but the support for the former is much greater. This
  package is described in Fong, Huang, Gilbert and Permar (2017) <DOI:10.1186/s12859-017-1863-x>.
