title: Weighted SVM with boosting algorithm for improving accuracy
maintainer: SungHwan Kim
description: |-
  We propose weighted SVM methods with penalization form. By
  adding weights to loss term, we can build up weighted SVM
  easily and examine classification algorithm properties under
  weighted SVM. Through comparing each of test error rates, we
  conclude that our Weighted SVM with boosting has predominant
  properties than the standard SVM have, as a whole.
