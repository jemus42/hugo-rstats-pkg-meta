title: Summary Measures for Clinical Trials with Survival Outcomes
maintainer: Daewoo Pak
description: |-
  Provides estimates of several summary measures for clinical trials including
  the average hazard ratio, the weighted average hazard ratio, the restricted
  superiority probability ratio, the restricted mean survival difference and
  the ratio of restricted mean times lost, based on the short-term and
  long-term hazard ratio model (Yang, 2005 <doi:10.1093/biomet/92.1.1>)
  which accommodates various non-proportional hazards scenarios. The inference
  procedures and the asymptotic results for the summary measures are discussed
  in Yang (2018, <doi:10.1002/sim.7676>).
