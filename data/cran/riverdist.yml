title: River Network Distance Computation and Applications
maintainer: Matt Tyers
description: |-
  Reads river network shape files and computes network distances.
  Also included are a variety of computation and graphical tools designed
  for fisheries telemetry research, such as minimum home range, kernel density
  estimation, and clustering analysis using empirical k-functions with
  a bootstrap envelope.  Tools are also provided for editing the river
  networks, meaning there is no reliance on external software.
