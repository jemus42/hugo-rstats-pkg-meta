title: Automated Backtesting of Portfolios over Multiple Datasets
maintainer: Daniel P. Palomar
description: |-
  Automated backtesting of multiple portfolios over multiple
  datasets of stock prices in a rolling-window fashion. Intended for
  researchers and practitioners to backtest a set of different portfolios,
  as well as by a course instructor to assess the students in their portfolio
  design in a fully automated and convenient manner, with results conveniently
  formatted in tables and plots. Each portfolio design is easily defined as a
  function that takes as input a window of the stock prices and outputs the
  portfolio weights. Multiple portfolios can be easily specified as a list
  of functions or as files in a folder. Multiple datasets can be conveniently
  extracted randomly from different markets, different time periods, and
  different subsets of the stock universe. The results can be later assessed
  and ranked with tables based on a number of performance criteria (e.g.,
  expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, turnover rate, return
  on investment, computational time, etc.), as well as plotted in a number of
  ways with nice barplots and boxplots.
