title: Mediation Analysis with Missing Data Using Bootstrap
maintainer: Zhiyong Zhang
description: 'Four methods for mediation analysis with missing data: Listwise deletion,
  Pairwise deletion, Multiple imputation, and Two Stage Maximum Likelihood algorithm.
  For MI and TS-ML, auxiliary variables can be included. Bootstrap confidence intervals
  for mediation effects are obtained. The robust method is also implemented for TS-ML.
  Since version 1.4, bmem adds the capability to conduct power analysis for mediation
  models.'
