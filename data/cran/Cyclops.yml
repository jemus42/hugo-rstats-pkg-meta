  Cyclic Coordinate Descent for Logistic, Poisson and Survival
  Analysis
maintainer: Marc A. Suchard
description: |-
  This model fitting tool incorporates cyclic coordinate descent and
  majorization-minimization approaches to fit a variety of regression models
  found in large-scale observational healthcare data.  Implementations focus
  on computational optimization and fine-scale parallelization to yield
  efficient inference in massive datasets.  Please see:
