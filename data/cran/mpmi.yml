title: Mixed-Pair Mutual Information Estimators
maintainer: Chris Pardy
description: |-
  Uses a kernel smoothing approach to calculate Mutual Information
  for comparisons between all types of variables including continuous vs
  continuous, continuous vs discrete and discrete vs discrete. Uses a
  nonparametric bias correction giving Bias Corrected Mutual Information
  (BCMI). Implemented efficiently in Fortran 95 with OpenMP and suited to
  large genomic datasets.
