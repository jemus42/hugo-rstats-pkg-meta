title: Out of Memory Vectors
maintainer: Jan van der Laan
description: |-
  Core functionality for working with vectors (numeric, integer,
  logical and character) that are too large to keep in memory. The vectors are
  kept (partially) on disk using memory mapping. This package contains the
  basic functionality for working with these memory mapped vectors (e.g.
  creating, indexing, ordering and sorting) and provides C++ headers which can
  be used by other packages to extend the functionality provided in this
  package.
