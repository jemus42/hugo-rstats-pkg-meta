title: Clears the Workspace (Mise en Place)
maintainer: Patrick Applegate
description: |-
  Clears the workspace. Useful for the beginnings of R scripts, to
  avoid potential problems with accidentally using information from variables
  or functions from previous script evaluations, too many figure windows open
  at the same time, packages that you don't need any more, or a cluttered
  console.  Uses code from various StackOverflow users.  See help(mise) for
  pointers to the relevant StackOverflow pages.
