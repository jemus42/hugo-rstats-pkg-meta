description: |-
  Extensions to the synthetic controls analyses
  performed by the package 'Synth' as detailed in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2011)
  <doi:10.18637/jss.v042.i13>. Includes generating
  and plotting placebos, post/pre-MSPE (mean squared prediction error)
  significance tests and plots, and calculating average treatment effects
  for multiple treated units. This package represents an implementation of
  those methods suggested in  Abadie, Diamond,and Hainmueller (2010) <doi:10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746> for
  use in synthetic control analysis.
