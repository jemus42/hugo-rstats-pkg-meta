  Distributions for Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale
  and Shape
maintainer: Mikis Stasinopoulos
description: A set of distributions  which can be used  for modelling the response
  variables in Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape, Rigby and
  Stasinopoulos (2005), <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x>. The distributions
  can be continuous, discrete or mixed  distributions.  Extra distributions can be
  created, by transforming, any continuous distribution defined on the real line,  to  a
  distribution defined on ranges 0 to infinity  or  0 to 1,  by using a ''log'' or
  a ''logit' transformation respectively.
