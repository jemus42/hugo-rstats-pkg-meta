title: Call Marker from Snp Data using Binmap
maintainer: Zhougeng Xu
description: |-
  The raw NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) variants called
  from GBS (Genotyping by Sequencing) / WES (Whole Exon Sequencing)/
  WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) may include many error sites. The
  'binmapr' could fix the potential error sites and generate highly
  confident markers for downstream analysis, such as QTL (quantitative
  trait locus) mapping, genetic map construction.
