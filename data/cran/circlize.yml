title: Circular Visualization
maintainer: Zuguang Gu
description: |-
  Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of huge
  amounts of information. Here this package provides an implementation
  of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available
  software. The flexibility of the package is based on the usage of low-level
  graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily
  implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless
  connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R,
  it gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for
  better understanding complex patterns behind multiple dimensional data.
  The package is described in Gu et al. 2014 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu393>.
