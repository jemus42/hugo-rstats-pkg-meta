title: Distributed Model-Based Boosting
maintainer: Ronert Obst
description: |-
  Distributed gradient boosting based on the mboost package. The
  parboost package is designed to scale up component-wise functional
  gradient boosting in a distributed memory environment by splitting the
  observations into disjoint subsets, or alternatively using bootstrap
  samples (bagging). Each cluster node then fits a boosting model to its
  subset of the data. These boosting models are combined in an ensemble,
  either with equal weights, or by fitting a (penalized) regression
  model on the predictions of the individual models on the complete
  data.
