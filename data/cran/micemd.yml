title: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations with Multilevel Data
maintainer: Vincent Audigier
description: Addons for the 'mice' package to perform multiple imputation using chained
  equations with two-level data. Includes imputation methods dedicated to sporadically
  and systematically missing values. Imputation of continuous, binary or count variables
  are available. Following the recommendations of Audigier, V. et al (2018) <doi:10.1214/18-STS646>,
  the choice of the imputation method for each variable can be facilitated by a default
  choice tuned according to the structure of the incomplete dataset. Allows parallel
  calculation and overimputation for 'mice'.
