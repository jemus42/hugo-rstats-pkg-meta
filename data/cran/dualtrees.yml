title: Decimated and Undecimated 2D Complex Dual-Tree Wavelet Transform
maintainer: Sebastian Buschow
description: An implementation of the decimated two-dimensional complex dual-tree
  wavelet transform as described in Kingsbury (1999) <doi:10.1098/rsta.1999.0447>
  and Selesnick et al. (2005) <doi:10.1109/MSP.2005.1550194>. Also includes the undecimated
  version and spectral bias correction described in Nelson et al. (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9784-0>.
  The code is partly based on the 'dtcwt' Python library.
