title: Simple Tools to Compute Landscape Connectivity Metrics
maintainer: Frederico Mestre
description: |-
  Provides functions to upload vectorial data and derive landscape
  connectivity metrics in habitat or matrix systems. Additionally, includes an
  approach to assess individual patch contribution to the overall landscape
  connectivity, enabling the prioritization of habitat patches. The computation
  of landscape connectivity and patch importance are very useful in Landscape
  Ecology research. The metrics available are: number of components, number of
  links, size of the largest component, mean size of components, class coincidence
  probability, landscape coincidence probability, characteristic path length,
  expected cluster size, area-weighted flux and integral index of connectivity.
