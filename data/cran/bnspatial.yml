title: Spatial Implementation of Bayesian Networks and Mapping
maintainer: Dario Masante
description: 'Allows spatial implementation of Bayesian networks and mapping in geographical
  space. It makes maps of expected value (or most likely state) given known and unknown
  conditions, maps of uncertainty measured as coefficient of variation or Shannon
  index (entropy), maps of probability associated to any states of any node of the
  network. Some additional features are provided as well: parallel processing options,
  data discretization routines and function wrappers designed for users with minimal
  knowledge of the R language. Outputs can be exported to any common GIS format.'
