title: Regression with Multiple Change Points
maintainer: Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v
description: Flexible and informed regression with Multiple Change Points (MCP). 'mcp'
  can infer change points in means, variances, autocorrelation structure, and any
  combination of these, as well as the parameters of the segments in between. All
  parameters are estimated with uncertainty and prediction intervals are supported
  - also near the change points. 'mcp' supports hypothesis testing via Savage-Dickey
  density ratio, posterior contrasts, and cross-validation. 'mcp' provides a generalization
  of the approach described in Carlin, Gelfand, & Smith (1992) <doi:10.2307/2347570>
  and Stephens (1994) <doi:10.2307/2986119>.
