title: Robust Periodogram and Periodicity Detection Methods
maintainer: Jonathan Rathjens
description: 'Calculates periodograms based on (robustly) fitting periodic functions
  to light curves (irregularly observed time series, possibly with measurement accuracies,
  occurring in astroparticle physics). Three main functions are included: RobPer()
  calculates the periodogram. Outlying periodogram bars (indicating a period) can
  be detected with betaCvMfit(). Artificial light curves can be generated using the
  function tsgen(). For more details see the corresponding article: Thieler, Fried
  and Rathjens (2016), Journal of Statistical Software 69(9), 1-36, <doi:10.18637/jss.v069.i09>.'
