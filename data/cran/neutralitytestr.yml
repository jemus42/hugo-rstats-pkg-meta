title: Test for a Neutral Evolutionary Model in Cancer Sequencing Data
maintainer: Marc Williams
description: Package takes frequencies of mutations as reported by high throughput
  sequencing data from cancer and fits a theoretical neutral model of tumour evolution.
  Package outputs summary statistics and contains code for plotting the data and model
  fits. See Williams et al 2016 <doi:10.1038/ng.3489> and Williams et al 2017 <doi:10.1101/096305>
  for further details of the method.
