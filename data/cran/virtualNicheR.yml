title: Generating Virtual Fundamental and Realised Niches
maintainer: Thomas R. Etherington
description: |-
  The ability to generate virtual niches enables virtual ecology
  experiments that have been advocated for evaluating species-environment
  relationship models. Using multivariate normal distributions and matrix
  algebra this package provides a unique computational framework to generate
  integrated fundamental and realised niches, which is important given
  differences in possible complexity of realised niche shapes that result
  from biotic interactions Etherington and Omondiagbe (2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01661>.
