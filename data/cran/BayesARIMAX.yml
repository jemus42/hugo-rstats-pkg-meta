title: Bayesian Estimation of ARIMAX Model
maintainer: Achal Lama
description: The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is very popular
  univariate time series model. Its application has been widened by the incorporation
  of exogenous variable(s) (X) in the model and modified as ARIMAX by Bierens (1987)
  <doi:10.1016/0304-4076(87)90086-8>. In this package we estimate the ARIMAX model
  using Bayesian framework.
