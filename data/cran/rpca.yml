  RobustPCA: Decompose a Matrix into Low-Rank and Sparse
  Components
maintainer: Maciek Sykulski
description: Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank
  component and a sparse component. Candes, E. J., Li, X., Ma, Y., & Wright, J. (2011).
  Robust principal component analysis?. Journal of the ACM (JACM), 58(3), 11. prove
  that we can recover each component individually under some suitable assumptions.
  It is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by
  solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among
  all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear
  norm and of the L1 norm. This package implements this decomposition algorithm resulting
  with Robust PCA approach.
