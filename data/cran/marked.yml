title: Mark-Recapture Analysis for Survival and Abundance Estimation
maintainer: Jeff Laake
description: |-
  Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data
  including mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) and multistate models and
  the multi-variate state model structure for survival
  estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance estimation.
  There are also Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and multistate
  models with and without state uncertainty and a simulation capability for HMM
  models.
