  Parametric Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis of Direct and
  Indirect Effects
maintainer: Anita Lindmark
description: We implement functions to estimate and perform sensitivity analysis to
  unobserved confounding of direct and indirect effects introduced in Lindmark, de
  Luna and Eriksson (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7620>. The estimation and sensitivity
  analysis are parametric, based on probit and/or linear regression models. Sensitivity
  analysis is implemented for unobserved confounding of the exposure-mediator, mediator-outcome
  and exposure-outcome relationships.
