title: Leadership-Inference Framework for Multivariate Time Series
maintainer: Chainarong Amornbunchornvej
description: A leadership-inference framework for multivariate time series. The framework
  for multiple-faction-leadership inference from coordinated activities or 'mFLICA'
  uses a notion of a leader as an individual who initiates collective patterns that
  everyone in a group follows. Given a set of time series of individual activities,
  our goal is to identify periods of coordinated activity, find factions of coordination
  if more than one exist, as well as identify leaders of each faction. For each time
  step, the framework infers following relations between individual time series, then
  identifying a leader of each faction whom many individuals follow but it follows
  no one. A faction is defined as a group of individuals that everyone follows the
  same leader. 'mFLICA' reports following relations, leaders of factions, and members
  of each faction for each time step. Please see Chainarong Amornbunchornvej and Tanya
  Berger-Wolf (2018) <doi:10.1137/1.9781611975321.62> when referring to this package
