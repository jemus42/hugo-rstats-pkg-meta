title: Design of Discrete Choice and Conjoint Analysis
maintainer: Jed Stephens
description: Supports designing efficient discrete choice experiments (DCEs). Experimental
  designs can be formed on the basis of orthogonal arrays or search methods for optimal
  designs (Federov or mixed integer programs). Various methods for converting these
  experimental designs into a discrete choice experiment. Many efficiency measures!
