  Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals for (Negative) Likelihood
  Ratio Tests
maintainer: Ari B. Friedman
description: Computes appropriate confidence intervals for the likelihood ratio tests
  commonly used in medicine/epidemiology, using the method of Marill et al. (2015)
  <doi:10.1177/0962280215592907>.  It is particularly useful when the sensitivity
  or specificity in the sample is 100%.  Note that this does not perform the test
  on nested models--for that, see 'epicalc::lrtest'.
