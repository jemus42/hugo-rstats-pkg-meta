  Reproducible and remixable species distribution modelling.
  The package reads user submitted modules from an online repository, runs
  full species distribution modelling workflows and returns output that is
  fully reproducible. For examples and detailed discussion refer to: N.Golding
  et al. (2017) 'The zoon r package for reproducible and shareable species
  distribution modelling'. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
  <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12858>. The package 'SDMTools' is used for testing
  and, though this package is archived, you can access it here if
  needed, <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/SDMTools/>.
