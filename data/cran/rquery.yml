title: Relational Query Generator for Data Manipulation at Scale
maintainer: John Mount
description: |-
  A piped query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
  algebra, and on production experience using 'SQL' and 'dplyr' at big data
  scale.  The design represents an attempt to make 'SQL' more teachable by
  denoting composition by a sequential pipeline notation instead of nested
  queries or functions.   The implementation delivers reliable high
  performance data processing on large data systems such as 'Spark',
  databases, and 'data.table'. Package features include: data processing trees
  or pipelines as observable objects (able to report both columns
  produced and columns used), optimized 'SQL' generation as an explicit
  user visible table modeling step, plus explicit query reasoning and checking.
