title: Permutation Tests for Nonparametric Statistics
maintainer: Steven T. Garren
description: Performs a permutation test on the difference between two location parameters,
  a permutation correlation test, a permutation F-test, the Siegel-Tukey test, a ratio
  mean deviance test.  Also performs some graphing techniques, such as for confidence
  intervals, vector addition, and Fourier analysis; and includes functions related
  to the Laplace (double exponential) and triangular distributions.  Performs power
  calculations for the binomial test.
