  A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests
  and Confidence Intervals in Large Samples
maintainer: Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux
description: |-
  One and two sample mean and variance
  tests (differences and ratios) are considered.
  The test statistics are all expressed in the same
  form as the Student t-test, which facilitates their
  presentation in the classroom. This contribution
  also fills the gap of a robust (to non-normality)
  alternative to the chi-square single variance test
  for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented
  in standard statistical software.
