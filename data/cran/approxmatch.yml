title: Approximately Optimal Fine Balance Matching with Multiple Groups
maintainer: Bikram Karmakar
description: |-
  Tools for constructing a matched design with multiple comparison groups.
  Further specifications of refined covariate balance restriction and exact match on
  covariate can be imposed. Matches are approximately optimal in  the sense that the
  cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal cost, Crama and Spieksma (1992)
