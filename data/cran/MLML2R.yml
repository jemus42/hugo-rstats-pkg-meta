  Maximum Likelihood Estimation of DNA Methylation and
  Hydroxymethylation Proportions
maintainer: Samara Kiihl
description: |-
  Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the proportions
  of 5-mC and 5-hmC in the DNA using information from BS-conversion,
  TAB-conversion, and oxBS-conversion methods. One can use information from all three methods
  or any combination of two of them. Estimates are based on Binomial model by
  Qu et al. (2013) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt459> and
  Kiihl et al. (2019) <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2018-0031>.
