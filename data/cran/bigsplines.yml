title: Smoothing Splines for Large Samples
maintainer: Nathaniel E. Helwig
description: 'Fits smoothing spline regression models using scalable algorithms designed
  for large samples. Seven marginal spline types are supported: linear, cubic, different
  cubic, cubic periodic, cubic thin-plate, ordinal, and nominal. Random effects and
  parametric effects are also supported. Response can be Gaussian or non-Gaussian:
  Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, or Negative Binomial.'
