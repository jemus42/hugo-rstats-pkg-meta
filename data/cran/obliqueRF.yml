title: Oblique Random Forests from Recursive Linear Model Splits
maintainer: D.N. Splitthoff
description: 'Random forest with oblique decision trees for binary<U+000a>classification
  tasks. Discriminative node models in the tree<U+000a>are based on: ridge regression,
  partial least squares<U+000a>regression, logistic regression, linear support vector<U+000a>machines,
  or random coefficients.'
