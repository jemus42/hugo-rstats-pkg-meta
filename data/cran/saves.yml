title: Fast load variables
maintainer: Gergely Dar√≥czi
description: |-
  The purpose of this package is to be able to save and load only
  the needed variables/columns of a dataframe in special binary files (tar
  archives) - which seems to be a lot faster method than loading the whole
  binary object (RData files) via load() function, or than loading columns
  from SQLite/MySQL databases via SQL commands (see vignettes). Performance
  gain on SSD drives is a lot more sensible compared to basic load()
  function. The performance improvement gained by loading only the chosen
  variables in binary format can be useful in some special cases (e.g. where
  merging data tables is not an option and very different datasets are needed
  for reporting), but be sure if using this package that you really need
  this, as non-standard file formats are used!
