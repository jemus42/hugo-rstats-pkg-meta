  Exact Nonparametric Hypothesis Tests for the Mean, Variance and
  Stochastic Inequality
maintainer: Oliver Reiter
description: Provides several novel exact hypothesis tests with minimal assumptions
  on the errors. The tests are exact, meaning that their p-values are correct for
  the given sample sizes (the p-values are not derived from asymptotic analysis).
  The test for stochastic inequality is for ordinal comparisons based on two independent
  samples and requires no assumptions on the errors. The other tests include tests
  for the mean and variance of a single sample and comparing means in independent
  samples. All these tests only require that the data has known bounds (such as percentages
  that lie in [0,100]. These bounds are part of the input.
