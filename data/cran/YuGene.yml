  A Simple Approach to Scale Gene Expression Data Derived from
  Different Platforms for Integrated Analyses
maintainer: Florian Rohart
description: |-
  Simple method for comparison of gene
  expression generated across different experiments, and on
  different platforms; that does not require global
  renormalization, and is not restricted to comparison of
  identical probes. YuGene works on a range of microarray dataset
  distributions, such as between manufacturers. The resulting
  output allows direct comparisons of gene expression between
  experiments and experimental platforms.
