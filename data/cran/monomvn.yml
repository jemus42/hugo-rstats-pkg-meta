title: Estimation for MVN and Student-t Data with Monotone Missingness
maintainer: Robert B. Gramacy
description: |-
  Estimation of multivariate normal (MVN) and student-t data of
  arbitrary dimension where the pattern of missing data is monotone.
  See Pantaleo and Gramacy (2010) <doi:10.1214/10-BA602>.
  Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage regressions
  (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,  etc.), where standard regressions fail,
  the package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount of missing data.
  The current version supports maximum likelihood inference and
  a full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures for Gibbs sampling.
  Monotone data augmentation extends this Bayesian approach to arbitrary
  missingness patterns.  A fully functional standalone interface to the
  Bayesian lasso (from Park & Casella), Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown),
  Horseshoe (from Carvalho, Polson, & Scott), and ridge regression
  with model selection via Reversible Jump, and student-t errors
  (from Geweke) is also provided.
