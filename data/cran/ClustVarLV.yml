title: Clustering of Variables Around Latent Variables
maintainer: Evelyne Vigneau
description: Functions for the clustering of variables around Latent Variables, for
  2-way or 3-way data. Each cluster of variables, which may be defined as a local
  or directional cluster, is associated with a latent variable. External variables
  measured on the same observations or/and additional information on the variables
  can be taken into account. A "noise" cluster or sparse latent variables can also
  be defined.
