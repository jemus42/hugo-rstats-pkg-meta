title: Functions and Methods for Correspondence Regression
maintainer: Koen Plevoets
description: |-
  A collection of tools for correspondence regression, i.e. the
  correspondence analysis of the crosstabulation of a categorical variable Y
  in function of another one X, where X can in turn be made up of the
  combination of various categorical variables. Consequently, correspondence
  regression can be used to analyze the effects for a polytomous or
  multinomial outcome variable.
