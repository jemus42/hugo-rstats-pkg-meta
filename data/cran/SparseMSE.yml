title: '''Multiple Systems Estimation for Sparse Capture Data'''
maintainer: Lax Chan
description: 'Implements the routines and algorithms developed and analysed in "Multiple
  Systems Estimation for Sparse Capture Data: Inferential Challenges when there are
  Non-Overlapping Lists" Chan, L, Silverman, B. W., Vincent, K (2019) <arXiv:1902.05156>.
  This package explicitly handles situations where there are pairs of lists which
  have no observed individuals in common.  It deals correctly with parameters whose
  estimated values can be considered as being negative infinity.  It also addresses
  other possible issues of non-existence and non-identifiability of maximum likelihood
  estimates.'
