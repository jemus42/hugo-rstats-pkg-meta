title: Global Surface Summary of the Day ('GSOD') Weather Data Client
maintainer: Adam Sparks
description: |-
  Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit conversion
  and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day ('GSOD') weather data
  from the from the USA National Centers for Environmental Information
  ('NCEI').  Units are converted from from United States Customary System
  ('USCS') units to International System of Units ('SI').  Stations may be
  individually checked for number of missing days defined by the user, where
  stations with too many missing observations are omitted.  Only stations with
  valid reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final
  data.  Additional useful elements, saturation vapour pressure ('es'), actual
  vapour pressure ('ea') and relative humidity ('RH') are calculated from the
  original data using the improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation (Alduchov
  & Eskridge 1996) and included in the final data set.  The resulting metadata
  include station identification information, country, state, latitude,
  longitude, elevation, weather observations and associated flags.  For
  information on the 'GSOD' data from 'NCEI', please see the 'GSOD'
  'readme.txt' file available from,
