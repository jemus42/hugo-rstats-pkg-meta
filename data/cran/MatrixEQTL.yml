  Matrix eQTL: Ultra Fast eQTL Analysis via Large Matrix
  Operations
maintainer: Andrey A Shabalin
description: |-
  Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets.
  Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype
  and gene expression using linear regression
  with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects.
  The models can include covariates to account for factors
  as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables.
  It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors,
  false discovery rate estimation and
  separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
  For more details see Shabalin (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts163>.
