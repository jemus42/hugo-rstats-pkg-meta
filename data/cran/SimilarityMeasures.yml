title: Trajectory Similarity Measures
maintainer: Kevin Toohey
description: |-
  Functions to run and assist four
  different similarity measures. The similarity
  measures included are: longest common
  subsequence (LCSS), Frechet distance, edit distance
  and dynamic time warping (DTW). Each of these
  similarity measures can be calculated from two
  n-dimensional trajectories, both in matrix form.
