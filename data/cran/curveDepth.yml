title: Tukey Curve Depth and Distance in the Space of Curves
maintainer: Pavlo Mozharovskyi
description: |-
  Data recorded as paths or trajectories may be suitably described
  by curves, which are independent of their parametrization. For the space of
  such curves, the package provides functionalities for reading curves, sampling
  points on curves, calculating distance between curves and for computing Tukey
  curve depth of a curve w.r.t. to a bundle of curves. For details see
  Lafaye De Micheaux, Mozharovskyi, and Vimond (2019) <arXiv:1901.00180>.
