title: Multivariate Normal Distribution Characterization Test
maintainer: William Fairweather
description: |-
  Provides a test of multivariate normality of a sample which does
  not require estimation of the nuisance parameters, the mean and covariance
  matrix.  Rather, a sequence of transformations removes these nuisance
  parameters and results in a set of sample matrices that are positive
  definite.  These matrices are uniformly distributed on the space of positive
  definite matrices in the unit hyperrectangle if and only if the original
  data is multivariate normal. The package performs a goodness of fit test of
  this hypothesis. Four sample datasets are included: a bivariate and a
  trivariate normal set and a bivariate and trivariate Bernoulli set. In
  addition to the test, functions in the package give rotatable visualizations
  of the support region of positive definite matrices for bivariate samples.
