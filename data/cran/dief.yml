title: Metrics for Continuous Efficiency
maintainer: Maribel Acosta
description: An implementation of the metrics dief@t and dief@k to measure the diefficiency
  (or continuous efficiency) of incremental approaches, see Acosta, M., Vidal, M.
  E., & Sure-Vetter, Y. (2017) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_1>. The metrics dief@t
  and dief@k allow for measuring the diefficiency during an elapsed time period t
  or while k answers are produced, respectively. dief@t and dief@k rely on the computation
  of the area under the curve of answer traces, and thus capturing the answer rate
  concentration over a time interval.
