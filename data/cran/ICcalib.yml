title: Cox Model with Interval-Censored Starting Time of a Covariate
maintainer: Daniel Nevo
description: Calibration and risk-set calibration methods for fitting Cox proportional
  hazard model when a binary covariate is measured intermittently. Methods include
  functions to fit calibration models from interval-censored data and modified partial
  likelihood for the proportional hazard model, Nevo et al. (2018+) <arXiv:1801.01529>.
