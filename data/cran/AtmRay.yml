title: Acoustic Traveltime Calculations for 1-D Atmospheric Models
maintainer: Jake Anderson
description: Calculates acoustic traveltimes and ray paths in 1-D,<U+000a>linear atmospheres.  Later
  versions will support arbitrary 1-D<U+000a>atmospheric models, such as radiosonde
  measurements and<U+000a>standard reference atmospheres.
