  Obtain and Analyze Daily Rainfall Data from the USA Climate
  Prediction Center (CPC)
maintainer: Gopi Goteti
description: |-
  The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) rainfall data for the
  world (1979 to present, 50 km resolution) and the USA (1948 to
  present, 25 km resolution), is one of the few high quality, long
  term, observation based, daily rainfall products available for free.
  Although raw data is available at CPC's ftp site, obtaining,
  processing and visualizing the data is not straightforward. There are
  thousands of files, and file formats and file extensions have been
  changing over time. This package provides functionality to download,
  process and visualize over 40 years of global rainfall data and over
  70 years of USA rainfall data from CPC.
