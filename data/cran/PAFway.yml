title: Pairwise Association of Functional Annotations
maintainer: Daphne Ezer
description: |-
  Finds pairs of functional annotations or gene ontology (GO)
  terms that are enriched within a directed network (such as a gene
  regulatory network).  This works with or without edge weights and
  includes visualizations (both as a network where the functions are
  nodes and as a heatmap).  PAFway is an acronym for Pairwise Associations of
  Functional annotations in biological networks and pathWAYs.
