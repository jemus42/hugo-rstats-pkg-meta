title: Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis
maintainer: Justin Kamerman
description: |-
  Accurate estimates of the diets of predators are required
  in many areas of ecology, but for many species current methods are
  imprecise, limited to the last meal, and often biased. The diversity
  of fatty acids and their patterns in organisms, coupled with the
  narrow limitations on their biosynthesis, properties of digestion in
  monogastric animals, and the prevalence of large storage reservoirs of
  lipid in many predators, led us to propose the use of quantitative
  fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) to study predator diets.
