title: Dynamic Network Alignment
maintainer: Ryan Langendorf
description: Functions to take two networks stored as matrices and return a node-level
  injection between them (bijection if the input networks are of the same size). The
  alignment is made by comparing diffusion kernels originating from each node in one
  network to those originating from each node in the other network. This creates a
  cost matrix where rows are nodes from one network and columns are nodes from the
  other network. Optimal node pairings are then found using the Hungarian algorithm.
