title: Tools to Format Numbers for Publication
maintainer: Tyler Rinker
description: |-
  Format numbers and plots for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros,
  standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value formatter. These
  tools combine the functionality of several 'base' functions such as 'paste()',
  'format()', and 'sprintf()' into specific use case functions that are named in a way
  that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to remember and easy to deploy.
