title: Forecast Verification for Extreme Events
maintainer: Maxime Taillardat
description: An index measuring the amount of information brought by forecasts for
  extreme events, subject to calibration, is computed. This index is originally designed
  for weather or climate forecasts, but it may be used in other forecasting contexts.
  This is the implementation of the index in Taillardat et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.04022>.
