  Computing Subscores in Classical Test Theory and Item Response
  Theory
maintainer: Shenghai Dai
description: |-
  Functions for computing subscores for a test using different
  methods in both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). This
  package enables three sets of subscoring methods within the framework of CTT
  and IRT: Wainer's augmentation method, Haberman's three subscoring methods, and
  Yen's objective performance index (OPI). The package also includes the function
  to compute Proportional Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) in Haberman's
  methods which are used to examine whether test subscores are of added value.
