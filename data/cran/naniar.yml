title: Data Structures, Summaries, and Visualisations for Missing Data
maintainer: Nicholas Tierney
description: |-
  Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be explored and
  handled in the initial stages of analysis. 'naniar' provides data structures
  and functions that facilitate the plotting of missing values and examination
  of imputations. This allows missing data dependencies to be explored with
  minimal deviation from the common work patterns of 'ggplot2' and tidy data.
  The work is fully discussed at Tierney & Cook (2018) <arXiv:1809.02264>.
