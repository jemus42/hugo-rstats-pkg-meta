title: Point-Process Response Model for Optogenetics
maintainer: Xi (Rossi) LUO
description: Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been
  genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light.  This package implements
  the methodological framework, Point-process Response model for Optogenetics (PRO),
  for analyzing data from these experiments.  This method provides explicit nonlinear
  transformations to link the flash point-process with the spiking point-process.  Such
  response functions can be used to provide important and interpretable scientific
  insights into the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural spiking
  in response to optogenetic stimulation.
