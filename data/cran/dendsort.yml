title: Modular Leaf Ordering Methods for Dendrogram Nodes
maintainer: Ryo Sakai
description: |-
  An implementation of functions to optimize ordering of nodes in
  a dendrogram, without affecting the meaning of the dendrogram. A dendrogram can
  be sorted based on the average distance of subtrees, or based on the smallest
  distance value. These sorting methods improve readability and interpretability
  of tree structure, especially for tasks such as comparison of different distance
  measures or linkage types and identification of tight clusters and outliers. As
  a result, it also introduces more meaningful reordering for a coupled heatmap
  visualization.
