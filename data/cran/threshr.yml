title: Threshold Selection and Uncertainty for Extreme Value Analysis
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Provides functions for the selection of thresholds for use in
  extreme value models, based mainly on the methodology in
  Northrop, Attalides and Jonathan (2017) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12159>.
  It also performs predictive inferences about future extreme values,
  based either on a single threshold or on a weighted average of inferences
  from multiple thresholds, using the 'revdbayes' package
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=revdbayes>.
  At the moment only the case where the data can be treated as
  independent identically distributed observations is considered.
