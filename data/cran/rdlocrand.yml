title: Local Randomization Methods for RD Designs
maintainer: Gonzalo Vazquez-Bare
description: 'The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental
  design for causal inference and policy evaluation. Under the local randomization
  approach, RD designs can be interpreted as randomized experiments inside a window
  around the cutoff. This package provides tools to perform randomization inference
  for RD designs under local randomization: rdrandinf() to perform hypothesis testing
  using randomization inference, rdwinselect() to select a window around the cutoff
  in which randomization is likely to hold, rdsensitivity() to assess the sensitivity
  of the results to different window lengths and null hypotheses and rdrbounds() to
  construct Rosenbaum bounds for sensitivity to unobserved confounders. See Cattaneo,
  Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2016) <https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdlocrand/Cattaneo-Titiunik-VazquezBare_2016_Stata.pdf>
  for further methodological details.'
