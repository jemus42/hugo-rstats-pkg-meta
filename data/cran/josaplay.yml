title: Add Josa Based on Previous Letter in Korean
maintainer: Chanyub Park
description: |-
  Josa in Korean is often determined by judging the previous word.
  When writing reports using Rmd, a function that prints the
  appropriate investigation for each case is helpful.
  The 'josaplay' package then evaluates the previous word
  to determine which josa is appropriate.
