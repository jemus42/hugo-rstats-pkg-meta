title: Allele Frequency Comparison
maintainer: Khalid B. Kunji
description: |-
  When doing association analysis one does not always have the
  genotypes for the control population.  In such cases it may be
  necessary to fall back on frequency based tests using well known sources
  for the frequencies in the control population, for instance, from the
  1000 Genomes Project.  The Allele Frequency Comparison ('AssocAFC') package
  performs multiple rare variant association analyses in both population and
  family-based GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) designs. It includes
  three score tests that are based on the difference of the sum of allele
  frequencies between cases and controls.  Two of these tests, Wcorrected()
  and Wqls(), are collapsing-based tests and suffer from having protective
  and risk variants. The third test, afcSKAT(), is a score test that
  overcomes the mix of SNP (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) effect
  directions. For more details see
