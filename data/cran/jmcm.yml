title: Joint Mean-Covariance Models using 'Armadillo' and S4
maintainer: Jianxin Pan
description: |-
  Fit joint mean-covariance models for longitudinal data. The models
  and their components are represented using S4 classes and methods. The core
  computational algorithms are implemented using the 'Armadillo' C++ library
  for numerical linear algebra and 'RcppArmadillo' glue.
