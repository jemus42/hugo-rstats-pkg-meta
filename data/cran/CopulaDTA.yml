description: |-
  Modelling of sensitivity and specificity on their natural scale
  using copula based bivariate beta-binomial distribution to yield marginal
  mean sensitivity and specificity. The intrinsic negative correlation between
  sensitivity and specificity is modelled using a copula function. A forest plot
  can be obtained for categorical covariates or for the model with intercept only.
