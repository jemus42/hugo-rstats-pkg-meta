title: Import from and Export to Amiga Disk Files
maintainer: Pepijn de Vries
description: |-
  Amiga Disk Files (ADF) are virtual
  representations of 3.5 inch floppy disks for the
  Commodore Amiga. Most disk drives from other systems
  (including modern drives) are not able to read these
  disks. To be able to emulate this system, the ADF
  format was created. This package enables you to read
  ADF files and import and export files from and to such
  virtual DOS-formatted disks.
