title: Robust P-Value Combination Methods
maintainer: Sora Yoon
description: The meta-analysis is performed to increase the statistical power by integrating
  the results from several experiments. The p-values are often combined in meta-analysis
  when the effect sizes are not available. The 'metapro' R package provides not only
  traditional methods (Becker BJ (1994, ISBN:0-87154-226-9), Mosteller, F. & Bush,
  R.R. (1954, ISBN:0201048523) and Lancaster HO (1949, ISSN:00063444)), but also new
  methods such as weighted Fisher’s method and ordmeta we developed. While the (weighted)
  Z-method is suitable for finding features effective in most experiments, (weighted)
  Fisher’s method and ordmeta are useful for detecting partially associated features.
  Thus, the users can choose the function based on their purpose.
