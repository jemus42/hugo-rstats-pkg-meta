  Inference of Chromosome-Length Haplotypes Using Genomic Data of
  Single Gamete Cells
maintainer: Ruidong Li
description: |-
  Inference of chromosome-length haplotypes using a few haploid
  gametes of an individual. The gamete genotype data may be generated from various platforms
  including genotyping arrays and sequencing even with low-coverage. Hapi simply takes
  genotype data of known hetSNPs in single gamete cells as input and report the high-resolution
  haplotypes as well as confidence of each phased hetSNPs. The package also includes a module
  allowing downstream analyses and visualization of identified crossovers in the gametes.
