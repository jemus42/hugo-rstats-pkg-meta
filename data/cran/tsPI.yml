description: |-
  Prediction intervals for ARIMA and structural time series
  models using importance sampling approach with uninformative priors for model
  parameters, leading to more accurate coverage probabilities in frequentist
  sense. Instead of sampling the future observations and hidden states of the
  state space representation of the model, only model parameters are sampled,
  and the method is based solving the equations corresponding to the conditional
  coverage probability of the prediction intervals. This makes method relatively
  fast compared to for example MCMC methods, and standard errors of prediction
  limits can also be computed straightforwardly.
