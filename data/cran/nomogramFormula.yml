title: Calculate Total Points and Probabilities for Nomogram
maintainer: Jing Zhang<zj391120@163.com>
description: |2-

  A nomogram, which can be carried out in 'rms' package, provides a
  graphical explanation of a prediction process. However, it is not very easy
  to draw straight lines, read points and probabilities accurately. Even, it
  is hard for users to calculate total points and probabilities for all
  subjects.
  This package provides formula_rd() and formula_lp() functions to fit the
  formula of total points with raw data and linear predictors respectively by
  polynomial regression. Function points_cal() will help you calculate the
  total points. prob_cal() can be used to calculate the probabilities after
  lrm(), cph() or psm() regression.
  For more complex condition, interaction or restricted cubic spine, TotalPoints.rms()
  can be used.
