title: Planning, Conducting, and Analysing Single-Arm Phase II Studies
maintainer: Johannes Krisam
description: |-
  Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate
  oncological phase II studies. In general this kind of studies are single-arm
  trials with planned interim analysis and binary endpoint. To meet the resulting
  requirements, the package provides functions to calculate and evaluate 'Simon's
  two-stage designs' and 'so-called' 'subset designs'. If you are unfamiliar with
  this package a good starting point is to take a closer look at the functions
  getSolutions() and getSolutionsSub1().The web-based tool (<https://imbi.shinyapps.io/phaseII-app/>)
  extends the functionality of our R package by means of a proper dealing with over- and underrunning.
  The R function binom.test of the 'stats' R package and the package 'binom' might be
  helpful to assess the performance of the corresponding one-stage design as a reference.
