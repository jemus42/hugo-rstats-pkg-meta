title: Bayesian Dynamical System Model
maintainer: Viktoria Spaiser
description: The package bdynsys for panel/longitudinal data combines methods to model<U+000a>changes
  in up to four indicators over times as a function of the indicators<U+000a>themselves
  and up to three predictors using ordinary differential equations<U+000a>(ODEs) with
  polynomial terms that allow to model complex and nonlinear<U+000a>effects. A Bayesian
  model selection approach is implemented. The package<U+000a>provides also visualisation
  tools to plot phase portraits of the dynamic<U+000a>system, showing the complex
  co-evolution of two indicators over time with the<U+000a>possibility to highlight
  trajectories for specified entities (e.g. countries,<U+000a>individuals). Furthermore
  the visualisation tools allow for making<U+000a>predictions of the trajectories
  of specified entities with respect to the<U+000a>indicators.
