title: Create American Psychological Association (APA) Style Tables
maintainer: David Stanley
description: |-
  A common task faced by researchers is the creation of APA style
  (i.e., American Psychological Association style) tables from statistical
  output. In R a large number of function calls are often needed to obtain all of
  the desired information for a single APA style table. As well, the process of
  manually creating APA style tables in a word processor is prone to transcription
  errors. This package creates Word files (.doc files) containing APA style tables
  for several types of analyses. Using this package minimizes transcription errors
  and reduces the number commands needed by the user.
