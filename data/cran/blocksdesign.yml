  Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial and Unstructured
  Treatment Sets
maintainer: Rodney Edmondson
description: |-
  Constructs D-optimal or near D-optimal treatment and block designs for linear
  treatment models with crossed or nested block factors. The treatment design can be any
  arbitrary linear model defined by a treatment model formula and the block design can be
  any feasible combination of crossed or nested block factors. The block design factors
  are optimized sequentially and the levels of each successive block factor are optimized
  within the levels of each preceding block factor. Crossed block designs with non-singular
  interaction effects are optimized using a weighting scheme that allows for differential
  weighting of first and second-order block effects. Outputs include a table showing the
  allocation of treatments to blocks and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors
  for each block and treatment design.
