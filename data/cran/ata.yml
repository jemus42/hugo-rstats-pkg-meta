version: 1.1.0
title: Automated Test Assembly
maintainer: Michael Chajewski
description: |-
  Provides a collection of psychometric methods to process item metadata
  and use target assessment and measurement blueprint constraints to assemble a test form. Currently two automatic
  test assembly (ata) approaches are enabled. For example, the weighted (positive) deviations method, wdm(), proposed
  by Swanson and Stocking (1993) <doi:10.1177/014662169301700205> was implemented in its full specification allowing
  for both item selection as well as test form refinement. The linear constraint programming approach, atalp(), uses the
  linear equation solver by Berkelaar et. al (2014) <http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/>
  to enable a variety of approaches to select items.
