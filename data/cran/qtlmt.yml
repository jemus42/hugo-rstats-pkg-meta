title: Tools for Mapping Multiple Complex Traits
maintainer: Riyan Cheng
description: Provides tools for joint analysis of multiple traits in a backcross (BC)
  or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population. It can be used to select an optimal
  subset of traits for multiple-trait mapping, analyze multiple traits via the SURE
  model, which can associate different QTL with different traits, and perform multiple-trait
  composite multiple-interval mapping.
