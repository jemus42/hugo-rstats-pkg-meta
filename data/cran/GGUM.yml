title: Generalized Graded Unfolding Model
maintainer: Jorge N. Tendeiro
description: An implementation of the generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM) in
  R, see Roberts, Donoghue, and Laughlin (2000) <doi:10.1177/01466216000241001>).
  It allows to simulate data sets based on the GGUM. It fits the GGUM and the GUM,
  and it retrieves item and person parameter estimates. Several plotting functions
  are available (item and test information functions; item and test characteristic
  curves; item category response curves). Additionally, there are some functions that
  facilitate the communication between R and 'GGUM2004'. Finally, a model-fit checking
  utility, MODFIT(), is also available.
