description: |-
  SaTScan(TM) (http://www.satscan.org) is software for finding regions in
  Time, Space, or Time-Space that have excess risk, based on scan statistics, and
  uses Monte Carlo hypothesis testing to generate P-values for these regions.  The
  rsatscan package provides functions for writing R data frames in
  SaTScan-readable formats, for setting SaTScan parameters, for running SaTScan in
  the OS, and for reading the files that SaTScan creates.
