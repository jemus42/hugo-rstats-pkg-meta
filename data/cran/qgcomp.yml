title: Quantile G-Computation
maintainer: Alexander Keil
description: |-
  G-computation for a set of time-fixed exposures
  with quantile-based basis functions, possibly under linearity and
  homogeneity assumptions. This approach estimates a regression line
  corresponding to the expected change in the outcome (on the link
  basis) given a simultaneous increase in the quantile-based category
  for all exposures. Works with continuous, binary, and right-censored
  time-to-event outcomes.  Reference: Alexander P. Keil, Jessie P.
  Buckley, Katie M. OBrien, Kelly K. Ferguson, Shanshan Zhao, and
  Alexandra J. White (2019) A quantile-based g-computation approach to
  addressing the effects of exposure mixtures; <doi:10.1289/EHP5838>.
