title: Combine Multidimensional Arrays
maintainer: Tony Plate
description: |-
  Combine multidimensional arrays into a single array.
  This is a generalization of 'cbind' and 'rbind'.  Works with
  vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays.  Also
  provides functions 'adrop', 'asub', and 'afill' for manipulating,
  extracting and replacing data in arrays.
