title: Reliable Comparison of Floating Point Numbers
maintainer: Alex M Chubaty
description: |-
  Comparisons of floating point numbers are problematic due to errors
  associated with the binary representation of decimal numbers.
  Despite being aware of these problems, people still use numerical methods
  that fail to account for these and other rounding errors (this pitfall is
  the first to be highlighted in Circle 1 of Burns (2012)
  'The R Inferno' <http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf>).
  This package provides new relational operators useful for performing
  floating point number comparisons with a set tolerance.
