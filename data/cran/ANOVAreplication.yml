title: Test ANOVA Replications by Means of the Prior Predictive p-Value
maintainer: M.A.J. Zondervan-Zwijnenburg
description: Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to test replication
  of relevant features of original ANOVA studies. Relevant features are captured in
  informative hypotheses. The package also allows for the computation of sample sizes
  for new studies, post-hoc power calculations, and comes with a Shiny application
  in which all calculations can be conducted as well. The statistical underpinnings
  are described in Zondervan-Zwijnenburg (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/6myqh>.
