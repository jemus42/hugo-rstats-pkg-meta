title: Entropy-Based Segregation Indices
maintainer: Benjamin Elbers
description: |-
  Computes entropy-based segregation indices, as developed by
  Theil (1971) <isbn:978-0471858454>, with a focus on
  the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Information Index (H).
  The M, further described by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01237.x>
  and Frankel and Volij (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.008>,
  is a measure of segregation that is highly decomposable. The package provides
  tools to decompose the index by units and groups (local segregation),
  and by within and between terms.
  Includes standard error estimation by bootstrapping.
