  Fitting Linear Models with Endogenous Regressors using Latent
  Instrumental Variables
maintainer: Raluca Gui
description: |-
  Fits linear models with endogenous regressor using latent instrumental variable approaches.
  The methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997) <doi:10.2307/2171884> higher moments approach as well as
  Lewbel's (2012) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2012.643126> heteroscedasticity approach, Park and Gupta's (2012) <doi:10.1287/mksc.1120.0718> joint estimation method
  that uses Gaussian copula and Kim and Frees's (2007) <doi:10.1007/s11336-007-9008-1> multilevel generalized
  method of moment approach that deals with endogeneity in a multilevel setting.
  These are statistical techniques to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables are needed.
  Note that with version 2.0.0 sweeping changes were introduced which greatly improve functionality and usability but break backwards compatibility.
