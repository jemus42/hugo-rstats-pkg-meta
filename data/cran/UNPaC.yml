  Non-Parametric Cluster Significance Testing with Reference to a
  Unimodal Null Distribution
maintainer: Erika S. Helgeson
description: Assess the significance of identified clusters and estimates the true
  number of clusters by comparing the explained variation due to the clustering from
  the original data to that produced by clustering a unimodal reference distribution
  which preserves the covariance structure in the data. The reference distribution
  is generated using kernel density estimation and a Gaussian copula framework. A
  dimension reduction strategy and sparse covariance estimation optimize this method
  for the high-dimensional, low-sample size setting. This method is similar to them
  method described in Helgeson and Bair (2016) <arXiv:1610.01424> except a Gaussian
  copula approach is used to account for feature correlation.
