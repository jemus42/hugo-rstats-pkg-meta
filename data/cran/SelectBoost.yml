  A General Algorithm to Enhance the Performance of Variable
  Selection Methods in Correlated Datasets
maintainer: Frederic Bertrand
description: An implementation of the selectboost algorithm (Bertrand et al. 2020,
  <arXiv:1810.01670>), which is a general algorithm that improves the precision of
  any existing variable selection method. This algorithm is based on highly intensive
  simulations and takes into account the correlation structure of the data. It can
  either produce a confidence index for variable selection or it can be used in an
  experimental design planning perspective.
