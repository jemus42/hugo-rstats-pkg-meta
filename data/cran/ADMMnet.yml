title: Regularized Model with Selecting the Number of Non-Zeros
maintainer: Xiang Li
description: Fit linear and cox models regularized with net (L1 and Laplacian), elastic-net
  (L1 and L2) or lasso (L1) penalty, and their adaptive forms, such as adaptive lasso
  and net adjusting for signs of linked coefficients. In addition, it treats the number
  of non-zero coefficients as another tuning parameter and simultaneously selects
  with the regularization parameter. The package uses one-step coordinate descent
  algorithm and runs extremely fast by taking into account the sparsity structure
  of coefficients.
