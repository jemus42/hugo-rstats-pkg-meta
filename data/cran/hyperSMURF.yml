title: Hyper-Ensemble Smote Undersampled Random Forests
maintainer: Giorgio Valentini
description: Machine learning supervised method to learn rare genomic features in
  imbalanced genetic data sets. This method can be also applied to classify or rank
  examples characterized by a high imbalance between the minority and majority class.
  hyperSMURF adopts a hyper-ensemble (ensemble of ensembles) approach, undersampling
  of the majority class and oversampling of the minority class to learn highly imbalanced
  data.
