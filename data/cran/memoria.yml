  Quantifying Ecological Memory in Palaeoecological Datasets and
  Other Long Time-Series
maintainer: Blas M. Benito
description: Tools to quantify ecological memory in long time-series with Random Forest
  models (Breiman 2001 <doi:10.1023/A:1010933404324>) fitted with the 'ranger' library
  (Wright and Ziegler 2017 <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>). Particularly oriented to
  palaeoecological datasets and simulated pollen curves produced by the 'virtualPollen'
  package, but also applicable to other long time-series involving a set of environmental
  drivers and a biotic response.
