description: |-
  'Slack' <http://slack.com/> provides a service for teams to
  collaborate by sharing messages, images, links, files and more. Functions are provided
  that make it possible to interact with the 'Slack' platform 'API'. When
  you need to share information or data from R, rather than resort to copy/
  paste in e-mails or other services like 'Skype' <http://www.skype.com/>, you
  can use this package to send well-formatted output from multiple R objects and
  expressions to all teammates at the same time with little effort. You can also
  send images from the current graphics device, R objects, and upload files.
