title: Adapted Pair Correlation Function
maintainer: Robert Nuske
description: |-
  The adapted pair correlation function transfers the concept of the
  pair correlation function from point patterns to patterns of objects of
  finite size and irregular shape (e.g. lakes within a country). This is a
  reimplementation of the method suggested by Nuske et al. (2009)
  <doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2009.09.050> using the libraries 'GEOS' and 'GDAL'
  directly instead of through 'PostGIS'.
