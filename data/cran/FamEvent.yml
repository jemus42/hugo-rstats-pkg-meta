title: Family Age-at-Onset Data Simulation and Penetrance Estimation
maintainer: Yun-Hee Choi
description: |-
  Simulates age-at-onset traits associated with a segregating major gene in family data
  obtained from population-based, clinic-based, or multi-stage designs. Appropriate ascertainment
  correction is utilized to estimate age-dependent penetrance functions either parametrically from
  the fitted model or nonparametrically from the data. The Expectation and Maximization algorithm
  can infer missing genotypes and carrier probabilities estimated from family's genotype and
  phenotype information or from a fitted model. Plot functions include pedigrees of simulated
  families and predicted penetrance curves based on specified parameter values.
