  Sample Size and Power for Comparing Inequality Constrained
  Hypotheses
maintainer: Fayette Klaassen
description: |-
  A collection of methods to determine the required sample size for
  the evaluation of inequality constrained hypotheses by means of a Bayes
  factor. Alternatively, for a given sample size, the unconditional error
  probabilities or the expected conditional error probabilities can be
  determined. Additional material on the methods in this package is
  available in Klaassen, F., Hoijtink, H. & Gu, X. (2019)
