title: Quantile Regression for Linear Mixed-Effects Models
maintainer: Christian E. Galarza
description: |-
  Quantile regression (QR) for Linear
  Mixed-Effects Models via the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD).
  It uses the Stochastic Approximation of the EM (SAEM) algorithm for
  deriving exact maximum likelihood estimates and full inference results
  for the fixed-effects and variance components.
  It also provides graphical summaries for assessing the algorithm
  convergence and fitting results.
