title: Visualize Draws from the Prior and Posterior Distributions
maintainer: Ignacio Martinez
description: |-
  Interactive visualization for Bayesian prior and posterior distributions.
  When both distributions are provided the animation shows a transition from
  prior to posterior. Finally, the animation splits the distribution using the provided
  'breaks' into bars that show the probability for each region.
  If no 'breaks' are providers it will use zero by default.
