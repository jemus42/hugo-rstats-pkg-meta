title: Flexible Parametric Survival and Multi-State Models
maintainer: Christopher Jackson
description: |-
  Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data,
  including the Royston-Parmar spline model, generalized gamma and
  generalized F distributions.  Any user-defined parametric
  distribution can be fitted, given at least an R function defining
  the probability density or hazard. There are also tools for
  fitting and predicting from fully parametric multi-state models.
