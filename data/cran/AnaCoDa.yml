  Analysis of Codon Data under Stationarity using a Bayesian
  Framework
maintainer: Cedric Landerer
description: |-
  Is a collection of models to analyze genome scale codon
  data using a Bayesian framework. Provides visualization
  routines and checkpointing for model fittings. Currently
  published models to analyze gene data for selection on codon
  usage based on Ribosome Overhead Cost (ROC) are: ROC (Gilchrist
  et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evv087>), and ROC with phi
  (Wallace & Drummond (2013) <doi:10.1093/molbev/mst051>). In
  addition 'AnaCoDa' contains three currently unpublished models.
  The FONSE (First order approximation On NonSense Error) model
  analyzes gene data for selection on codon usage against of
  nonsense error rates. The PA (PAusing time) and PANSE (PAusing
  time + NonSense Error) models use ribosome footprinting data to
  analyze estimate ribosome pausing times with and without
  nonsense error rate from ribosome footprinting data.
