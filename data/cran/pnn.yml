description: |-
  The program pnn implements the algorithm proposed by
  Specht (1990).  It is written in the R statistical language. It
  solves a common problem in automatic learning. Knowing a set of
  observations described by a vector of quantitative variables,
  we classify them in a given number of groups. Then, the
  algorithm is trained with this datasets and should guess
  afterwards the group of any new observation. This neural
  network has the main advantage to begin generalization
  instantaneously even with a small set of known observations. It
  is delivered with four functions (learn, smooth, perf and
  guess) and a dataset. The functions are documented with
  examples and provided with unit tests.
