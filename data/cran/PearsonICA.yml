  Independent component analysis using score functions from the
  Pearson system
maintainer: Juha Karvanen
description: |-
  The Pearson-ICA algorithm is a mutual information-based
  method for blind separation of statistically independent source
  signals. It has been shown that the minimization of mutual
  information leads to iterative use of score functions, i.e.
  derivatives of log densities. The Pearson system allows
  adaptive modeling of score functions. The flexibility of the
  Pearson system makes it possible to model a wide range of
  source distributions including asymmetric distributions. The
  algorithm is designed especially for problems with asymmetric
  sources but it works for symmetric sources as well.
