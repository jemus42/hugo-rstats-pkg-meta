title: MCMC Sampling of Bayesian Linear Models via Summary Statistics
maintainer: Evgeny Savel'ev
description: 'Methods for generating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior samples
  of Bayesian linear regression model parameters that require only summary statistics
  of data as input. Summary statistics are useful for systems with very limited amounts
  of physical memory. The package provides two functions:  one function that computes
  summary statistics of data and one function that carries out the MCMC posterior
  sampling for Bayesian linear regression models where summary statistics are used
  as input. The function read.regress.data.ff utilizes the R package ''ff'' to handle
  data sets that are too large to fit into a user''s physical memory, by reading in
  data in chunks.'
