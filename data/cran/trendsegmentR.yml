title: Linear Trend Segmentation and Point Anomaly Detection
maintainer: Hyeyoung Maeng
description: |-
  Performs the detection of point anomalies and linear trend changes
  for univariate time series by implementing the bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation
  proposed by H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz (2019) <http://personal.lse.ac.uk/maengh/>.
  The estimated number and locations of the change-points are returned with the
  piecewise-linear estimator for signal.
