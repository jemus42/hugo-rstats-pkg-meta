title: Get the Timezone Information
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  A function to retrieve the system timezone on Unix systems
  which has been found to find an answer when 'Sys.timezone()' has failed.
  It is based on an answer by Duane McCully posted on 'StackOverflow', and
  adapted to be callable from R. The package also builds on Windows, but
  just returns NULL.
