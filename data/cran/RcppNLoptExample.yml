title: '''Rcpp'' Package Illustrating Header-Only Access to ''NLopt'''
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  An example package which shows use of 'NLopt' functionality from
  C++ via 'Rcpp' without requiring linking, and relying just on 'nloptr' thanks
  to the exporting API added there by Jelmer Ypma. This package is a fully
  functioning, updated, and expanded version of the initial example by
  Julien Chiquet at <https://github.com/jchiquet/RcppArmadilloNLoptExample>
  also containing a large earlier pull request of mine.
