title: Community Dynamics Metrics
maintainer: Matthew B. Jones
description: |-
  Univariate and multivariate temporal and spatial diversity indices,
  rank abundance curves, and community stability measures. The functions
  implement measures that are either explicitly temporal and include the
  option to calculate them over multiple replicates, or spatial and include
  the option to calculate them over multiple time points. Functions fall into
  five categories: static diversity indices, temporal diversity indices,
  spatial diversity indices, rank abundance curves, and community stability
  measures. The diversity indices are temporal and spatial analogs to
  traditional diversity indices. Specifically, the package includes functions
  to calculate community richness, evenness and diversity at a given point in
  space and time. In addition, it contains functions to calculate species
  turnover, mean rank shifts, and lags in community similarity between two
  time points.
