title: 'Chronomics Analysis Toolkit (CAT): Periodicity Analysis'
maintainer: Cathy Lee Gierke
description: Calculates auto- and cross-correlation functions and plots an actogram
  and a smoothing function from a time series to identify and visualize periodic components.
  Tests presence of anticipated rhythm and estimates rhythm parameters; fits model
  consisting of multiple rhythmic components to data; performs least squares spectral
  analysis and other cosinor-based analyses, including population-mean cosinor (PMC)
  and population-mean cosinor parameter tests (PMCtest).
