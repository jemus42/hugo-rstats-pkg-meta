title: Robust Backfitting
maintainer: Matias Salibian-Barrera
description: |-
  A robust backfitting algorithm for additive models based on (robust) local polynomial
  kernel smoothers. It includes both bounded and re-descending (kernel) M-estimators, and
  it computes predictions for points outside the training set if desired. See
  Boente, Martinez and Salibian-Barrera (2017) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2017.1369077> for
  details.
