  Meta-analysis for Classification Data and Correction to
  Imperfect Reference
maintainer: Huiling Huang
description: This package allows doing meta-analysis for primary studies with classification
  outcomes in order to evaluate systematically the accuracies of classifiers, namely,
  the diagnostic tests. It provides functions to fit the bivariate model of Reitsma
  et al.(2005). Moreover, if the reference employed in the classification process
  isn't a gold standard, its deficit can be detected and its influence to the underestimation
  of the diagnostic test's accuracy can be corrected, as described in Botella et al.(2013).
