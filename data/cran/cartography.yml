description: |-
  Create and integrate maps in your R workflow. This package helps
  to design cartographic representations such as proportional symbols,
  choropleth, typology, flows or discontinuities maps. It also offers several
  features that improve the graphic presentation of maps, for instance, map
  palettes, layout elements (scale, north arrow, title...), labels or legends.
