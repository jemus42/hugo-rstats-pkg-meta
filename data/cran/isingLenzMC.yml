title: Monte Carlo for Classical Ising Model
maintainer: Mehmet Suzen
description: Classical Ising Model is a land mark system in statistical physics.The
  model explains the physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, and cooperative
  phenomenon in general, for example phase transitions and neural networks.This package
  provides utilities to simulate one dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and Glauber
  Monte Carlo with single flip dynamics in periodic boundary conditions. Utility functions
  for exact solutions are provided.
