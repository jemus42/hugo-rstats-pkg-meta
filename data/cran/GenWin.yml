title: Spline Based Window Boundaries for Genomic Analyses
maintainer: Timothy M. Beissinger
description: |-
  Defines window or bin boundaries for the analysis of genomic data.
  Boundaries are based on the inflection points of a cubic smoothing spline
  fitted to the raw data. Along with defining boundaries, a technique to
  evaluate results obtained from unequally-sized windows is provided.
  Applications are particularly pertinent for, though not limited to, genome
  scans for selection based on variability between populations (e.g. using
  Wright's fixations index, Fst, which measures variability in subpopulations
  relative to the total population).
