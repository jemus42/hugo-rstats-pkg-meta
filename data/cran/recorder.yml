title: Toolkit to Validate New Data for a Predictive Model
maintainer: Lars Kjeldgaard
description: |-
  A lightweight toolkit to validate new observations when computing
  their predictions with a predictive model. The validation process
  consists of two steps: (1) record relevant statistics and meta data of the
  variables in the original training data for the predictive model and
  (2) use these data to run a set of basic validation tests on the new set of
  observations.
