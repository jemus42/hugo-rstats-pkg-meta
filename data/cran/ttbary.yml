title: Barycenter Methods for Spatial Point Patterns
maintainer: Dominic Schuhmacher
description: Computes a point pattern in R^2 or on a graph that is representative
  of a collection of many data patterns. The result is an approximate barycenter (also
  known as Fréchet mean or prototype) based on a transport-transform metric. Possible
  choices include Optimal SubPattern Assignment (OSPA) and Spike Time metrics. Details
  can be found in Müller, Schuhmacher and Mateu (2019) <arXiv:1909.07266>.
