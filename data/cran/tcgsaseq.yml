maintainer: Boris P. Hejblum
description: |-
  Analyze RNA-seq data with variance component score test accounting
  for data heteroscedasticity through precision weights. Perform both gene-wise and gene set
  analyses, and can deal with longitudinal data. Method is detailed in: Agniel D & Hejblum BP (2017)
  Variance component score test for time-course gene set analysis of longitudinal RNA-seq data,
  Biostatistics, 18(4):589-604.
