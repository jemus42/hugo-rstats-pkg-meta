maintainer: Dr. Nicola Zaccarelli
description: |-
  Functions to calculate several ecological indices of individual
  and population niche width (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity
  among individuals, IS, Petraitis' W, and Roughgarden's WIC/TNW) to assess
  individual specialization based on data of resource use. Resource use can
  be quantified by counts of categories, measures of mass or length, or
  proportions. Monte Carlo resampling procedures are available for hypothesis
  testing against multinomial null models.
