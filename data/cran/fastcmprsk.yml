title: Fine-Gray Regression via Forward-Backward Scan
maintainer: Eric S. Kawaguchi
description: In competing risks regression, the proportional subdistribution hazards
  (PSH) model is popular for its direct assessment of covariate effects on the cumulative
  incidence function. This package allows for both penalized and unpenalized PSH regression
  in linear time using a novel forward-backward scan. Penalties include Ridge, Lease
  Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation
  (SCAD), Minimax Concave Plus (MCP), and elastic net.
