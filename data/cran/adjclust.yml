  Adjacency-Constrained Clustering of a Block-Diagonal Similarity
  Matrix
maintainer: Pierre Neuvial
description: |-
  Implements a constrained version of hierarchical agglomerative
  clustering, in which each observation is associated to a position, and
  only adjacent clusters can be merged. Typical application fields in
  bioinformatics include Genome-Wide Association Studies or Hi-C data
  analysis, where the similarity between items is a decreasing function of
  their genomic distance. Taking advantage of this feature, the implemented
  algorithm is time and memory efficient. This algorithm is described in
  Chapter 4 of Alia Dehman (2015)
