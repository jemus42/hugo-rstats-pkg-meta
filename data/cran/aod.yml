title: Analysis of Overdispersed Data
maintainer: Renaud Lancelot
description: |-
  Provides a set of functions to analyse
  overdispersed counts or proportions. Most of the methods are
  already available elsewhere but are scattered in different
  packages. The proposed functions should be considered as
  complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
  estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect
  models (GLMM).
