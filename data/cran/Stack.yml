version: 2.0-1
title: Stylized concatenation of data.frames or ffdfs
maintainer: Mike Malecki
description: |-
  Stacks rectangular datasets on top of each other, possibly
  performing several type coercions along the way. For large datasets,
  depends on the ff package. Provides an aggressive version of
  ffbase::compact for data that may appear be real-typed but is in fact
  int/short/byte. For many purposes plyr::rbind.fill may be more appropriate,
  but for some kinds of survey data, the rules here work better.
