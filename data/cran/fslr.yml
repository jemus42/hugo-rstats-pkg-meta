  Functional MRI of the Brain ('FMRIB')

description: |-
  Wrapper functions that interface with 'FSL'
  <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>, a powerful and commonly-used 'neuroimaging'
  software, using system commands. The goal is to be able to interface with 'FSL'
  completely in R, where you pass R objects of class 'nifti', implemented by
  package 'oro.nifti', and the function executes an 'FSL' command and returns an R
  object of class 'nifti' if desired.
