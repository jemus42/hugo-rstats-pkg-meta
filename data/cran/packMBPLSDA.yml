title: Multi-Block Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis
maintainer: Marion Brandolini-Bunlon
description: 'Several functions are provided to implement a MBPLSDA : components search,
  optimal model components number search, optimal model validity test by permutation
  tests, observed values evaluation of optimal model parameters and predicted categories,
  bootstrap values evaluation of optimal model parameters and predicted cross-validated
  categories. The use of this package is described in Brandolini-Bunlon et al (2019,
  Multi-block PLS discriminant analysis for the joint analysis of metabolomic and
  epidemiological data (submitted in Metabolomics)).'
