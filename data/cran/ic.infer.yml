title: Inequality Constrained Inference in Linear Normal Situations
maintainer: Ulrike Groemping
description: Implements inequality constrained inference. This includes parameter
  estimation in normal (linear) models under linear equality and inequality constraints,
  as well as normal likelihood ratio tests involving inequality-constrained hypotheses.
  For inequality-constrained linear models, averaging over R-squared for different
  orderings of regressors is also included.
