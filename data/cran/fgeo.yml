  To help you access, transform, analyze, and
  visualize ForestGEO data, we developed a collection of R packages
  (<https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/>). This package, in particular,
  helps you to install and load the entire package-collection with a
  single R command, and provides convenient ways to find relevant
  documentation. Most commonly, you should not worry about the
  individual packages that make up the package-collection as you can
  access all features via this package. To learn more about ForestGEO
  visit <http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/>.
