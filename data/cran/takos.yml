description: It includes functions for applying methodologies utilized for single-process
  kinetic analysis of solid-state processes were recently summarized and described
  in the Recommendation of ICTAC Kinetic Committee. These methods work with the basic
  kinetic equation. The Methodologies included refers to  Avrami, Friedman, Kissinger,
  Ozawa, OFM, Mo, Starink, isoconversional methodology (Vyazovkin) according to ICATAC
  Kinetics Committee recommendations as reported in Vyazovkin S, Chrissafis K, Di
  Lorenzo ML, et al. ICTAC Kinetics Committee recommendations for collecting experimental
  thermal analysis data for kinetic computations. Thermochim Acta. 2014;590:1-23.
