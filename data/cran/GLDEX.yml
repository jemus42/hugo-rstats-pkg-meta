  Fitting Single and Mixture of Generalised Lambda Distributions
  (RS and FMKL) using Various Methods
maintainer: Steve Su
description: The fitting algorithms considered in this package have two major objectives.
  One is to provide a smoothing device to fit distributions to data using the weight
  and unweighted discretised approach based on the bin width of the histogram. The
  other is to provide a definitive fit to the data set using the maximum likelihood
  and quantile matching estimation. Other methods such as moment matching, starship
  method, L moment matching are also provided. Diagnostics on goodness of fit can
  be done via qqplots, KS-resample tests and comparing mean, variance, skewness and
  kurtosis of the data with the fitted distribution.
