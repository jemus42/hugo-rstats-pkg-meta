description: L1 regularized regression (Lasso) solver using the Cyclic<U+000a>Coordinate
  Descent algorithm aka Lasso Shooting is fast. This<U+000a>implementation can choose
  which coefficients to penalize. It<U+000a>support coefficient-specific penalities
  and it can take X'X and<U+000a>X'y instead of X and y.
