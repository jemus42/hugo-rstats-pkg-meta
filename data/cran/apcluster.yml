title: Affinity Propagation Clustering
maintainer: Ulrich Bodenhofer
description: |-
  Implements Affinity Propagation clustering introduced by Frey and
  Dueck (2007) <DOI:10.1126/science.1136800>. The algorithms are largely
  analogous to the 'Matlab' code published by Frey and Dueck.
  The package further provides leveraged affinity propagation and an
  algorithm for exemplar-based agglomerative clustering that can also be
  used to join clusters obtained from affinity propagation. Various
  plotting functions are available for analyzing clustering results.
