title: Organising and Analysing Eye-Tracking Data
maintainer: Hayward Godwin
description: |-
  A set of functions for organising and analysing datasets from
  experiments run using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help
  to clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark up
  key events such as display changes and responses made by participants.
  Analysing functions help to create means for a wide range of standard
  measures (such as 'mean fixation durations'), which can then be fed into
  the appropriate statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.
