title: Heatmaps for Multiple Network Data
maintainer: Philippe Boileau
description: |-
  Simplify the exploratory data analysis process for multiple network
  data sets with the help of hierarchical clustering, consensus
  clustering and heatmaps. Multiple network data consists of multiple
  disjoint networks that have common variables (e.g. ego networks).
  This package contains the necessary tools for exploring such data,
  from the data pre-processing stage to the creation of dynamic
  visualizations.
