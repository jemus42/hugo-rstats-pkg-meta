title: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
maintainer: Victhor Sart√≥rio
description: |-
  Implements simple Hamiltonian Monte Carlo routines in R for
  sampling from any desired target distribution which is continuous
  and smooth. See Neal (2017) <arXiv:1701.02434> for further details
  on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Automatic parameter selection is not
  supported.
