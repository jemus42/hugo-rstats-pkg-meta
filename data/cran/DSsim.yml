title: Distance Sampling Simulations
maintainer: Laura Marshall
description: |-
  Performs distance sampling simulations.It repeatedly generates
  instances of a user defined population within a given survey region, generates
  realisations of a survey design (currently these must be generated using
  Distance software in advance <http://distancesampling.org/>) and simulates
  the detection process. The data are then analysed so that the results can
  be compared for accuracy and precision across all replications. This will
  allow users to select survey designs which will give them the best accuracy
  and precision given their expectations about population distribution. Any
  uncertainty in population distribution or population parameters can be
  included by running the different survey designs for a number of different
  population descriptions. An example simulation can be found in the help file for
  make.simulation.
