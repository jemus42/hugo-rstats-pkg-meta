title: Rename and Encode Data Frames Using External Crosswalk Files
maintainer: Benjamin Skinner
description: |-
  A pair of functions for renaming and encoding data frames
  using external crosswalk files. It is especially useful when
  constructing master data sets from multiple smaller data
  sets that do not name or encode variables consistently
  across files. Based on similar commands in 'Stata'.
