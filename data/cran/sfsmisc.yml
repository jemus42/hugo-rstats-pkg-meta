description: |-
  Useful utilities ['goodies'] from Seminar fuer Statistik ETH Zurich,
  some of which were ported from S-plus in the 1990's.
  For graphics, have pretty (Log-scale) axes, an enhanced Tukey-Anscombe
  plot, combining histogram and boxplot, 2d-residual plots, a 'tachoPlot()',
  pretty arrows, etc.
  For robustness, have a robust F test and robust range().
  For system support, notably on Linux, provides 'Sys.*()' functions with
  more access to system and CPU information.
  Finally, miscellaneous utilities such as simple efficient prime numbers,
  integer codes, Duplicated(), toLatex.numeric() and is.whole().
