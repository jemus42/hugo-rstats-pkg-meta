description: 'Identification of ring borders on scanned image sections from dendrochronological
  samples. Processing of image reflectances to produce gray matrices and time series
  of smoothed gray values. Luminance data is plotted on segmented images for users
  to perform both: visual identification of ring borders or control of automatic detection.
  Routines to visually include/exclude ring borders on the R graphical devices, or
  automatically detect ring borders using a linear detection algorithm. This algorithm
  detects ring borders according to positive/negative extreme values in the smoothed
  time-series of gray values. Most of the in-package routines can be recursively implemented
  using the multiDetect() function.'
