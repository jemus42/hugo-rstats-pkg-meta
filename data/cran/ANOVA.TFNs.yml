title: One-Way Analysis of Variance Based on Triangular Fuzzy Numbers
maintainer: Abbas Parchami
description: Long formulas and complex computations are two disadvantage of the extended
  ANOVA approach where the observed data are fuzzy rather that crisp; for more details
  see Parchami et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/s40747-017-0046-8>. Package 'ANOVA.TFNs'
  can help to the applied users to overcome these two challenges. The most important
  functions in package 'ANOVA.TFNs' is FANOVA() which easily draw all membership functions
  of fuzzy numbers, report observed statistics in fuzzy ANOVA table, calculate the
  p-value and final result for Fuzzy ANOVA test at the certain significance level.
