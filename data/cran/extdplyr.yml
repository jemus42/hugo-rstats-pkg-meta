title: Data Manipulation Extensions of 'Dplyr' and 'Tidyr'
maintainer: Yuchen Wang
description: |-
  If 'dplyr' is a grammar for data manipulation, 'extdplyr' is like
  a short paragraph written in 'dplyr'. 'extdplyr' extends 'dplyr' and
  'tidyr' verbs to some common "routines" that manipulate data sets. It uses
  the same interface and preserves all the features from 'dplyr', has good
  performance, and supports various data sources.
