  An R Package for Multiple Break-Point Detection via the
  Cross-Entropy Method
maintainer: Priyadarshana W.J.R.M.
description: Implements the Cross-Entropy (CE) method, which is a model based stochastic
  optimization technique to estimate both the number and their corresponding locations
  of break-points in continuous and discrete measurements (Priyadarshana and Sofronov
  (2015), Priyadarshana and Sofronov (2012a), Priyadarshana and Sofronov (2012b)).
