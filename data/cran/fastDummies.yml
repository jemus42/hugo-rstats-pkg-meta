  Fast Creation of Dummy (Binary) Columns and Rows from
  Categorical Variables
maintainer: Jacob Kaplan
description: Creates dummy columns from columns that have categorical variables (character
  or factor types). You can also specify which columns to make dummies out of, or
  which columns to ignore. Also creates dummy rows from character, factor, and Date
  columns. This package provides a significant speed increase from creating dummy
  variables through model.matrix().
