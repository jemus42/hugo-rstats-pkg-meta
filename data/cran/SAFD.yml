version: '2.1'
title: Statistical Analysis of Fuzzy Data
maintainer: Asun Lubiano
description: |-
  The aim of the package is to provide some basic functions
  for doing statistics with one dimensional Fuzzy Data (in the
  form of polygonal fuzzy numbers). In particular, the package
  contains functions for the basic operations on the class of
  fuzzy numbers (sum, scalar product, mean, median, Hukuhara difference)
  as well as for calculating (Bertoluzza) distance and sample variance.
  Moreover a function to simulate fuzzy random variables and bootstrap tests
  for the equality of means is included. Version 2.1 fixes some bugs
  of previous versions.
