version: 2.16.1
title: Unified Handling of Graphics Devices
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: |-
  Functions for creating plots and image files in a unified way
  regardless of output format (EPS, PDF, PNG, SVG, TIFF, WMF, etc.). Default
  device options as well as scales and aspect ratios are controlled in a uniform
  way across all device types. Switching output format requires minimal changes
  in code. This package is ideal for large-scale batch processing, because it
  will never leave open graphics devices or incomplete image files behind, even on
  errors or user interrupts.
