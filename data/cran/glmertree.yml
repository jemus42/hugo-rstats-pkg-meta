title: Generalized Linear Mixed Model Trees
maintainer: Marjolein Fokkema
description: |-
  Recursive partitioning based on (generalized) linear mixed models
  (GLMMs) combining lmer()/glmer() from 'lme4' and lmtree()/glmtree() from
  'partykit'. The fitting algorithm is described in more detail in Fokkema,
  Smits, Zeileis, Hothorn & Kelderman (2018; <DOI:10.3758/s13428-017-0971-x>).
