title: Implementation of the Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model
maintainer: Paul Julian
description: Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model predicts variations in water-column
  P concentration, peat accretion rate, and soil P concentration along a horizontal
  gradient imposed by an external phosphorus load and sheet-flow conditions. Potential
  biological responses are expressed in terms of marsh surface area exceeding threshold
  criteria for water-column and soil phosphorus concentrations. More information of
  the model can be found at <http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/>.
