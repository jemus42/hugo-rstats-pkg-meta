  Fast, Exact Bootstrap Principal Component Analysis for High
  Dimensional Data
maintainer: Aaron Fisher
description: |-
  Implements fast, exact bootstrap Principal Component Analysis and
  Singular Value Decompositions for high dimensional data, as described in
  <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0922>. For data matrices that are too large to operate
  on in memory, users can input objects with class 'ff' (see the 'ff'
  package), where the actual data is stored on disk. In response, this
  package will implement a block matrix algebra procedure for calculating the
  principal components (PCs) and bootstrap PCs. Depending on options set by
  the user, the 'parallel' package can be used to parallelize the calculation of
  the bootstrap PCs.
