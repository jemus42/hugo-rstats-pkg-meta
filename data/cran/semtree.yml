description: |-
  SEM Trees and SEM Forests -- an extension of model-based decision
  trees and forests to Structural Equation Models (SEM). SEM trees hierarchically
  split empirical data into homogeneous groups sharing similar data patterns
  with respect to a SEM by recursively selecting optimal predictors of these
  differences. SEM forests are an extension of SEM trees. They are ensembles of
  SEM trees each built on a random sample of the original data. By aggregating
  over a forest, we obtain measures of variable importance that are more robust
  than measures from single trees.
