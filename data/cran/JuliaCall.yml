title: Seamless Integration Between R and 'Julia'
maintainer: Changcheng Li
description: |-
  Provides an R interface to 'Julia',
  which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
  for numerical computing, see <https://julialang.org/> for more information.
  It provides a high-level interface as well as a low-level interface.
  Using the high level interface, you could call any 'Julia' function just like
  any R function with automatic type conversion. Using the low level interface,
  you could deal with C-level SEXP directly while enjoying the convenience of
  using a high-level programming language like 'Julia'.
