title: Incremental Calculation of Dynamic Time Warping
maintainer: Maximilian Leodolter
description: The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure for time series allows
  non-linear alignments of time series to match  similar patterns in time series of
  different lengths and or different speeds. IncDTW is characterized by (1) the incremental
  calculation of DTW (reduces runtime complexity to a linear level for updating the
  DTW distance) - especially for life data streams or subsequence matching, (2) the
  vector based implementation of DTW which is faster because no matrices are allocated
  (reduces the space complexity from a quadratic to a linear level in the number of
  observations) - for all runtime intensive DTW computations, (3) the subsequence
  matching algorithm runDTW, that efficiently finds the k-NN to a query pattern in
  a long time series, and (4) C++ in the heart. For details about DTW see the original
  paper "Dynamic programming algorithm optimization for spoken word recognition" by
  Sakoe and Chiba (1978) <DOI:10.1109/TASSP.1978.1163055>.
