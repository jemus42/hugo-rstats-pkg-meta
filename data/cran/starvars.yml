  Vector Logistic Smooth Transition Models / Realized Covariances
  Construction
maintainer: Andrea Bucci
description: Allows the user to estimate a vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive
  model via maximum log-likelihood or nonlinear least squares. It further permits
  to test for linearity in the multivariate framework against a vector logistic smooth
  transition autoregressive model with a single transition variable. The estimation
  method is discussed in Terasvirta and Yang (2014, <doi:10.1108/S0731-9053(2013)0000031008>).
  Also, realized covariances can be constructed from stock market prices or returns,
  as explained in Andersen et al. (2001, <doi:10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00055-1>).
