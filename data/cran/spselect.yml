title: Selecting Spatial Scale of Covariates in Regression Models
maintainer: Lauren Grant
description: Fits spatial scale (SS) forward stepwise regression, SS incremental forward
  stagewise regression, SS least angle regression (LARS), and SS lasso models.  All
  area-level covariates are considered at all available scales to enter a model, but
  the SS algorithms are constrained to select each area-level covariate at a single
  spatial scale.
