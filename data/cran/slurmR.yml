maintainer: George Vega Yon
description: |-
  'Slurm', Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
  <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>, is a popular 'Linux' based software used to
  schedule jobs in 'HPC' (High Performance Computing) clusters. This R package
  provides a specialized lightweight wrapper of 'Slurm' with a syntax similar to
  that found in the 'parallel' R package. The package also includes a method for
  creating socket cluster objects spanning multiple nodes that can be used with
  the 'parallel' package.
