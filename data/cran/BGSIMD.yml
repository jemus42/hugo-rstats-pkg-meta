title: Block Gibbs Sampler with Incomplete Multinomial Distribution
maintainer: Kwang Woo Ahn
description: Implement an efficient block Gibbs sampler with incomplete<U+000a>data
  from a multinomial distribution taking values from the k<U+000a>categories 1,2,...,k,
  where data are assumed to miss at random<U+000a>and each missing datum belongs to
  one and only one of m<U+000a>distinct non-empty proper subsets A1, A2,..., Am of
  1,2,...,k<U+000a>and the k categories are labelled such that only consecutive<U+000a>A's
  may overlap.
