  Data

description: |-
  Perform the Adaptable Regularized Hotelling's T^2 test (ARHT) proposed by
  Li et al., (2016) <arXiv:1609.08725>. Both one-sample and two-sample mean test are available with
  various probabilistic alternative prior models. It contains a function to consistently
  estimate higher order moments of the population covariance spectral distribution using
  the spectral of the sample covariance matrix (Bai et al. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-842X.2010.00590.x>).
  In addition, it contains a function to sample from 3-variate chi-squared random vectors approximately
  with a given correlation matrix when the degrees of freedom are large.
