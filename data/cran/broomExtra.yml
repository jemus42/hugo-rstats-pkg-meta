version: 4.0.2
title: Enhancements for 'broom' and 'easystats' Package Families
maintainer: Indrajeet Patil
description: |-
  Provides helper functions that assist in data
  analysis workflows involving regression analyses. The goal is to
  combine the functionality offered by different set of packages
  ('broom', 'broom.mixed', 'parameters', and 'performance') through a
  common syntax to return tidy dataframes containing model parameters
  and performance measure summaries. The 'grouped_' variants of the
  generics provides a convenient way to execute functions across a
  combination of grouping variable(s) in a dataframe.
