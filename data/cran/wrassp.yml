title: Interface to the 'ASSP' Library
maintainer: Raphael Winkelmann
description: |-
  A wrapper around Michel Scheffers's 'libassp' (<http://libassp.sourceforge.net/>).
  The 'libassp' (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at providing
  functionality for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats
  and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This
  includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean
  square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing
  rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of
  'libassp's signal processing functions and provides them to the user in a
  (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
