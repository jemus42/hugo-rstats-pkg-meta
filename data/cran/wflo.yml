  Data Set and Helper Functions for Wind Farm Layout Optimization
  Problems
maintainer: Carsten Croonenbroeck
description: |-
  Provides a convenient data set, a set of helper functions, and a benchmark function for
  economically (profit) driven wind farm layout optimization. This enables researchers in the field of the NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problem of wind farm layout optimization to focus on their optimization methodology contribution and also provides a realistic benchmark setting for comparability among contributions.
