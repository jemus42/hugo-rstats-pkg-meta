title: Analysis of Diversity
maintainer: Sandrine Pavoine
description: Functions, data sets and examples for the calculation of various indices
  of biodiversity including species, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Part of
  the indices are expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species. The package
  also provides ways to partition biodiversity across spatial or temporal scales (alpha,
  beta, gamma diversities). In addition to the quantification of biodiversity, ordination
  approaches are available which rely on diversity indices and allow the detailed
  identification of species, functional or phylogenetic differences between communities.
