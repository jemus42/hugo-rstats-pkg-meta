title: Centre of Mass Assessment and Consolidation of Trees
maintainer: Marco Bascietto
description: |-
  The centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in order to
  consolidate a tree using steel or dynamic cables. Given field-recorded data
  on branchiness of a tree, the package: (i) computes and plots the centre of
  mass of the tree itself, (ii) computes branches slenderness coefficient in
  order to aid the arborist identify potentially dangerous branches, and
  (iii) computes the force acting on a ground plinth and its best position
  relating to the tree centre of mass, should the tree need to be stabilized
  by a steel cable.
