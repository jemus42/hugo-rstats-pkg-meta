  Compute the Coefficient of Determination for Vector or Matrix
  Outcomes
maintainer: Tommy Jones
description: |-
  Compute the coefficient of determination for outcomes in n-dimensions.
  May be useful for multidimensional predictions (such as a multinomial model) or
  calculating goodness of fit from latent variable models such as probabilistic
  topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation or deterministic topic models
  like latent semantic analysis. Based on Jones (2019) <arXiv:1911.11061>.
