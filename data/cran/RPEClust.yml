title: Random Projection Ensemble Clustering Algorithm
maintainer: Francesca Fortunato
description: Implements the methodology proposed by Anderlucci, Fortunato and Montanari
  (2019) <arXiv:1909.10832> for high-dimensional unsupervised classification. The
  random projection ensemble clustering algorithm applies a Gaussian Mixture Model
  to different random projections of the high-dimensional data and selects a subset
  of solutions accordingly to the Bayesian Information Criterion, computed here as
  discussed in Raftery and Dean (2006) <doi:10.1198/016214506000000113>. The clustering
  results obtained on the selected projections are then aggregated via consensus to
  derive the final partition.
