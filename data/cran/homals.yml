title: Gifi Methods for Optimal Scaling
maintainer: Patrick Mair
description: Performs a homogeneity analysis (multiple correspondence analysis) and
  various extensions. Rank restrictions on the category quantifications can be imposed
  (nonlinear PCA). The categories are transformed by means of optimal scaling with
  options for nominal, ordinal, and numerical scale levels (for rank-1 restrictions).
  Variables can be grouped into sets, in order to emulate regression analysis and
  canonical correlation analysis.
