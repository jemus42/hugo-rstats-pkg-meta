title: Fit GLM's with High-Dimensional k-Way Fixed Effects
maintainer: Amrei Stammann
description: |-
  Provides a routine to concentrate out factors with many levels during the
  optimization of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm).
  The package is based on the algorithm proposed by Stammann (2018) <arXiv:1707.01815> and is
  restricted to glm's that are based on maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear. It also offers
  an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a post-estimation routine and
  includes robust and multi-way clustered standard errors. Further the package provides analytical
  bias corrections for binary choice models (logit and probit) derived by Fernandez-Val
  and Weidner (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.12.014> and Hinz, Stammann, and Wanner (2019).
