title: Regularized Multi-Task Learning
maintainer: Han Cao
description: Efficient solvers for 10 regularized multi-task learning algorithms applicable
  for regression, classification, joint feature selection, task clustering, low-rank
  learning, sparse learning and network incorporation. Based on the accelerated gradient
  descent method, the algorithms feature a state-of-art computational complexity O(1/k^2).
  Sparse model structure is induced by the solving the proximal operator. The detail
  of the package is described in the paper of Han Cao and Emanuel Schwarz (2018) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty831>.
