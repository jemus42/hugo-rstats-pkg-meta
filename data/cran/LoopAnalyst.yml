title: A Collection of Tools to Conduct Levins' Loop Analysis
maintainer: Alexis Dinno
description: Loop analysis makes qualitative predictions of variable change in a system
  of causally interdependent variables, where "qualitative" means sign only (i.e.
  increases, decreases, non change, and ambiguous). This implementation includes output
  support for graphs in .dot file format for use with visualization software such
  as 'graphviz' (<http://graphviz.org>). 'LoopAnalyst' provides tools for the construction
  and output of community matrices, computation and output of community effect matrices,
  tables of correlations, adjoint, absolute feedback, weighted feedback and weighted
  prediction matrices, change in life expectancy matrices, and feedback, path and
  loop enumeration tools.
