  Phylogenetically Classifies Retention Mechanisms of Duplicate
  Genes from Gene Expression Data
maintainer: Raquel Assis
description: |-
  Classification is based on the recently developed phylogenetic
  approach by Assis and Bachtrog (2013). The method classifies the
  evolutionary mechanisms retaining pairs of duplicate genes (conservation,
  neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or specialization) by comparing gene
  expression profiles of duplicate genes in one species to those of their single-
  copy ancestral genes in a sister species.
