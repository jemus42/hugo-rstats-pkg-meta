title: LncRNA Identification and Analysis Using Heterologous Features
maintainer: Siyu HAN
description: 'Long non-coding RNAs identification and analysis. Default models are
  trained with human, mouse and wheat datasets by employing SVM. Features are based
  on intrinsic composition of sequence, EIIP value (electron-ion interaction pseudopotential),
  and secondary structure. This package can also extract other classic features and
  build new classifiers. Reference: Han SY., Liang YC., Li Y., et al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/bib/bby065>.'
