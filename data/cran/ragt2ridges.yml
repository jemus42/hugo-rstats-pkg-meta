title: Ridge Estimation of Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) Processes
maintainer: Wessel N. van Wieringen
description: 'The ragt2ridges-package provides ridge maximum likelihood estimation
  of vector auto-regressive processes: the VAR(1), VAR(2) and VARX(1) model (more
  to be added). Prior knowledge may be incorporated in the estimation through a) specification
  of the edges believed to be absent in the time series chain graph, and b) a shrinkage
  target towards which the parameter estimate is shrunken for large penalty parameter
  values. Estimation functionality is accompanied by methodology for penalty parameter
  selection. In addition, the package offers supporting functionality for the exploitation
  of estimated models. Among others, i) a procedure to infer the support of the non-sparse
  ridge estimate (and thereby of the time series chain graph) is implemented, ii)
  a table of node-wise network summary statistics, iii) mutual information analysis,
  and iv) impulse response analysis. Cf. Miok et al. (2017) <DOI:10.1002/bimj.201500269>
  and Miok et al. (2019) <DOI:10.1002/bimj.201700195> for details on the implemented
  methods.'
