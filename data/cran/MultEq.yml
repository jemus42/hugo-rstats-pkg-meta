title: Multiple Equivalence Tests and Simultaneous Confidence Intervals
maintainer: Mario Hasler
description: |-
  Equivalence tests and related confidence intervals for the
  comparison of two treatments, simultaneously for one or many
  normally distributed, primary response variables (endpoints).
  The step-up procedure of Quan et al. (2001) is both applied for
  differences and extended to ratios of means. A related
  single-step procedure is also available.
