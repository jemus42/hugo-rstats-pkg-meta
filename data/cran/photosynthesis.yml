description: Simulate C3 photosynthesis using the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry (1980)
  <doi:10.1007/BF00386231> model as described in Buckley and Diaz-Espejo (2015) <doi:10.1111/pce.12459>.
  It uses units to ensure that parameters are properly specified and transformed before
  calculations. Temperature response functions get automatically "baked" into all
  parameters based on leaf temperature following Bernacchi et al. (2002) <doi:10.1104/pp.008250>.
  The package includes boundary layer, cuticular, stomatal, and mesophyll conductances
  to CO2, which each can vary on the upper and lower portions of the leaf. Use straightforward
  functions to simulate photosynthesis over environmental gradients such as Photosynthetic
  Photon Flux Density (PPFD) and leaf temperature, or over trait gradients such as
  CO2 conductance or photochemistry.
