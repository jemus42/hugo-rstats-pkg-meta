title: Logistic Regression Trees
maintainer: Adrien Ehrhardt
description: A logistic regression tree is a decision tree with logistic regressions
  at its leaves. A particular stochastic expectation maximization algorithm is used
  to draw a few good trees, that are then assessed via the user's criterion of choice
  among BIC / AIC / test set Gini. The formal development is given in a PhD chapter,
  see Ehrhardt (2019) <https://github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these/releases/>.
