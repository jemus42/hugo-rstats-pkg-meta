title: The Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm
maintainer: Lampros Mouselimis
description: 'Training and predict functions for Single Hidden-layer Feedforward Neural
  Networks (SLFN) using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. The ELM algorithm
  differs from the traditional gradient-based algorithms for very short training times
  (it doesn''t need any iterative tuning, this makes learning time very fast) and
  there is no need to set any other parameters like learning rate, momentum, epochs,
  etc. This is a reimplementation of the ''elmNN'' package using ''RcppArmadillo''
  after the ''elmNN'' package was archived. For more information, see "Extreme learning
  machine: Theory and applications" by Guang-Bin Huang, Qin-Yu Zhu, Chee-Kheong Siew
  (2006), Elsevier B.V, <doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126>.'
