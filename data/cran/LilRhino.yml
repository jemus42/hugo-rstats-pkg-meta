  For Implementation of Feed Reduction, Learning Examples, NLP and
  Code Management
maintainer: Travis Barton
description: This is for code management functions, NLP tools, a Monty Hall simulator,
  and for implementing my own variable reduction technique called Feed Reduction <http://wbbpredictions.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Redditbot_Paper.pdf>.
  The Feed Reduction technique is not yet published, but is merely a tool for implementing
  a series of binary neural networks meant for reducing data into N dimensions, where
  N is the number of possible values of the response variable.
