description: |2-

  High-order functions for data manipulation : sort or group data, given one
  or more auxiliary functions. Functions are inspired by other pure
  functional programming languages ('Haskell' mainly). The package also
  provides built-in function operators for creating compact anonymous
  functions, as well as the possibility to use the 'purrr' package syntax.
