title: Heatmap-Related Plots and Smooth Multiband Color Interpolation
maintainer: Abby Spurdle
description: Supports combined contour-heat plots and 3D bar/surface plots, for plotting
  scalar fields, either discretely-spaced or continuously-spaced. Also, supports matrix
  visualization (per se), isosurfaces (for scalar fields over three variables), triangular
  plots and vector fields. All plots use static vector graphics (suitable for Sweave
  documents), but high resolution heatmaps can produce smooth raster-like visual effects.
  Contains a flexible system for smooth multiband color interpolation in RGB, HSV
  and HCL color spaces.
