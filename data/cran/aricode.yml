  Efficient Computations of Standard Clustering Comparison
  Measures
maintainer: Julien Chiquet
description: |-
  Implements an efficient O(n) algorithm based on bucket-sorting for
  fast computation of standard clustering comparison measures. Available measures
  include adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized information distance (NID),
  normalized mutual information (NMI), adjusted mutual information (AMI),
  normalized variation information (NVI) and entropy, as described in Vinh et al (2009)
