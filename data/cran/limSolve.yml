title: Solving Linear Inverse Models
maintainer: Karline Soetaert
description: |-
  Functions that (1) find the minimum/maximum of a linear or quadratic function:
  min or max (f(x)), where f(x) = ||Ax-b||^2 or f(x) = sum(a_i*x_i)
  subject to equality constraints Ex=f and/or inequality constraints Gx>=h,
  (2) sample an underdetermined- or overdetermined system Ex=f subject to Gx>=h, and if applicable Ax~=b,
  (3) solve a linear system Ax=B for the unknown x. It includes banded and tridiagonal linear systems.
