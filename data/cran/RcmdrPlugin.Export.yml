title: Export R Output to LaTeX or HTML
maintainer: Liviu Andronic
description: |-
  Export Rcmdr output to LaTeX or HTML code. The
  plug-in was originally intended to facilitate exporting Rcmdr
  output to formats other than ASCII text and to provide R
  novices with an easy-to-use, easy-to-access reference on
  exporting R objects to formats suited for printed output. The
  package documentation contains several pointers on creating
  reports, either by using conventional word processors or
  LaTeX/LyX.
