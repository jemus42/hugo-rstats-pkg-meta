title: Cross-Entropy Optimisation of Noisy Functions
maintainer: Flavio Santi
description: |-
  Cross-Entropy optimisation of unconstrained deterministic and noisy
  functions illustrated in Rubinstein and Kroese (2004, ISBN:
  978-1-4419-1940-3) through a highly flexible and customisable function which
  allows user to define custom variable domains, sampling distributions,
  updating and smoothing rules, and stopping criteria. Several built-in
  methods and settings make the package very easy-to-use under standard
  optimisation problems.
