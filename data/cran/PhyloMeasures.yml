description: |-
  Given a phylogenetic tree T and an assemblage S of species represented as
  a subset of tips in T, we want to compute a measure of the diversity
  of the species in S with respect to T. The current package offers
  efficient algorithms that can process large phylogenetic data for several such measures.
  Most importantly, the package includes algorithms for computing
  efficiently the standardized versions of phylogenetic measures and their p-values, which are
  essential for null model comparisons. Among other functions,
  the package provides efficient computation of richness-standardized versions
  for indices such as the net relatedness index (NRI),
  nearest taxon index (NTI), phylogenetic
  diversity index (PDI), and the corresponding indices of two-sample measures.
  The package also introduces a new
  single-sample measure, the Core Ancestor Cost (CAC); the package provides
  functions for computing the value and the standardised index of the CAC and,
  more than that, there is an extra function available that can compute exactly
  any statistical moment of the measure. The package supports computations
  under different null models, including abundance-weighted models.
