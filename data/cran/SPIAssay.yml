title: A Genetic-Based Assay for the Identification of Cell Lines
maintainer: Davide Prandi
description: 'The SNP Panel Identification Assay (SPIA) is a package that enables
  an accurate determination of cell line identity from the genotype of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs). The SPIA test allows to discern when two cell lines are close
  enough to be called similar and when they are not. Details about the method are
  available at "Demichelis et al. (2008) SNP panel identification assay (SPIA): a
  genetic-based assay for the identification of cell lines. Nucleic Acids Res., 3,
  2446-2456".'
