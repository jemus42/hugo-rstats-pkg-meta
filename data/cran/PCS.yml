title: Calculate the probability of correct selection (PCS)
maintainer: Jason Wilson
description: Given k populations (can be in thousands), what is the probability that
  a given subset of size t contains the true top t populations?  This package finds
  this probability and offers three tuning parameters (G, d, L) to relax the definition.
