title: Over Sampling for Time Series Classification
maintainer: Lan Wei
description: |-
  Oversampling of imbalanced univariate time series classification data
  using integrated ESPO and ADASYN methods. Enhanced Structure Preserving Oversampling
  (ESPO) is used to generate a large percentage of the synthetic minority samples
  from univariate labeled time series under the modeling assumption that the predictors
  are Gaussian. ESPO estimates the covariance structure of the minority-class samples
  and applies a spectral filer to reduce noise. Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling
  approach is a nearest neighbor interpolation approach which is subsequently applied
  to the ESPO samples. This code is ported from a 'MATLAB' implementation by Cao et al.
  <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2013.37> and adapted for use with Recurrent Neural Networks
  implemented in 'TensorFlow'.
