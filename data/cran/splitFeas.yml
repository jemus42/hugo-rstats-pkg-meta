title: Multi-Set Split Feasibility
maintainer: Eric C. Chi
description: |-
  An implementation of the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm introduced by
  Xu, Chi, Yang, and Lange (2017) <arXiv:1612.05614> for solving multi-set split feasibility problems. In the multi-set split feasibility problem, we seek to find a point x
  in the intersection of multiple closed sets and whose image under a mapping also must fall in the intersection of several closed sets.
