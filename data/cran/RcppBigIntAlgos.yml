title: Factor Big Integers with the Quadratic Sieve
maintainer: Joseph Wood
description: |-
  Features the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (MPQS) algorithm
  for factoring large integers and a vectorized factoring function that
  returns the complete factorization of an integer. The MPQS is based off of
  the seminal work of Carl Pomerance (1984) <doi:10.1007/3-540-39757-4_17>
  along with the modification of multiple polynomials introduced by Peter
  Montgomery and J. Davis as outlined by Robert D. Silverman (1987)
  <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1987-0866119-8>. Utilizes the C library
  GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic). The Pollard's rho algorithm for
  factoring smaller numbers is the same algorithm used by the factorize
  function in the 'gmp' package.
