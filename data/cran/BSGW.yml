  Bayesian Survival Model with Lasso Shrinkage Using Generalized
  Weibull Regression
maintainer: Alireza S. Mahani
description: Bayesian survival model using Weibull regression on both scale and shape
  parameters. Dependence of shape parameter on covariates permits deviation from proportional-hazard
  assumption, leading to dynamic - i.e. non-constant with time - hazard ratios between
  subjects. Bayesian Lasso shrinkage in the form of two Laplace priors - one for scale
  and one for shape coefficients - allows for many covariates to be included. Cross-validation
  helper functions can be used to tune the shrinkage parameters. Monte Carlo Markov
  Chain (MCMC) sampling using a Gibbs wrapper around Radford Neal's univariate slice
  sampler (R package MfUSampler) is used for coefficient estimation.
