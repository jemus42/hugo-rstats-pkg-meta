description: Conduct multi-locus genome-wide association study under the framework
  of multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each marker
  on the genome is scanned. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent
  selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially
  associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects
  are estimated by empirical Bayes and all the nonzero effects were further identified
  by likelihood ratio test for true QTL. Wen YJ, Zhang H, Ni YL, Huang B, Zhang J,
