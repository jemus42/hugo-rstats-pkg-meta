description: |-
  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is widely used in Life Science
  research. The package (<http://www.kleinomicslab.com/software>) converts 1D or 2D data into a matrix of values
  suitable for further data analysis and performs basic processing steps in a
  reproducible way. Negative values, a common issue in such data, are replaced
  by positive values. All used parameters are stored in a readable text file
  and can be restored from that file to enable exact reproduction of the data
  at a later time.
