  Efficient Estimation of Discrete-Time Multivariate Frailty Model
  Using Exact Likelihood Function for Grouped Survival Data
maintainer: Jiaxing Lin
description: 'The core of this ''Rcpp'' based package is several functions to estimate
  the baseline hazard, frailty variance, and fixed effect parameter for a discrete-time
  shared frailty model with random effects. The functions are designed to analyze
  grouped time-to-event data accounting for family structure of related individuals
  (i.e., trios). The core functions include two processes: (1) evaluate the multivariable
  integration to compute the exact proportional hazards model based likelihood and
  (2) estimate the desired parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The integration
  is evaluated by the ''Cuhre'' algorithm from the ''Cuba'' library (Hahn, T., Cuba-a
  library for multidimensional numerical integration, Comput. Phys. Commun. 168, 2005,
  78-95 <doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.010>), and the source files of the ''Cuhre'' function
  are included in this package. The maximization process is carried out using Brent''s
  algorithm, with the ''C++'' code file from John Burkardt and John Denker (Brent,
  R.,Algorithms for Minimization without Derivatives, Dover, 2002, ISBN 0-486-41998-3).'
