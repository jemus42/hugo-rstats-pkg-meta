description: |-
  General tools for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to the data describing
  participants' problem solving processes in computer-based assessments. It is often recorded in computer
  log files. This package provides two action sequence generators and implements two automatic feature extraction methods that compress the information
  stored in process data, which often has a nonstandard format, into standard numerical vectors. This package
  also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate response processes with other binary or
  scale variables of interest. The functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks are wrappers
  of functions in 'keras'.
