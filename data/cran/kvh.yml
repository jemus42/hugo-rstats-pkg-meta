title: Read/Write Files in Key-Value-Hierarchy Format
maintainer: Serguei Sokol
description: |-
  The format KVH is a lightweight format that can be read/written both by humans and machines.
  It can be useful in situations where XML or alike formats seem to be an overkill.
  We provide an ability to parse KVH files in R pretty fast due to 'Rcpp' use.
