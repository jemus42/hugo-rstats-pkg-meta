version: 2.0.1
title: Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs
maintainer: Phil Chalmers
description: |-
  Provides tools to help safely and efficiently organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
  The package controls the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo simulations
  by utilizing a general generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions provided control
  common simulation issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results, support parallel
  back-end and MPI distributed computations, save and restore temporary files,
  aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide native support for debugging.
  For a pedagogical introduction to the package refer to
  Sigal and Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953>.
