title: Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for 'mlr3'
maintainer: Martin Binder
description: |-
  Dataflow programming toolkit that enriches 'mlr3' with a diverse
  set of pipelining operators ('PipeOps') that can be composed into graphs.
  Operations exist for data preprocessing, model fitting, and ensemble
  learning. Graphs can themselves be treated as 'mlr3' 'Learners' and can
  therefore be resampled, benchmarked, and tuned.
