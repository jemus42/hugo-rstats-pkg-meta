title: Tools for Writing MCMC
maintainer: Kurtis Shuler
description: |-
  Simplifies MCMC setup by automatically looping through sampling
  functions and saving the results.  Reduces the memory footprint of running
  MCMC and saves samples to disk as the chain runs.  Allows samples from the
  chain to be analyzed while the MCMC is still running.  Provides functions
  for commonly performed operations such as calculating Metropolis acceptance
  ratios and creating adaptive Metropolis samplers.  References: Roberts and
  Rosenthal (2009) <doi:10.1198/jcgs.2009.06134>.
