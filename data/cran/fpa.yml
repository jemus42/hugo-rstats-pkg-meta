title: Spatio-Temporal Fixation Pattern Analysis
maintainer: Jinlu Cao
description: |-
  Spatio-temporal Fixation Pattern Analysis (FPA) is a new method of analyzing eye
  movement data, developed by Mr. Jinlu Cao under the supervision of Prof. Chen Hsuan-Chih at
  The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Prof. Wang Suiping at the South China Normal
  Univeristy. The package "fpa" is a R implementation which makes FPA analysis much easier.
  There are four major functions in the package: ft2fp(), get_pattern(), plot_pattern(), and
  lineplot(). The function ft2fp() is the core function, which can complete all the preprocessing
  within moments. The other three functions are supportive functions which visualize the eye
  fixation patterns.
