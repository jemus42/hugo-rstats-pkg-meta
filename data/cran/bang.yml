title: Bayesian Analysis, No Gibbs
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of some simple
  commonly-used models, without using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  methods such as Gibbs sampling.  The 'rust' package
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is used to simulate a random
  sample from the required posterior distribution, using the generalized
  ratio-of-uniforms method.  See Wakefield, Gelfand and Smith (1991)
  <DOI:10.1007/BF01889987> for details. At the moment three conjugate
  hierarchical models are available: beta-binomial, gamma-Poisson and a 1-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA).
