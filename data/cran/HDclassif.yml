title: High Dimensional Supervised Classification and Clustering
maintainer: Laurent Berge
description: |-
  Discriminant analysis and data clustering methods for high
  dimensional data, based on the assumption that high-dimensional data live in
  different subspaces with low dimensionality proposing a new parametrization of
  the Gaussian mixture model which combines the ideas of dimension reduction and
  constraints on the model.
