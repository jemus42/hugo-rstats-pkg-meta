title: Set (Normal) Random Number Generator and Seed
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  SetRNG provides utilities to help set and record the setting of
  the seed and the uniform and normal generators used when a random
  experiment is run. The utilities can be used in other functions
  that do random experiments to simplify recording and/or setting all the
  necessary information for reproducibility.
  See the vignette and reference manual for examples.
