title: Mapping Fisheries Data and Spatial Analysis Tools
maintainer: Rowan Haigh
description: |-
  This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
  Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in 'Nanaimo', British Columbia, Canada. It
  extends the R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar
  to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).
  Embedded C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
  finding polygons that contain specified point events or converting between
  longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
  Additionally, we include 'C++' code developed by Angus Johnson for the
  'Clipper' library, data for a global shoreline, and other data sets in the
  public domain. Under the user's R library directory '.libPaths()',
  specifically in './PBSmapping/doc', a complete user's guide is offered and
  should be consulted to use package functions effectively.
