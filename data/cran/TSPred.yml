title: Functions for Benchmarking Time Series Prediction
maintainer: Rebecca Pontes Salles
description: Functions for time series preprocessing, decomposition, prediction and
  accuracy assessment using automatic linear modelling. The generated linear models
  and its yielded prediction errors can be used for benchmarking other time series
  prediction methods and for creating a demand for the refinement of such methods.
  For this purpose, benchmark data from prediction competitions may be used.
