description: |-
  R Commander plug-in for repeated-measures and mixed-design
  ('split-plot') ANOVA.
  It adds a new menu entry for repeated measures that allows
  to deal with up to three within-subject factors and optionally with
  one or several between-subject factors.
  It also provides supplementary options to oneWayAnova() and
  multiWayAnova() functions, such as choice of ANOVA type, display of
  effect sizes and post hoc analysis for multiWayAnova().
