title: One-Sided Multinomial Probabilities
maintainer: Alexander Davis
description: Implements multinomial CDF (P(N1<=n1, ..., Nk<=nk)) and tail probabilities
  (P(N1>n1, ..., Nk>nk)), as well as probabilities with both constraints (P(l1<N1<=u1,
  ..., lk<Nk<=uk)). Uses a method suggested by Bruce Levin (1981) <doi:10.1214/aos/1176345593>.
