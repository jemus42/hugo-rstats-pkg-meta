  Orthogonal Signal Deconvolution for Spectra Deconvolution in
  GC-MS and GCxGC-MS Data
maintainer: Xavier Domingo-Almenara
description: Compound deconvolution for chromatographic data, including gas chromatography
  - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and comprehensive gas chromatography - mass spectrometry
  (GCxGC-MS). The package includes functions to perform independent component analysis
  - orthogonal signal deconvolution (ICA-OSD), independent component regression (ICR),
  multivariate curve resolution (MCR-ALS) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD)
  alone.
