description: |-
  Automate the co-localization analysis of fluorescence microscopy
  images. Selecting regions of interest, extract pixel intensities from
  the image channels and calculate different co-localization statistics. The
  methods implemented in this package are based on Dunn et al. (2011)
  <doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00462.2010>.
