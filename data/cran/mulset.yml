version: 1.0.0
title: Multiset Intersection Generator
maintainer: Ivan Tomic
description: Computes efficient data distributions from highly inconsistent datasets
  with many missing values using multi-set intersections. Based upon hash functions,
  'mulset' can quickly identify intersections from very large matrices of input vectors
  across columns and rows and thus provides scalable solution for dealing with missing
  values. Tomic et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/545186>.
