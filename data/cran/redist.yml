title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Redistricting Simulation
maintainer: Ben Fifield
description: |-
  Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-
  specified target distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
  The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the
  redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
  requirements. The algorithm also can be used in combination with efficient
  simulation methods such as simulated and parallel tempering algorithms. Tools
  for analysis such as inverse probability reweighting and plotting functionality
  are included. The package implements methods described in Fifield, Higgins, Imai
  and Tarr (2016) ``A New Automated Redistricting Simulator Using Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo,'' working paper available at
  <https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/redist.pdf>.
