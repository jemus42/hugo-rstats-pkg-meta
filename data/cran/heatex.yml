title: Heat exchange calculations during physical activity.
maintainer: Kerry Atkins
description: |-
  The heatex package calculates heat storage in the body and
  the components of heat exchange (conductive, convective,
  radiative, and evaporative) between the body and the
  environment during physical activity based on the principles of
  partitional calorimetry. The program enables heat exchange
  calculations for a range of environmental conditions when
  wearing various clothing ensembles.
