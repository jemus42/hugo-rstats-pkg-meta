  Continuous Development Models for Incremental Time-Series
  Analysis
maintainer: Bijan Seyednasrollah
description: Using the Bayesian state-space approach, we developed a continuous development
  model to quantify dynamic incremental changes in the response variable. While the
  model was originally developed for daily changes in forest green-up, the model can
  be used to predict any similar process. The CDM can capture both timing and rate
  of nonlinear processes. Unlike statics methods, which aggregate variations into
  a single metric, our dynamic model tracks the changing impacts over time. The CDM
  accommodates nonlinear responses to variation in predictors, which changes throughout
  development.
