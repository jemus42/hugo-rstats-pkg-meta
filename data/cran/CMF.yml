title: Collective Matrix Factorization
maintainer: Felix Held
description: |-
  Collective matrix factorization (CMF) finds joint low-rank
  representations for a collection of matrices with shared row or column
  entities. This code learns a variational Bayesian approximation for CMF,
  supporting multiple likelihood potentials and missing data, while
  identifying both factors shared by multiple matrices and factors private
  for each matrix. For further details on the method see
  Klami et al. (2014) <arXiv:1312.5921>.
  The package can also be used to learn Bayesian canonical correlation
  analysis (CCA) and group factor analysis (GFA) models, both of which are
  special cases of CMF. This is likely to be useful for people looking for
  CCA and GFA solutions supporting missing data and non-Gaussian likelihoods.
  See Klami et al. (2013) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v14/klami13a.html> and
  Virtanen et al. (2012) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v22/virtanen12.html>
  for details on Bayesian CCA and GFA, respectively.
