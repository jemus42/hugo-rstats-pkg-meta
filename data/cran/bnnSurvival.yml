version: 0.1.5
title: Bagged k-Nearest Neighbors Survival Prediction
maintainer: Marvin N. Wright
description: |-
  Implements a bootstrap aggregated (bagged) version of
  the k-nearest neighbors survival probability prediction method (Lowsky et
  al. 2013). In addition to the bootstrapping of training samples, the
  features can be subsampled in each baselearner to break the correlation
  between them. The Rcpp package is used to speed up the computation.
