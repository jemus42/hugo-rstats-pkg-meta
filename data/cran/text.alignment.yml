title: Text Alignment with Smith-Waterman
maintainer: Jan Wijffels
description: |-
  Find similarities between texts using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The algorithm performs local sequence alignment and determines similar regions between two strings.
  The Smith-Waterman algorithm is explained in the paper: "Identification of common molecular subsequences" by T.F.Smith and M.S.Waterman (1981), available at <doi:10.1016/0022-2836(81)90087-5>.
  This package implements the same logic for sequences of words and letters instead of molecular sequences.
