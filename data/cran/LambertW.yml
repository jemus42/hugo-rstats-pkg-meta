  Probabilistic Models to Analyze and Gaussianize Heavy-Tailed,
  Skewed Data
maintainer: Georg M. Goerg
description: |-
  Lambert W x F distributions are a generalized framework to analyze
  skewed, heavy-tailed data. It is based on an input/output system, where the
  output random variable (RV) Y is a non-linearly transformed version of an input
  RV X ~ F with similar properties as X, but slightly skewed (heavy-tailed).
  The transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution. This package contains
  functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-tailed data the Lambert Way:
  simulate random samples, estimate parameters, compute quantiles, and plot/
  print results nicely. Probably the most important function is 'Gaussianize',
  which works similarly to 'scale', but actually makes the data Gaussian.
  A do-it-yourself toolkit allows users to define their own Lambert W x
  'MyFavoriteDistribution' and use it in their analysis right away.
