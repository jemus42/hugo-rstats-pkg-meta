title: Access Reactive Data Interactively
maintainer: Jake Riley
description: Troubleshooting reactive data in 'shiny' can be difficult. These functions
  will convert reactive data frames into functions and load all assigned objects into
  your local environment. If you create a dummy input object, as the function will
  suggest, you will be able to test your server and ui functions interactively.
