title: Parametric Mortality Models, Life Tables and HMD
maintainer: Marius D. Pascariu
description: |-
  Fit the most popular human mortality 'laws', and construct
  full and abridge life tables given various input indices. A mortality
  law is a parametric function that describes the dying-out process of
  individuals in a population during a significant portion of their
  life spans. For a comprehensive review of the most important mortality
  laws see Tabeau (2001) <doi:10.1007/0-306-47562-6_1>.
  Practical functions for downloading data from various human mortality
  databases are provided as well.
