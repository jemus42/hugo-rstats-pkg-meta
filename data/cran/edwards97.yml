maintainer: Dewey Dunnington
description: |-
  Implements the Edwards (1997) <doi:10.1002/j.1551-8833.1997.tb08229.x>
  Langmuir-based semi-empirical coagulation model, which predicts the concentration
  of organic carbon remaining in water after treatment with an Al- or Fe-based
  coagulant. Data and methods are provided to optimise empirical coefficients.
