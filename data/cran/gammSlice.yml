title: Generalized Additive Mixed Model Analysis via Slice Sampling
maintainer: Matt P. Wand
description: |-
  Uses a slice sampling-based Markov chain Monte Carlo to
  conduct Bayesian fitting and inference for generalized additive
  mixed models.  Generalized linear mixed models and generalized
  additive models are also handled as special cases of generalized
  additive mixed models. The methodology and software is described
  in Pham, T.H. and Wand, M.P. (2018). Australian and New Zealand
  Journal of Statistics, 60, 279-330 <DOI:10.1111/ANZS.12241>.
