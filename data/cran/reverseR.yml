title: Linear Regression Stability to Significance Reversal
maintainer: Andrej-Nikolai Spiess
description: Tests linear regressions for significance reversal through leave-one(multiple)-out
  and shifting/addition of response values. The paradigm of the package is loosely
  based on the somewhat forgotten "dfstat" criterion (Belsley, Kuh & Welsch 1980 <doi:10.1002/0471725153.ch2>),
  which tests influential values in linear models from their effect on statistical
  inference, i.e. changes in p-value.
