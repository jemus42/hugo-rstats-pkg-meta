  Thresholded variable selection and prediction based on
  estimating equations
maintainer: Julian Wolfson
description: |-
  This package implements a thresholded version of the EEBoost
  algorithm described in [Wolfson (2011, JASA)]. EEBoost is a general-purpose
  method for variable selection which can be applied whenever inference would
  be based on an estimating equation. The package currently implements
  variable selection based on the Generalized Estimating Equations, but can
  also accommodate user-provided estimating functions. Thresholded EEBoost is
  a generalization which allows multiple variables to enter the model at each
  boosting step.
