title: Compute the NPMLE of distribution from doubly censored data
maintainer: Mai Zhou
description: Use EM algorithm to compute the NPMLE of CDF and also the<U+000a>two
  censoring distributions. For doubly censored data (as<U+000a>described in Chang
  and Yang (1987) Ann. Stat. 1536-47). You can<U+000a>also specify a constraint, it
  will return the constrained NPMLE<U+000a>and the -2 log empirical likelihood ratio.
  This can be used to<U+000a>test the hypothesis about the constraint and find confidence<U+000a>intervals
  for probability or quantile via empirical likelihood<U+000a>ratio theorem. Influence
  function of hat F may also be<U+000a>calculated (but may be slow).
