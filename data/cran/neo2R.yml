title: Neo4j to R
maintainer: Patrice Godard
description: |-
  The aim of the neo2R is to provide simple and low level connectors
  for querying neo4j graph databases (<https://neo4j.com/>).
  The objects returned by the query functions are either lists or data.frames
  with very few post-processing.
  It allows fast processing of queries returning many records.
  And it let the user handle post-processing according to the data model
  and his needs.
