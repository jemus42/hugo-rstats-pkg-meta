title: Maximum Entropy Bootstrap for Time Series
maintainer: Javier LÃ³pez-de-Lacalle
description: |-
  Maximum entropy density based dependent data bootstrap.
  An algorithm is provided to create a population of time series (ensemble)
  without assuming stationarity. The reference paper (Vinod, H.D., 2004) explains
  how the algorithm satisfies the ergodic theorem and the central limit theorem.
