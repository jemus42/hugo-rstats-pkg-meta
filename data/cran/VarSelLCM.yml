description: Full model selection (detection of the relevant features and estimation
  of the number of clusters) for model-based clustering (see reference here <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9670-1>).
  Data to analyze can be continuous, categorical, integer or mixed. Moreover, missing
  values can occur and do not necessitate any pre-processing. Shiny application permits
