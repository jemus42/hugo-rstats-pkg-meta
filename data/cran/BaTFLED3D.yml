title: Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data

description: BaTFLED is a machine learning algorithm designed to make predictions
  and determine interactions in data that varies along three independent modes. For
  example BaTFLED was developed to predict the growth of cell lines when treated with
  drugs at different doses. The first mode corresponds to cell lines and incorporates
  predictors such as cell line genomics and growth conditions. The second mode corresponds
  to drugs and incorporates predictors indicating known targets and structural features.
  The third mode corresponds to dose and there are no dose-specific predictors (although
  the algorithm is capable of including predictors for the third mode if present).
  See 'BaTFLED3D_vignette.rmd' for a simulated example.
