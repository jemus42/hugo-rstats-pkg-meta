  Advanced Policing Techniques for the Board Game "Letters from
  Whitechapel"
maintainer: Mark Ewing
description: |-
  Provides a set of functions to make tracking the hidden movements
  of the 'Jack' player easier. By tracking every possible path Jack might have
  traveled from the point of the initial murder including special movement such
  as through alleyways and via carriages, the police can more accurately narrow
  the field of their search. Additionally, by tracking all possible hideouts from
  round to round, rounds 3 and 4 should have a vastly reduced field of search.
