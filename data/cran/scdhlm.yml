title: Estimating Hierarchical Linear Models for Single-Case Designs
maintainer: James Pustejovsky
description: |-
  Provides a set of tools for estimating hierarchical linear
  models and effect sizes based on data from single-case designs.
  Functions are provided for calculating standardized mean difference effect sizes that
  are directly comparable to standardized mean differences estimated from between-subjects randomized experiments,
  as described in Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2012) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1052>;
  Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2013) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1086>; and
  Pustejovsky, Hedges, and Shadish (2014) <DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577>.
  Includes an interactive web interface.
