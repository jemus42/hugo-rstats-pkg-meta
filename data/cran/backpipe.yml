version: 0.2.3
title: Backward Pipe (Right-to-Left) Operator
maintainer: Christopher Brown
description: |-
  Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or
  'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows for a performing operations from right-to-left.
  This allows writing more legible code where right-to-left ordering is
  natural. This is common with hierarchies and nested structures such as
  trees, directories or markup languages (e.g. HTML and XML).
  The package also includes a R-Studio add-in that can be bound to a keyboard
  shortcut.
