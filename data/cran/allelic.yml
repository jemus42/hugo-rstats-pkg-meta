maintainer: Mickael Guedj
description: This is the implementation in R+C of a new association<U+000a>test described
  in "A fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact<U+000a>test for case-control association
  studies" (Submitted).  It<U+000a>appears that in most cases the classical chi-square
  test used<U+000a>for testing for allelic association on genotype data is biased.<U+000a>Our
  test is unbiased, exact but fast throught careful<U+000a>optimization.
