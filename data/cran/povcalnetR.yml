title: Client for the 'Povcalnet' API
maintainer: Tony Fujs
description: Provides an interface to compute poverty and inequality indicators for
  more than 160 countries and regions from the World Bank's database of household
  surveys. It has the same functionality as the 'Povcalnet' website (<http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/>).
  'Povcalnet' is a computational tool that allows users to estimate poverty rates
  for regions, sets of countries or individual countries, over time and at any poverty
  line. 'Povcalnet' is managed jointly by the data and research group in the World
  Bank's development economics division. It draws heavily upon a strong collaboration
  with the poverty and equity global practice, which is responsible for the gathering
  and harmonization of the underlying survey data.
