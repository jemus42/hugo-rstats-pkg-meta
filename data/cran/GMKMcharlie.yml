title: Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture and Minkowski K-Means
maintainer: Charlie Wusuo Liu
description: High performance trainers for parameterizing and clustering weighted
  data. The Gaussian mixture (GM) module includes the conventional EM (expectation
  maximization) trainer, the component-wise EM trainer, the minimum-message-length
  EM trainer by Figueiredo and Jain (2002) <doi:10.1109/34.990138>. These trainers
  accept additional constraints on mixture weights and covariance eigen ratios. The
  K-means (KM) module offers clustering with the options of (i) deterministic and
  stochastic K-means++ initializations, (ii) upper bounds on cluster weights (sizes),
  (iii) Minkowski distances, (iv) cosine dissimilarity, (v) dense and sparse representation
  of data input. The package improved the usual implementations of GM and KM training
  algorithms in various aspects. It is carefully crafted in multithreaded C++ for
  processing large data in industry use.
