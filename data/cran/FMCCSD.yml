title: Efficient Estimation of Clustered Current Status Data
maintainer: Tong Wang
description: |-
  Current status data abounds
  in the field of epidemiology and public health, where the only observable data for a subject is
  the random inspection time and the event status at inspection. Motivated by such a current status
  data from a periodontal study where data are inherently clustered,
  we propose a unified methodology to analyze such complex data.
