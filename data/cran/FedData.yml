  (SSURGO) database from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is
  led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA; the
  Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), coordinated by National Climatic
  Data Center at NOAA; the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters
  for North America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
  Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC); the International Tree Ring Data Bank;
  and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).
