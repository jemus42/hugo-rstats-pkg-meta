title: Weighted Subspace Random Forest for Classification
maintainer: He Zhao
description: |2-

  A parallel implementation of Weighted Subspace Random Forest.  The
  Weighted Subspace Random Forest algorithm was proposed in the
  International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining by Baoxun Xu,
  Joshua Zhexue Huang, Graham Williams, Qiang Wang, and Yunming Ye
  (2012) <DOI:10.4018/jdwm.2012040103>.  The algorithm can classify
  very high-dimensional data with random forests built using small
  subspaces.  A novel variable weighting method is used for variable
  subspace selection in place of the traditional random variable
  sampling.This new approach is particularly useful in building
  models from high-dimensional data.
