title: '''TRFLP'' Analysis and Matching Package for R'
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Matching terminal restriction fragment length
  polymorphism ('TRFLP') profiles between unknown samples and a
  database of known samples.  'TRAMPR' facilitates analysis of
  many unknown profiles at once, and provides tools for working
  directly with electrophoresis output through to generating
  summaries suitable for community analyses with R's rich set of
  statistical functions.  'TRAMPR' also resolves the issues of
  multiple 'TRFLP' profiles within a species, and shared 'TRFLP'
  profiles across species.
