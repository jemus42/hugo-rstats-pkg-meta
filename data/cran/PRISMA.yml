description: |-
  Loads and processes huge text
  corpora processed with the sally toolbox (<http://www.mlsec.org/sally/>).
  sally acts as a very fast preprocessor which splits the text files into
  tokens or n-grams. These output files can then be read with the PRISMA
  package which applies testing-based token selection and has some
  replicate-aware, highly tuned non-negative matrix factorization and
  principal component analysis implementation which allows the processing of
  very big data sets even on desktop machines.
