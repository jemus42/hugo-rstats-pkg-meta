title: Cone Constrained Convex Problems
maintainer: Bernhard Pfaff
description: Routines for solving convex optimization problems with cone constraints
  by means of interior-point methods. The implemented algorithms are partially ported
  from CVXOPT, a Python module for convex optimization (see <http://cvxopt.org> for
  more information).
