title: Fitting Dynamic Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm
maintainer: Theodor Adrian Balan
description: Fits semiparametric dynamic frailty models according to the methodology
  of Putter and van Houwelingen (2015) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv002>. Intermediate
  models, where the frailty is piecewise constant on prespecified intervals, are also
  supported. The frailty process is taken to have a specific auto-correlation structure,
  and the supported distributions include gamma, inverse Gaussian, power variance
  family (PVF) and positive stable.
