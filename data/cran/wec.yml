title: Weighted Effect Coding
maintainer: Rense Nieuwenhuis
description: Provides functions to create factor variables with contrasts based on
  weighted effect coding, and their interactions. In weighted effect coding the estimates
  from a first order regression model show the deviations per group from the sample
  mean. This is especially useful when a researcher has no directional hypotheses
  and uses a sample from a population in which the number of observation per group
  is different.
