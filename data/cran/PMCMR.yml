maintainer: Thorsten Pohlert
description: |-
  Note, that the 'PMCMR' package is superseded
  by the novel 'PMCMRplus' package. The 'PMCMRplus'
  package contains all functions from
  'PMCMR' and many more parametric and non-parametric
  multiple comparison procedures, one-factorial trend
  tests, as well as improved method functions,
  such as print, summary and plot.
  The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained,
  but kept for compatibility of reverse depending
  packages for some time.
