title: Models for Drying and Soaking Kinetics of Seeds
maintainer: Anderson Rodrigo da Silva
description: |-
  Bringing together tools for modeling drying and soaking (rehydration)
  kinetics of seeds. This package contains several widely used predictive models
  (e.g.: da Silva et al., 2018). As these are nonlinear, the functions are interactive-based
  and easy-to-use. Least squares estimates are obtained with just a few visual adjustments
  of the initial parameter values.
