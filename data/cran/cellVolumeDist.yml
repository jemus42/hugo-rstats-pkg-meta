title: Functions to fit cell volume distributions and thereby estimate<U+000a>cell
  growth rates and division times
maintainer: Katharine M. Mullen
description: This package implements a methodology for using cell<U+000a>volume distributions
  to estimate cell growth rates and division<U+000a>times that is described in the
  paper entitled "Cell Volume<U+000a>Distributions Reveal Cell Growth Rates and Division
  Times", by<U+000a>Michael Halter, John T. Elliott, Joseph B. Hubbard, Alessandro<U+000a>Tona
  and Anne L. Plant, which is in press in the Journal of<U+000a>Theoretical Biology.  In
  order to reproduce the analysis used<U+000a>to obtain Table 1 in the paper, execute
  the command<U+000a>"example(fitVolDist)".
