title: Project Future Case Incidence
maintainer: Thibaut Jombart
description: Provides functions and graphics for projecting daily incidence based
  on past incidence, and estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number.
  Projections are based on a branching process using a Poisson-distributed number
  of new cases per day, similar to the model used for estimating R0 in 'EpiEstim'
  or in 'earlyR', and described by Nouvellet et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.012>.
