title: Determine Event Boundaries in Event Segmentation Experiments
maintainer: Frank Papenmeier
description: |-
  Contains functions that help to determine event
  boundaries in event segmentation experiments by bootstrapping a critical
  segmentation magnitude under the null hypothesis that all key presses were
  randomly distributed across the experiment. Segmentation magnitude is
  defined as the sum of Gaussians centered at the times of the segmentation
  key presses performed by the participants. Within a participant, the maximum
  of the overlaid Gaussians is used to prevent an excessive influence of a
  single participant on the overall outcome (e.g. if a participant is pressing
  the key multiple times in succession). Further functions are included, such
  as plotting the results.
