title: Many-to-One Comparisons of Proportions
maintainer: Frank Schaarschmidt
description: |-
  Asymptotic simultaneous confidence intervals for comparison of many treatments with one control,
  for the difference of binomial proportions, allows for Dunnett-like-adjustment, Bonferroni or unadjusted intervals.
  Simulation of power of the above interval methods, approximate calculation of any-pair-power, and sample size
  iteration based on approximate any-pair power. Exact conditional maximum test for many-to-one comparisons to a control.
