title: Computation of Bayes Factors for Common Biomedical Designs
maintainer: Maximilian Linde
description: |-
  BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R. Convenience functions
  for the computation of Bayes factors for common biomedical research
  designs. Implemented are functions to test the equivalence (equiv_bf),
  non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority (super_bf) of an experimental
  group compared to a control group. Bayes factors for these three tests can
  be computed based on raw data (x, y) or summary statistics (n_x, n_y,
  mean_x, mean_y, sd_x, sd_y [or ci_margin and ci_level]), making it possible
  to reanalyse findings (e.g., from publications) without the need to obtain
  the raw data.
