title: Drag-and-Drop in 'shiny' Apps with 'SortableJS'
maintainer: Andrie de Vries
description: |-
  Enables drag-and-drop behaviour in Shiny apps, by exposing the
  functionality of the 'SortableJS' <https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/>
  JavaScript library as an 'htmlwidget' <http://htmlwidgets.org>.
  You can use this in Shiny apps and widgets, 'learnr' tutorials as well as
  R Markdown. In addition, provides a custom 'learnr' question type -
  'question_rank()' - that allows ranking questions with drag-and-drop.
