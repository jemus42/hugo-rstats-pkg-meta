  Inferring an Animal's Sites of Interest from High Resolution
  Data
maintainer: Rhys Munden
description: Within the area of movement ecology, it can be useful to identify an
  animal's sites of interest. These will be places that an animal uses a lot and so
  will spend a proportionately longer time there. The aim of this package is to identify
  both the position and size of these sites of interest from high resolution (sub-second)
  positional data.
