title: Selecting Variable Subsets
maintainer: Jorge Cadima
description: A collection of functions which (i) assess the quality of variable subsets
  as surrogates for a full data set, in either an exploratory data analysis or in
  the context of a multivariate linear model, and (ii) search for subsets which are
  optimal under various criteria. Theoretical support for the heuristic search methods
  and exploratory data analysis criteria is in Cadima, Cerdeira, Minhoto (2003, <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2003.11.001>).
  Theoretical support for the leap and bounds algorithm and the criteria for the general
  multivariate linear model is in Duarte Silva (2001, <doi:10.1006/jmva.2000.1920>).
  There is a package vignette "subselect", which includes additional references.
