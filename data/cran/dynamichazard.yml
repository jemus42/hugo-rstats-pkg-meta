title: Dynamic Hazard Models using State Space Models
maintainer: Benjamin Christoffersen
description: |-
  Contains functions that lets you fit dynamic hazard models using
  state space models. The first implemented model is described in Fahrmeir
  (1992) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475232> and Fahrmeir (1994)
  <doi:10.1093/biomet/81.2.317>. Extensions hereof are available where the
  Extended Kalman filter is replaced by an unscented Kalman filter and other
  options including particle filters. The implemented particle filters support
  more general state space models.
