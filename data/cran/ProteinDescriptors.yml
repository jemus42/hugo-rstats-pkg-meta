  Generates Various Protein Descriptors for Machine Learning
  Algorithms
maintainer: Berat Kurar
description: |-
  An implementation of protein descriptors in R. These descriptors
  combine the advantages of being fixed length and including partial sequential
  effect: Various length of protein sequences are described with fixed length
  vectors that are suitable for machine learning algorithms, and still includes
  partial sequential effect.
