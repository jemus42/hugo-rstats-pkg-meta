title: Geospatial Queries Using 'PyMongo'
maintainer: Lampros Mouselimis
description: Utilizes methods of the 'PyMongo' 'Python' library to initialize, insert
  and query 'GeoJson' data (see <https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/#> for more
  information on 'PyMongo'). Furthermore, it allows the user to validate 'GeoJson'
  objects and to use the console for 'MongoDB' (bulk) commands. The 'reticulate' package
  provides the 'R' interface to 'Python' modules, classes and functions.
