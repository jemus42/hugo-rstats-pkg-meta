title: Tools for Defensive Programming
maintainer: Colin Fay
description: |-
  Tools for defensive programming, inspired by 'purrr' mappers and
  based on 'rlang'.'attempt' extends and facilitates defensive programming by
  providing a consistent grammar, and provides a set of easy to use functions
  for common tests and conditions. 'attempt' only depends on 'rlang', and
  focuses on speed, so it can be easily integrated in other functions and
  used in data analysis.
