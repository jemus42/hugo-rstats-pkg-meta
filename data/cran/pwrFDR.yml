description: |-
  This is a package for calculating power and sample size
  in multiple testing situations using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
  false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. The package computes power
  and sample size in one of either two ways, using the average
  power or the lambda-power. See Izmirlian, G. (2018) <arXiv:1801.03989>.
