  Functions for processing, analysis and visualization of Hydrogen Deuterium eXchange monitored by
  Mass Spectrometry experiments (HDX-MS). 'HaDeX' introduces a new standardized and reproducible workflow
  for the analysis of the HDX-MS data, including novel uncertainty intervals. Additionally, it covers
  data exploration, quality control and generation of publication-quality figures. All functionalities
  are also available in the in-built 'Shiny' app.
