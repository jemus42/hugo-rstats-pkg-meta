title: Inference and Learning in Stochastic Automata
maintainer: Muhammad Kashif Hanif
description: Machine learning provides algorithms that can learn from data and make
  inferences or predictions. Stochastic automata is a class of input/output devices
  which can model components. This work provides implementation an inference algorithm
  for stochastic automata which is similar to the Viterbi algorithm. Moreover, we
  specify a learning algorithm using the expectation-maximization technique and provide
  a more efficient implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for stochastic automata.
  This work is based on Inference and learning in stochastic automata was by Karl-Heinz
  Zimmermann(2017) <doi:10.12732/ijpam.v115i3.15>.
