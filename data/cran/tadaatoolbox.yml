  Contains functions for the easy display of statistical tests as well as
  some convenience functions for data cleanup. It is meant to ease existing workflows
  with packages like 'sjPlot', 'dplyr', and 'ggplot2'. The primary components are the functions
  prefixed with 'tadaa_', which are built to work in an interactive environment, but also print
  tidy markdown tables powered by 'pixiedust' for the creation of 'RMarkdown' reports.
