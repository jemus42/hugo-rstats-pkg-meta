title: An Exponential Stochastic Block Model for Interaction Lengths
maintainer: Riccardo Rastelli
description: Given a continuous-time dynamic network, this package allows one to fit
  a stochastic blockmodel where nodes belonging to the same group create interactions
  and non-interactions of similar lengths. This package implements the methodology
  described by R. Rastelli and M. Fop (2019) <arXiv:1901.09828>.
