title: Bayesian Sampling for Stick-Breaking Mixtures
maintainer: Matt Taddy
description: |-
  This is a bare-bones implementation of sampling algorithms
  for a variety of Bayesian stick-breaking (marginally DP)
  mixture models, including particle learning and Gibbs sampling
  for static DP mixtures, particle learning for dynamic BAR
  stick-breaking, and DP mixture regression.  The software is
  designed to be easy to customize to suit different situations
  and for experimentation with stick-breaking models.  Since
  particles are repeatedly copied, it is not an especially
  efficient implementation.
