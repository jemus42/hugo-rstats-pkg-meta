title: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling
maintainer: Genaro Sucarrat
description: Flexible and robust estimation and inference of generalised autoregressive
  conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with covariates based on the results
  by Francq and Thieu (2018) <doi:10.1017/S0266466617000512>. Coefficients can straightforwardly
  be set to zero by omission, and quasi maximum likelihood methods ensure estimates
  are generally consistent and inference valid, even when the standardised innovations
  are non-normal and/or dependent over time.
