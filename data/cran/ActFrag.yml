  Activity Fragmentation Metrics Extracted from Minute Level
  Activity Data
maintainer: Junrui Di
description: |-
  Recent studies haven shown that, on top of total daily active/sedentary volumes, the time
  accumulation strategies provide more sensitive information. This package provides functions to extract
  commonly used fragmentation metrics to quantify such time accumulation strategies based on minute level
  actigraphy-measured activity counts data.
