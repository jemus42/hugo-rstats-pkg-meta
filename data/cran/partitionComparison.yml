title: Implements Measures for the Comparison of Two Partitions
maintainer: Fabian Ball
description: |-
  Provides several measures ((dis)similarity, distance/metric,
  correlation, entropy) for comparing two partitions of the same set of
  objects. The different measures can be assigned to three different
  classes: Pair comparison (containing the famous Jaccard and Rand
  indices), set based, and information theory based.
  Many of the implemented measures can be found in
  Albatineh AN, Niewiadomska-Bugaj M and Mihalko D (2006)
  <doi:10.1007/s00357-006-0017-z> and
  Meila M (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.013>.
  Partitions are represented by vectors of class labels which allow a
  straightforward integration with existing clustering algorithms
  (e.g. kmeans()). The package is mostly based on the S4 object system.
