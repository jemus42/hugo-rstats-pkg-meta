title: Mixed Conditional Logit Models
maintainer: Martin Elff
description: |-
  Specification and estimation of conditional logit models of binary
  responses and multinomial counts is provided, with or without
  random effects. The current implementation of the estimator for random
  effects variances uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL) approach and thus should
  be used only if groups sizes are large.
