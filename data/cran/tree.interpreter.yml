  Random Forest Prediction Decomposition and Feature Importance
  Measure
maintainer: Qingyao Sun
description: |-
  An R re-implementation of the 'treeinterpreter' package on PyPI
  <https://pypi.org/project/treeinterpreter/>. Each prediction can be
  decomposed as 'prediction = bias + feature_1_contribution + ... +
  feature_n_contribution'. This decomposition is then used to calculate
  the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) and Mean Decrease Impurity using
  out-of-bag samples (MDI-oob) feature importance measures based on the
  work of Li et al. (2019) <arXiv:1906.10845>.
