title: Process an MCMC Sample of Clusterings
maintainer: Arno Fritsch
description: |-
  Implements methods for processing a sample of (hard)
  clusterings, e.g. the MCMC output of a Bayesian clustering
  model. Among them are methods that find a single best
  clustering to represent the sample, which are based on the
  posterior similarity matrix or a relabelling algorithm.
