title: Feature-Based Forecast Model Selection
maintainer: Thiyanga Talagala
description: A novel meta-learning framework for forecast model selection using time
  series features. Many applications require a large number of time series to be forecast.
  Providing better forecasts for these time series is important in decision and policy
  making. We propose a classification framework which selects forecast models based
  on features calculated from the time series. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based
  FORecast Model Selection). FFORMS builds a mapping that relates the features of
  time series to the best forecast model using a random forest. 'seer' package is
  the implementation of the FFORMS algorithm. For more details see our paper at <https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics/research/publications/ebs/wp06-2018.pdf>.
