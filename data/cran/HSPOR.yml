title: Hidden Smooth Polynomial Regression for Rupture Detection
maintainer: Florine Greciet
description: Several functions that allow by different methods to infer a piecewise
  polynomial regression model under regularity constraints, namely continuity or differentiability
  of the link function. The implemented functions are either specific to data with
  two regimes, or generic for any number of regimes, which can be given by the user
  or learned by the algorithm. A paper describing all these methods will be submitted
  soon. The reference will be added to this file as soon as available.
