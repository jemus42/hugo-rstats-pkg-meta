  Fitting a Quadrilateral Dissimilarity Model to Same-Different
  Judgments
maintainer: Nora Umbach
description: |-
  This package provides different specifications of a Quadrilateral
  Dissimilarity Model which can be used to fit same-different judgments
  in order to get a predicted matrix that satisfies regular minimality
  [Colonius & Dzhafarov, 2006, Measurement and representations of
  sensations, Erlbaum]. From such a matrix, Fechnerian distances can be
  computed.
