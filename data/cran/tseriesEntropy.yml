title: Entropy Based Analysis and Tests for Time Series
maintainer: Simone Giannerini
description: Implements an Entropy measure of dependence based on the Bhattacharya-Hellinger-Matusita
  distance. Can be used as a (nonlinear) autocorrelation/crosscorrelation function
  for continuous and categorical time series. The package includes tests for serial
  dependence and nonlinearity based on it. Some routines have a parallel version that
  can be used in a multicore/cluster environment. The package makes use of S4 classes.
