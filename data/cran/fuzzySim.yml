title: Fuzzy Similarity in Species Distributions
maintainer: A. Marcia Barbosa
description: Functions to calculate fuzzy versions of species' occurrence patterns
  based on presence-absence data (including inverse distance interpolation, trend
  surface analysis and prevalence-independent favourability GLM), and pair-wise fuzzy
  similarity (based on fuzzy versions of commonly used similarity indices) among those
  occurrence patterns. Includes also functions for model comparison (overlap and fuzzy
  similarity, loss or gain), and for data preparation, such as obtaining unique abbreviations
  of species names, converting species lists (long format) to presence-absence tables
  (wide format), transposing part of a data frame, assessing the false discovery rate,
  or analysing and dealing with multicollinearity among variables. Includes also sample
  datasets for providing practical examples.
