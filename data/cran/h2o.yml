maintainer: Erin LeDell
description: |-
  R interface for 'H2O', the scalable open source machine learning
  platform that offers parallelized implementations of many supervised and
  unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear
  Models, Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost), Random Forests,
  Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning), Stacked Ensembles, Naive Bayes, Cox
  Proportional Hazards, K-Means, PCA, Word2Vec, as well as a fully automatic
  machine learning algorithm (AutoML).
