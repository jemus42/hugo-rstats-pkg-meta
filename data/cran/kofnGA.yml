title: A Genetic Algorithm for Fixed-Size Subset Selection
maintainer: Mark A. Wolters
description: |-
  Provides a function that uses a genetic algorithm to search for a subset
  of size k from the integers 1:n, such that a user-supplied objective function
  is minimized at that subset.  The selection step is done by tournament selection
  based on ranks, and elitism may be used to retain a portion of the best solutions
  from one generation to the next. Population objective function values may
  optionally be evaluated in parallel.
