title: Estimating Copula Entropy
maintainer: MA Jian
description: 'The nonparametric method for estimating copula entropy is implemented.
  The method composes of two simple steps: estimating empirical copula by rank statistic
  and estimating copula entropy with k-Nearest-Neighbour method. Copula Entropy is
  a mathematical concept for multivariate statistical independence measuring and testing,
  and proved to be equivalent to mutual information. Estimating copula entropy can
  be applied to many cases, including but not limited to variable selection and causal
  discovery (by estimating transfer entropy). Please refer to Ma and Sun (2011) <doi:
  10.1016/S1007-0214(11)70008-6> for more information.'
