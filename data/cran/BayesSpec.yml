title: Bayesian Spectral Analysis Techniques
maintainer: Andrew Ferris
description: 'An implementation of methods for spectral analysis using the Bayesian
  framework. It includes functions for modelling spectrum as well as appropriate plotting
  and output estimates. There is segmentation capability with RJ MCMC (Reversible
  Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo). The package takes these methods predominantly from
  the 2012 paper "AdaptSPEC: Adaptive Spectral Estimation for Nonstationary Time Series"
  <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2012.716340>.'
