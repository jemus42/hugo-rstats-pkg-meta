title: Run Predictions Inside the Database
maintainer: Max Kuhn
description: |-
  It parses a fitted 'R' model object, and returns a formula
  in 'Tidy Eval' code that calculates the predictions.
  It works with several databases back-ends because it leverages 'dplyr'
  and 'dbplyr' for the final 'SQL' translation of the algorithm. It currently
  supports lm(), glm(), randomForest(), ranger(), earth(), xgb.Booster.complete(),
  cubist(), and ctree() models.
