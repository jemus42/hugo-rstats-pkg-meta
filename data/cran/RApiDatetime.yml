maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  Access to the C-level R date and datetime code is provided for
  C-level API use by other packages via registration of native functions.
  Client packages simply include a single header 'RApiDatetime.h' provided
  by this package, and also 'import' it.  The R Core group is the original
  author of the code made available with slight modifications by this package.
