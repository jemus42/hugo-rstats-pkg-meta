  Performs the Joint Graphical Lasso for Sparse Inverse Covariance
  Estimation on Multiple Classes
maintainer: Patrick Danaher
description: |-
  The Joint Graphical Lasso is a generalized method for
  estimating Gaussian graphical models/ sparse inverse covariance
  matrices/ biological networks on multiple classes of data.  We
  solve JGL under two penalty functions: The Fused Graphical
  Lasso (FGL), which employs a fused penalty to encourage inverse
  covariance matrices to be similar across classes, and the Group
  Graphical Lasso (GGL), which encourages similar network
  structure between classes.  FGL is recommended over GGL for
  most applications. Reference: Danaher P, Wang P, Witten DM. (2013)
