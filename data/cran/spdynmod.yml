title: Spatio-Dynamic Wetland Plant Communities Model
maintainer: Javier Martinez-Lopez
description: |-
  A spatio-dynamic modelling package that focuses on three
  characteristic wetland plant communities in a semiarid Mediterranean
  wetland in response to hydrological pressures from the catchment. The
  package includes the data on watershed hydrological pressure and the
  initial raster maps of plant communities but also allows for random initial
  distribution of plant communities. For more detailed info see: Martinez-Lopez et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.11.024>.
