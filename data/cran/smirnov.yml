  Provides two taxonomic coefficients from E. S. Smirnov
  "Taxonomic analysis" (1969) book
maintainer: Alexey Shipunov
description: |-
  This tiny package contains one function smirnov() which
  calculates two scaled taxonomic coefficients, Txy (coefficient
  of similarity) and Txx (coefficient of originality). These two
  characteristics may be used for the analysis of similarities
  between any number of taxonomic groups, and also for assessing
  uniqueness of giving taxon. It is possible to use smirnov()
  output as a distance measure: convert it to distance by
  "as.dist(1 - smirnov(x))".
