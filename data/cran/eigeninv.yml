title: Generates (dense) matrices that have a given set of eigenvalues
maintainer: Ravi Varadhan
description: Solves the ``inverse eigenvalue problem'' which is to<U+000a>generate
  a real-valued matrix that has the specified real<U+000a>eigenvalue spectrum.  It
  can generate infinitely many dense<U+000a>matrices, symmetric or asymmetric, with
  the given set of<U+000a>eigenvalues.  Algorithm can also generate stochastic and
  doubly<U+000a>stochastic matrices.
