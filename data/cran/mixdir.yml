title: Cluster High Dimensional Categorical Datasets
maintainer: Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze
description: |-
  Scalable Bayesian clustering of categorical datasets. The package implements a hierarchical Dirichlet
  (Process) mixture  of multinomial distributions. It is thus a probabilistic latent class model (LCM) and can be used
  to reduce the  dimensionality of hierarchical data and cluster individuals into latent classes. It can automatically
  infer an appropriate number of latent classes or find k classes, as defined by the user.  The model is based on a
  paper by Dunson and Xing (2009) <doi:10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08439>, but implements a scalable variational inference algorithm so that it is
  applicable to large datasets. It is described and tested in the accompanying paper by
  Ahlmann-Eltze and Yau (2018) <doi:10.1109/DSAA.2018.00068>.
