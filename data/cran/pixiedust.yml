title: Tables so Beautifully Fine-Tuned You Will Believe It's Magic
maintainer: Benjamin Nutter
description: |-
  The introduction of the 'broom' package has made converting model
  objects into data frames as simple as a single function. While the 'broom'
  package focuses on providing tidy data frames that can be used in advanced
  analysis, it deliberately stops short of providing functionality for reporting
  models in publication-ready tables. 'pixiedust' provides this functionality with
  a programming interface intended to be similar to 'ggplot2's system of layers
  with fine tuned control over each cell of the table. Options for output include
  printing to the console and to the common markdown formats (markdown, HTML, and
  LaTeX). With a little 'pixiedust' (and happy thoughts) tables can really fly.
