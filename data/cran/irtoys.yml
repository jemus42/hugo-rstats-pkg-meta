title: A Collection of Functions Related to Item Response Theory (IRT)
maintainer: Ivailo Partchev
description: |-
  A collection of functions useful in learning and practicing IRT,
  which can be combined into larger programs. Provides basic CTT analysis,
  a simple common interface to the estimation of item
  parameters in IRT models for binary responses with three different programs
  (ICL, BILOG-MG, and ltm), ability estimation (MLE, BME, EAP, WLE, plausible
  values), item and person fit statistics, scaling methods (MM, MS, Stocking-Lord,
  and the complete Hebaera method), and a rich array of parametric and
  non-parametric (kernel) plots. Estimates and plots Haberman's interaction model
  when all items are dichotomously scored.
