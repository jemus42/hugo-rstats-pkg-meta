title: Omics Data Integration Using Kernel Methods
maintainer: Jerome Mariette
description: |-
  Kernel-based methods are powerful methods for integrating
  heterogeneous types of data. mixKernel aims at providing methods to combine
  kernel for unsupervised exploratory analysis. Different solutions are
  provided to compute a meta-kernel, in a consensus way or in a way that
  best preserves the original topology of the data. mixKernel also integrates
  kernel PCA to visualize similarities between samples in a non linear space
  and from the multiple source point of view. Functions to assess and display
  important variables are also provided in the package. Jerome Mariette and
  Nathalie Villa-Vialaneix (2017) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx682>.
