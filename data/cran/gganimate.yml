title: A Grammar of Animated Graphics
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  The grammar of graphics as implemented in the 'ggplot2' package has
  been successful in providing a powerful API for creating static
  visualisation. In order to extend the API for animated graphics this package
  provides a completely new set of grammar, fully compatible with 'ggplot2'
  for specifying transitions and animations in a flexible and extensible way.
