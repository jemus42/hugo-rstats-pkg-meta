title: Matching Algorithms for Causal Inference with Clustered Data
maintainer: Massimo Cannas
description: Provides functions to perform matching algorithms for causal inference
  with clustered data, as described in B. Arpino and M. Cannas (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.6880>.
  Pure within-cluster and preferential within-cluster matching are implemented. Both
  algorithms provide causal estimates with cluster-adjusted estimates of standard
  errors.
