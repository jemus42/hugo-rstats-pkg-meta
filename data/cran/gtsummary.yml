title: Presentation-Ready Data Summary and Analytic Result Tables
maintainer: Daniel D. Sjoberg
description: |-
  Creates presentation-ready tables summarizing data
  sets, regression models, and more. The code to create the tables is
  concise and highly customizable. Data frames can be summarized with
  any function, e.g. mean(), median(), even user-written functions.
  Regression models are summarized and include the reference rows for
  categorical variables. Common regression models, such as logistic
  regression and Cox proportional hazards regression, are automatically
  identified and the tables are pre-filled with appropriate column
  headers.
