title: Efficiently Generates Random Order Statistic Variables
maintainer: Christian Sims
description: All the methods in this package generate a vector of uniform order statistics
  using a beta distribution and use an inverse cumulative distribution function for
  some distribution to give a vector of random order statistic variables for some
  distribution. This is much more efficient than using a loop since it is directly
  sampling from the order statistic distribution.
