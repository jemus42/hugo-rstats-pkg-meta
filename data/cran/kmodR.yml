title: K-Means with Simultaneous Outlier Detection
maintainer: David Charles Howe
description: 'An implementation of the ''k-means--'' algorithm proposed by Chawla
  and Gionis, 2013 in their paper, "k-means-- : A unified approach to clustering and
  outlier detection. SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM13)", and using
  ''ordering'' described by Howe, 2013 in the thesis, "Clustering and anomaly detection
  in tropical cyclones". Useful for creating (potentially) tighter clusters than standard
  k-means and simultaneously finding outliers inexpensively in multidimensional space.'
