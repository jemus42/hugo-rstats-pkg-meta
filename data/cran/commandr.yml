title: Command pattern in R
maintainer: Tengfei Yin
description: An S4 representation of the Command design pattern. The<U+000a>Operation
  class is a simple implementation using closures and supports<U+000a>forward and
  reverse (undo) evaluation. The more complicated Protocol<U+000a>framework represents
  each type of command (or analytical protocol) by<U+000a>a formal S4 class. Commands
  may be grouped and consecutively executed<U+000a>using the Pipeline class. Example
  use cases include logging, do/undo,<U+000a>analysis pipelines, GUI actions, parallel
  processing, etc.
