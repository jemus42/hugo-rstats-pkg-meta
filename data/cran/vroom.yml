title: Read and Write Rectangular Text Data Quickly
maintainer: Jim Hester
description: |-
  The goal of 'vroom' is to read and write data (like
  'csv', 'tsv' and 'fwf') quickly. When reading it uses a quick initial
  indexing step, then reads the values lazily , so only the data you
  actually use needs to be read.  The writer formats the data in
  parallel and writes to disk asynchronously from formatting.
