title: Statistical Methods for Quality Science
maintainer: Thomas Roth
description: 'Contains methods associated with the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve
  and Control (i.e. DMAIC) cycle of the Six Sigma Quality Management methodology.It
  covers distribution fitting, normal and non-normal process capability indices, techniques
  for Measurement Systems Analysis especially gage capability indices and Gage Repeatability
  (i.e Gage RR) and Reproducibility studies, factorial and fractional factorial designs
  as well as response surface methods including the use of desirability functions.
  Improvement via Six Sigma is project based strategy that covers 5 phases: Define
  - Pareto Chart; Measure - Probability and Quantile-Quantile Plots, Process Capability
  Indices for various distributions and Gage RR Analyze i.e. Pareto Chart, Multi-Vari
  Chart, Dot Plot; Improve - Full and fractional factorial, response surface and mixture
  designs as well as the desirability approach for simultaneous optimization of more
  than one response variable. Normal, Pareto and Lenth Plot of effects as well as
  Interaction Plots; Control - Quality Control Charts can be found in the ''qcc''
  package. The focus is on teaching the statistical methodology used in the Quality
  Sciences.'
