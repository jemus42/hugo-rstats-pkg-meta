title: Stack and Reshape Datasets After Splitting Concatenated Values
maintainer: Ananda Mahto
description: |-
  Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export
  multiple-response questions with data concatenated in cells. The
  concat.split (cSplit) family of functions splits such data into separate
  cells. The package also includes functions to stack groups of columns and
  to reshape wide data, even when the data are "unbalanced"---something
  which reshape (from base R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from
  reshape2 do not easily handle.
