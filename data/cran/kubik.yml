title: Cubic Hermite Splines and Related Optimization Methods
maintainer: Abby Spurdle
description: Constructs, plots and evaluates constrained cubic Hermite splines, which
  can be used to construct monotonic and bounded splines. Computes their first derivatives,
  indefinite integrals and smooth approximations of their first, second and higher
  derivatives. Also, computes their roots/solutions, along with their minima/maxima
  and inflection points.
