title: Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling
maintainer: Andreas Handel
description: |-
  A collection of 'shiny' apps that allow for the simulation and
  exploration of various within-host immune response scenarios.
  The purpose of the package is to help individuals learn
  about within-host infection and immune response modeling from a dynamical systems perspective.
  All apps include explanations of the underlying models and instructions on
  what to do with the models.
  The development of this package was partially supported by NIH grant U19AI117891.
