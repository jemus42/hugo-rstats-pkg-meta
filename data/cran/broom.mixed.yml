title: Tidying Methods for Mixed Models
maintainer: Ben Bolker
description: |-
  Convert fitted objects from various R mixed-model packages
  into tidy data frames along the lines of the 'broom' package.
  The package provides three
  S3 generics for each model: tidy(), which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as
  coefficients of a regression; augment(), which adds columns to the original
  data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance(), which
  provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
