title: Circle Manhattan Plot
maintainer: LiLin-Yin
description: 'Manhattan plot, a type of scatter plot, was widely used to display the
  association results. However, it is usually time-consuming and laborious for a non-specialist
  user to write scripts and adjust parameters of an elaborate plot. Moreover, the
  ever-growing traits measured have necessitated the integration of results from different
  Genome-wide association study researches. Circle Manhattan Plot is the first open
  R package that can lay out. Genome-wide association study P-value results in both
  traditional rectangular patterns, QQ-plot and novel circular ones. United in only
  one bull''s eye style plot, association results from multiple traits can be compared
  interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and differences between signals.
  Additional functions include: highlight signals, a group of SNPs, chromosome visualization
  and candidate genes around SNPs.'
