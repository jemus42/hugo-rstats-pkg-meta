title: Horn's Test of Principal Components/Factors
maintainer: Alexis Dinno
description: An implementation of Horn's technique for numerically and graphically
  evaluating the components or factors retained in a principle components analysis
  (PCA) or common factor analysis (FA). Horn's method contrasts eigenvalues produced
  through a PCA or FA on a number of random data sets of uncorrelated variables with
  the same number of variables and observations as the experimental or observational
  data set to produce eigenvalues for components or factors that are adjusted for
  the sample error-induced inflation. Components with adjusted eigenvalues greater
  than one are retained. paran may also be used to conduct parallel analysis following
  Glorfeld's (1995) suggestions to reduce the likelihood of over-retention.
