description: |-
  The package can identify the dysregulated KEGG pathways
  based on global influence from the internal effect of pathways
  and crosstalk between pathways. (1) The PAGI package can
  prioritize the pathways associated with two biological states
  by statistical significance or FDR. (2) The PAGI package can
  evaluated the global influence factor (GIF) score in the global
  gene-gene network constructed based on the relationships of
  genes extracted from each pathway in KEGG database and the
  overlapped genes between pathways.
