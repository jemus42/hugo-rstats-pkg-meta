maintainer: Matteo Sesia
description: |-
  Model-free knockoffs are a general procedure for controlling the false
  discovery rate (FDR) when performing variable selection. For more information,
  see the website below and the accompanying paper: Candes et al.,
  "Panning for Gold: Model-free Knockoffs for High-dimensional Controlled Variable Selection",
