  Calculates the Minimum Sample Size Required for Developing a
  Multivariable Prediction Model
maintainer: Joie Ensor
description: 'Computes the minimum sample size required for the development of a new
  multivariable prediction model using the criteria proposed by Riley et al. (2018)
  <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992>. pmsampsize can be used to calculate the minimum sample
  size for the development of models with continuous, binary or survival (time-to-event)
  outcomes. Riley et al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992> lay out a series of criteria
  the sample size should meet. These aim to minimise the overfitting and to ensure
  precise estimation of key parameters in the prediction model.'
