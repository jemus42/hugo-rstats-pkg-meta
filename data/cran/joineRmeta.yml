title: Joint Modelling for Meta-Analytic (Multi-Study) Data
maintainer: Maria Sudell
description: |-
  Fits joint models of the type proposed by Henderson and colleagues
  (2000) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465>, but extends to the multi-study,
  meta-analytic case. Functions for meta-analysis of a single longitudinal and
  a single  time-to-event outcome from multiple studies using joint models.
  Options to produce plots for multi study joint data, to pool joint model
  fits from 'JM' and 'joineR' packages in a two stage meta-analysis, and to
  model multi-study joint data in a one stage meta-analysis.
