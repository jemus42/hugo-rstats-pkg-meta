title: Nonparametric Missing Value Imputation using Random Forest
maintainer: Daniel J. Stekhoven
description: The function 'missForest' in this package is used to<U+000a>impute missing
  values particularly in the case of mixed-type<U+000a>data. It uses a random forest
  trained on the observed values of<U+000a>a data matrix to predict the missing values.
  It can be used to<U+000a>impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex<U+000a>interactions
  and non-linear relations. It yields an out-of-bag<U+000a>(OOB) imputation error
  estimate without the need of a test set<U+000a>or elaborate cross-validation. It
  can be run in parallel to<U+000a>save computation time.
