title: Mixture Link Regression
maintainer: Andrew M. Raim
description: The Mixture Link model <arXiv:1612.03302> is a proposed extension to
  generalized linear models, where the outcome distribution is a finite mixture of
  J > 1 densities. This package supports Mixture Link computations for Poisson and
  Binomial outcomes. This includes the distribution functions, numerical maximum likelihood
  estimation, Bayesian analysis, and quantile residuals to assess model fit.
