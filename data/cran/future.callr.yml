title: A Future API for Parallel Processing using 'callr'
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: Implementation of the Future API on top of the 'callr' package.  This
  allows you to process futures, as defined by the 'future' package, in parallel out
  of the box, on your local (Linux, macOS, Windows, ...) machine.  Contrary to backends
  relying on the 'parallel' package (e.g. 'future::multisession'), the 'callr' backend
  provided here can run more than 125 parallel R processes.
