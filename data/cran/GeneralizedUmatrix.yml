title: Credible Visualization for Two-Dimensional Projections of Data
maintainer: Michael Thrun
description: 'Projections are common dimensionality reduction methods, which represent
  high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space. However, when restricting the
  output space to two dimensions, which results in a two dimensional scatter plot
  (projection) of the data, low dimensional similarities do not represent high dimensional
  distances coercively [Thrun, 2018]. This could lead to a misleading interpretation
  of the underlying structures [Thrun, 2018]. By means of the 3D topographic map the
  generalized Umatrix is able to depict errors of these two-dimensional scatter plots.
  The package is based on the book of Thrun, M.C.: "Projection Based Clustering through
  Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.'
