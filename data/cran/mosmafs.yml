version: 0.1.2
title: Multi-Objective Simultaneous Model and Feature Selection
maintainer: Martin Binder
description: |-
  Performs simultaneous hyperparameter tuning and
  feature selection through both single-objective and multi-objective
  optimization as described in Binder, Moosbauer et al. (2019) <arXiv:1912.12912>.
  Uses the 'ecr'-package as basis but adds mixed integer
  evolutionary strategies and multi-fidelity functionality as well as operators
  specific for the problem of feature selection.
