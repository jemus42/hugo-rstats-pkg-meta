title: Outlier Detection Algorithms for High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Cheng Fan
description: Three high-dimensional outlier detection algorithms and a outlier unification
  scheme are implemented in this package. The angle-based outlier detection (ABOD)
  algorithm is based on the work of Kriegel, Schubert, and Zimek [2008]. The subspace
  outlier detection (SOD) algorithm is based on the work of Kriegel, Kroger, Schubert,
  and Zimek [2009]. The feature bagging-based outlier detection (FBOD) algorithm is
  based on the work of Lazarevic and Kumar [2005]. The outlier unification scheme
  is based on the work of Kriegel, Kroger, Schubert, and Zimek [2011].
