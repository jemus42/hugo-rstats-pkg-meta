maintainer: Simone Hermann
description: |-
  Bayesian estimation and prediction for stochastic processes based
  on the Euler approximation. Considered processes are: jump diffusion,
  (mixed) diffusion models, hidden (mixed) diffusion models, non-homogeneous
  Poisson processes (NHPP), (mixed) regression models for comparison and a
  regression model including a NHPP.
