  Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Clustering with Mixed Scale
  Variables
maintainer: Christian Carmona
description: Bayesian nonparametric approach for clustering that is capable to combine
  different types of variables (continuous, ordinal and nominal) and also accommodates
  for different sampling probabilities in a complex survey design. The model is based
  on a location mixture model with a Poisson-Dirichlet process prior on the location
  parameters of the associated latent variables. The package performs the clustering
  model described in Carmona, C., Nieto-Barajas, L. E., Canale, A. (2016) <arXiv:1612.00083>.
