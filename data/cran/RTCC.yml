title: Detecting Trait Clustering in Environmental Gradients
maintainer: Mateu Menendez-Serra
description: |-
  The Randomized Trait Community Clustering method (Triado-Margarit et al., 2019,
  <doi:10.1038/s41396-019-0454-4>) is a statistical approach which allows to determine whether
  if an observed trait clustering pattern is related to an increasing environmental constrain.
  The method 1) determines whether exists or not a trait clustering on the sampled communities
  and 2) assess if the observed clustering signal is related or not to an increasing environmental
  constrain along an environmental gradient. Also, when the effect of the environmental gradient
  is not linear, allows to determine consistent thresholds on the community assembly based on trait-values.
