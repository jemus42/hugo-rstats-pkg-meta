title: Multivariate Analysis and Visualization for Biological Data
maintainer: Samuel V. Scarpino
description: Code to support a systems biology research program from inception through
  publication.  The methods focus on dimension reduction approaches to detect patterns
  in complex, multivariate experimental data and places an emphasis on informative
  visualizations.  The goal for this project is to create a package that will evolve
  over time, thereby remaining relevant and reflective of current methods and techniques.  As
  a result, we encourage suggested additions to the package, both methodological and
  graphical.
