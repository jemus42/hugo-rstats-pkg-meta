description: |-
  Measures niche breadth and overlap of microbial taxa from large matrices.
  Niche breadth measurements include Levins' niche breadth (Bn) index, Hurlbert's Bn
  and Feinsinger's proportional similarity (PS) index. (Feinsinger, P., Spears, E.E.,
  Poole, R.W. (1981) <doi:10.2307/1936664>). Niche overlap measurements include
  Levin's Overlap (Ludwig, J.A. and Reynolds, J.F. (1988, ISBN:0471832359)) and a Jaccard
  similarity index of Feinsinger's PS values between taxa pairs, as Proportional Overlap.
