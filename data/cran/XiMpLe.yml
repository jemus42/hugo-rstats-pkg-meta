title: A Simple XML Tree Parser and Generator
maintainer: Meik Michalke
description: |-
  Provides a simple XML tree parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML files into R objects, get information out of and into nodes, and write R objects back
  to XML code. It's not as powerful as the 'XML' package and doesn't aim to be, but for simple XML handling it could be useful. It was originally developed for
  the R GUI and IDE 'RKWard' <https://rkward.kde.org>, to make plugin development easier.
