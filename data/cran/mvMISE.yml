  A General Framework of Multivariate Mixed-Effects Selection
  Models
maintainer: Jiebiao Wang
description: |-
  Offers a general framework of multivariate mixed-effects
  models for the joint analysis of multiple correlated outcomes with clustered
  data structures and potential missingness proposed by Wang et al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy022>. The missingness of outcome values may
  depend on the values themselves (missing not at random and non-ignorable),
  or may depend on only the covariates (missing at random and ignorable), or both.
  This package provides functions for two models: 1) mvMISE_b()
  allows correlated outcome-specific random intercepts with a factor-analytic
  structure, and 2) mvMISE_e() allows the correlated outcome-specific
  error terms with a graphical lasso penalty on the error precision matrix. Both functions
  are motivated by the multivariate data analysis on data with clustered structures
  from labelling-based quantitative proteomic studies. These models and functions
  can also be applied to univariate and multivariate analyses of clustered data
  with balanced or unbalanced design and no missingness.
