title: R at the Command-Line via 'r'
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  A scripting and command-line front-end
  is provided by 'r' (aka 'littler') as a lightweight binary wrapper around
  the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
  While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
  both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hash-mark-exclamation-path
  expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
  standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without
  the environment.
