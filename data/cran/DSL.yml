title: Distributed Storage and List
maintainer: Stefan Theussl
description: An abstract DList class helps storing large list-type objects in a distributed
  manner. Corresponding high-level functions and methods for handling distributed
  storage (DStorage) and lists allows for processing such DLists on distributed systems
  efficiently. In doing so it uses a well defined storage backend implemented based
  on the DStorage class.
