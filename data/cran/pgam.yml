title: Poisson-Gamma Additive Models
maintainer: Washington Junger
description: This work is an extension of the state space model for Poisson count
  data, Poisson-Gamma model, towards a semiparametric specification. Just like the
  generalized additive models (GAM), cubic splines are used for covariate smoothing.
  The semiparametric models are fitted by an iterative process that combines maximization
  of likelihood and backfitting algorithm.
