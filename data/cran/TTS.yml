  Master Curve Estimates Corresponding to Time-Temperature
  Superposition
maintainer: Antonio Meneses
description: |-
  Time-Temperature Superposition analysis is often applied to frequency modulated data obtained by Dynamic
  Mechanic Analysis (DMA) and Rheometry in the analytical chemistry and physics
  areas. These techniques provide estimates of material mechanical properties
  (such as moduli) at different temperatures in a wider range of time. This
  package provides the Time-Temperature superposition Master Curve at a referred
  temperature by the three methods: the two wider used methods, Arrhenius based
  methods and WLF, and the newer methodology based on derivatives procedure.
  The Master Curve is smoothed by B-splines basis. The package output is composed
  of plots of experimental data, horizontal and vertical shifts, TTS data, and TTS
  data fitted using B-splines with bootstrap confidence intervals.
