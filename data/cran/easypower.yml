title: Sample Size Estimation for Experimental Designs
maintainer: Aaron McGarvey
description: |-
  Power analysis is used in the estimation of sample sizes for
  experimental designs. Most programs and R packages will only output the highest
  recommended sample size to the user. Often the user input can be complicated
  and computing multiple power analyses for different treatment comparisons can
  be time consuming. This package simplifies the user input and allows the user
  to view all of the sample size recommendations or just the ones they want to see.
  The calculations used to calculate the recommended sample sizes are from the
  'pwr' package.
