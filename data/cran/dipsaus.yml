title: A Dipping Sauce for Data Analysis and Visualizations
maintainer: Zhengjia Wang
description: |-
  Works as an "add-on" to packages like 'shiny', 'future', as well as
  'rlang', and provides utility functions. Just like dipping sauce adding
  flavors to potato chips or pita bread, 'dipsaus' for data analysis and
  visualizations adds handy functions and enhancements to popular packages.
  The goal is to provide simple solutions that are frequently asked for
  online, such as how to synchronize 'shiny' inputs without freezing the app,
  or how to get memory size on 'Linux' or 'MacOS' system. The enhancements
  roughly fall into these four categories: 1. 'shiny' input widgets; 2.
  high-performance computing using 'RcppParallel' and 'future' package; 3.
  modify R calls and convert among numbers, strings, and other objects. 4.
  utility functions to get system information such like CPU chip-set, memory
  limit, etc.
