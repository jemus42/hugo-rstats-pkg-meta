  Assessment of Data Trial Distributions According to the
  Carlisle-Stouffer Method
maintainer: Bernardo Sousa-Pinto
description: |-
  Assessment of the distributions of baseline continuous and categorical
  variables in randomised trials. This method is based on the Carlisle-Stouffer
  method with Monte Carlo simulations. It calculates p-values for each trial
  baseline variable, as well as combined p-values for each trial - these p-values
  measure how compatible are distributions of trials baseline variables with
  random sampling. This package also allows for graphically plotting the
  cumulative frequencies of computed p-values.
  Please note that code was partly adapted from Carlisle JB, Loadsman JA.
