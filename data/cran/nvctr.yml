  The n-vector Approach to Geographical Position Calculations
  using an Ellipsoidal Model of Earth
maintainer: Enrico Spinielli
description: |-
  The n-vector framework uses the normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid
  (called n-vector) as a non-singular position representation that turns out to
  be very convenient for practical position calculations.
  The n-vector is simple to use and gives exact answers for all global positions,
  and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models.
  This package is a translation of the 'Matlab' library from FFI,
  the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, as described in Gade (2010)
  <doi:10.1017/S0373463309990415>.
