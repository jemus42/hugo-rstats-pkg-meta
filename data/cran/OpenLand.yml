maintainer: Reginal Exavier
description: |-
  Tools for the analysis of land use and cover (LUC) time series. It
  includes support for loading spatiotemporal raster data and synthesized
  spatial plotting. Several LUC change (LUCC) metrics in regular or irregular
  time intervals can be extracted and visualized through one- and multistep
  sankey and chord diagrams. A complete intensity analysis according to
  Aldwaik and Pontius (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.02.010> is
  implemented, including tools for the generation of standardized multilevel
  output graphics.
