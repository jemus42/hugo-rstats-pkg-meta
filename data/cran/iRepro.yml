title: Reproducibility for Interval-Censored Data
maintainer: Jelena Kovacic
description: Calculates intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessing reproducibility
  of interval-censored data with two repeated measurements (Kovacic and Varnai (2014)
  <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000139>). ICC is estimated by maximum likelihood from
  model with one fixed and one random effect (both intercepts). Help in model checking
  (normality of subjects' means and residuals) is provided.
