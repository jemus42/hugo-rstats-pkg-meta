title: Stabilized Nearest Neighbor Classifier
maintainer: Wei Sun
description: Implement K-nearest neighbor classifier, weighted nearest neighbor classifier,
  bagged nearest neighbor classifier, optimal weighted nearest neighbor classifier
  and stabilized nearest neighbor classifier, and perform model selection via 5 fold
  cross-validation for them. This package also provides functions for computing the
