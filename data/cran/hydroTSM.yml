  Time Series Management, Analysis and Interpolation for
  Hydrological Modelling
maintainer: Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini
description: S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and plotting of
  time series used in hydrology and related environmental sciences. In particular,
  this package is highly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. The focus of this
  package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful for the daily work
  of hydrologists (although an effort was made to optimise each function as much as
  possible, functionality has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions
  / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular, datasets that
  can be included in this package for academic purposes.
