title: Focused Information Criteria for Model Comparison
maintainer: Christopher Jackson
description: Compares how well different models estimate a quantity of interest (the
  "focus") so that different models may be preferred for different purposes.  Comparisons
  within any class of models fitted by maximum likelihood are supported, with shortcuts
  for commonly-used classes such as generalised linear models and parametric survival
  models.  The methods originate from Claeskens and Hjort (2003) <doi:10.1198/016214503000000819>
  and Claeskens and Hjort (2008, ISBN:9780521852258).
