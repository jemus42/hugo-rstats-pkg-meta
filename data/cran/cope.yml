title: Coverage Probability Excursion (CoPE) Sets
maintainer: Max Sommerfeld
description: |-
  Provides functions to  compute and plot Coverage
  Probability Excursion (CoPE) sets
  for real valued functions on a 2-dimensional domain. CoPE sets are obtained
  from repeated noisy observations of the function on the entire domain.
  They are designed to bound the excursion
  set of the target function at a given level from above and below with
  a predefined probability. The target
  function can be a parameter in spatially-indexed linear regression.
  Support by NIH grant R01 CA157528 is gratefully acknowledged.
