title: Simple Dengue Test and Vaccinate Cost Thresholds
maintainer: Carl A. B. Pearson
description: |-
  Provides the mathematical model described by "Serostatus Testing & Dengue Vaccine Cost-Benefit Thresholds"
  in <doi:10.1098/rsif.2019.0234>.  Using the functions in the package,
  that analysis can be repeated using sample life histories, either synthesized from local seroprevalence data
  using other functions in this package (as in the manuscript) or from some other source.
  The package provides a vignette which walks through the analysis in the publication, as well as a function
  to generate a project skeleton for such an analysis.
