description: |-
  Modular implementation of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms
  based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) [Zhang and Li (2007),
  <DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2007.892759>] for quick assembling and
  testing of new algorithmic components, as well as easy
  replication of published MOEA/D proposals. The full framework is
  documented in a paper published in the Journal of Statistical
  Software [<doi:10.18637/jss.v092.i06>].
