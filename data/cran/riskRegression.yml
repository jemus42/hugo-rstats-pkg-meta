  Risk Regression Models and Prediction Scores for Survival
  Analysis with Competing Risks
maintainer: Thomas Alexander Gerds
description: |-
  Implementation of the following methods for event history analysis.
  Risk regression models for survival endpoints also in the presence of competing
  risks are fitted using binomial regression based on a time sequence of binary
  event status variables. A formula interface for the Fine-Gray regression model
  and an interface for the combination of cause-specific Cox regression models.
  A toolbox for assessing and comparing performance of risk predictions (risk
  markers and risk prediction models). Prediction performance is measured by the
  Brier score and the area under the ROC curve for binary possibly time-dependent
  outcome. Inverse probability of censoring weighting and pseudo values are used
  to deal with right censored data. Lists of risk markers and lists of risk models
  are assessed simultaneously. Cross-validation repeatedly splits the data, trains
  the risk prediction models on one part of each split and then summarizes and
  compares the performance across splits.
