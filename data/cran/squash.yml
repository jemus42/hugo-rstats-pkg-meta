title: Color-Based Plots for Multivariate Visualization
maintainer: Aron C. Eklund
description: Functions for color-based visualization of multivariate data, i.e. colorgrams
  or heatmaps.  Lower-level functions  map numeric values to colors, display a matrix
  as an array of colors, and draw color keys.  Higher-level plotting functions generate
  a bivariate histogram, a dendrogram aligned with a color-coded matrix, a triangular
  distance matrix, and more.
