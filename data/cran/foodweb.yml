title: visualisation and analysis of food web networks
maintainer: Giselle Perdomo
description: |-
  Calculates twelve commonly-used, basic measures of food
  web network structure from binary, predator-prey matrices:
  species richness, connectance, total number of links, link
  density, number of trophic positions, predator:prey ratio, and
  fraction of carnivores, herbivores, top species and
  intermediate species.  Employs food web language in the code
  and output, translates between a couple of common food web
  formats, can handle food webs consisting of multiple levels,
  and can automate the analysis for a large number of webs. The
  program produces 3-dimensional graphs of high quality that can
  be customized by the user.
