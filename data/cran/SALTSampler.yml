title: Efficient Sampling on the Simplex
maintainer: Scott Vander Wiel
description: |-
  The SALTSampler package facilitates Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
  sampling of random variables on a simplex. A Self-Adjusting Logit Transform
  (SALT) proposal is used so that sampling is still efficient even in difficult
  cases, such as those in high dimensions or with parameters that differ by orders
  of magnitude. Special care is also taken to maintain accuracy even when some
  coordinates approach 0 or 1 numerically. Diagnostic and graphic functions are
  included in the package, enabling easy assessment of the convergence and mixing
  of the chain within the constrained space.
