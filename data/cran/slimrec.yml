description: |-
  Sparse Linear Method(SLIM) predicts ratings and top-n
  recommendations suited for sparse implicit positive feedback systems. SLIM
  is decomposed into multiple elasticnet optimization problems which are solved
  in parallel over multiple cores. The package is based on "SLIM: Sparse Linear
  Methods for Top-N Recommender Systems" by Xia Ning and George Karypis <doi:10.1109/ICDM.2011.134>.
