title: Pseudo-Realizations for Gaussian Process Excursions
maintainer: Dario Azzimonti
description: Computes pseudo-realizations from the posterior distribution of a Gaussian
  Process (GP) with the method described in Azzimonti et al. (2016) <doi:10.1137/141000749>.
  The realizations are obtained from simulations of the field at few well chosen points
  that minimize the expected distance in measure between the true excursion set of
  the field and the approximate one. Also implements a R interface for (the main function
  of) Distance Transform of sampled Functions (<http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/dt/index.html>).
