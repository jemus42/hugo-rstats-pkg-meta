title: Group Sequential Refined Secondary Boundary
maintainer: Jiangtao Gou
description: A gate-keeping procedure to test a primary and a secondary endpoint in
  a group sequential design with multiple interim looks. Computations related to group
  sequential primary and secondary boundaries. Refined secondary boundaries are calculated
  for a gate-keeping test on a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential
  design with multiple interim looks. The choices include both the standard boundaries
  and the boundaries using error spending functions. Version 1.0.0 was released on
  April 12, 2017. See Tamhane et al. (2018), "A gatekeeping procedure to test a primary
  and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks",
  Biometrics, 74(1), 40-48.
