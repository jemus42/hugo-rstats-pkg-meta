description: |-
  Classes and methods for modelling and simulation of
  periodically correlated (PC) and periodically integrated time
  series.  Compute theoretical periodic autocovariances and related
  properties of PC autoregressive moving average models. Some original
  methods including Boshnakov & Iqelan (2009)
