  Implementation of a Generic Adaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain
  Sampler
maintainer: Andreas Scheidegger
description: Enables sampling from arbitrary distributions if the log density is known
  up to a constant; a common situation in the context of Bayesian inference. The implemented
  sampling algorithm was proposed by Vihola (2012) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-011-9269-5>
  and achieves often a high efficiency by tuning the proposal distributions to a user
  defined acceptance rate.
