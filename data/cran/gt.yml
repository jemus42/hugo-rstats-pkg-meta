title: Easily Create Presentation-Ready Display Tables
maintainer: Richard Iannone
description: |-
  Build display tables from tabular data with an easy-to-use set of
  functions. With its progressive approach, we can construct display tables
  with a cohesive set of table parts. Table values can be formatted using any
  of the included formatting functions. Footnotes and cell styles can be
  precisely added through a location targeting system. The way in which 'gt'
  handles things for you means that you don't often have to worry about the
  fine details.
