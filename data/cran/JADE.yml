  Blind Source Separation Methods Based on Joint Diagonalization
  and Some BSS Performance Criteria
maintainer: Klaus Nordhausen
description: Cardoso's JADE algorithm as well as his functions for joint diagonalization
  are ported to R. Also several other blind source separation (BSS) methods, like
  AMUSE and SOBI, and some criteria for performance evaluation of BSS algorithms,
  are given. The package is described in Miettinen, Nordhausen and Taskinen (2017)
