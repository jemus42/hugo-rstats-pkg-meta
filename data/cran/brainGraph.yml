title: Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data
maintainer: Christopher G. Watson
description: |-
  A set of tools for performing graph theory analysis of brain MRI
  data. It works with data from a Freesurfer analysis (cortical thickness,
  volumes, local gyrification index, surface area), diffusion tensor
  tractography data (e.g., from FSL) and resting-state fMRI data (e.g., from
  DPABI). It contains a graphical user interface for graph visualization and
  data exploration, along with several functions for generating useful
  figures.
