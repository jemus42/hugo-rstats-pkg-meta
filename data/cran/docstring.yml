title: Provides Docstring Capabilities to R Functions
maintainer: Dason Kurkiewicz
description: |-
  Provides the ability to display something analogous to
  Python's docstrings within R.  By allowing the user to document
  their functions as comments at the beginning of their function
  without requiring putting the function into a package we allow
  more users to easily provide documentation for their functions.
  The documentation can be viewed just like any other help files
  for functions provided by packages as well.
