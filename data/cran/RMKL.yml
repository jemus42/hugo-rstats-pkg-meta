  Multiple Kernel Learning for Classification or Regression
  Problems
maintainer: Christopher Wilson
description: |-
  Provides R and C++ function that enable the user to conduct multiple
  kernel learning (MKL) and cross validation for support vector machine (SVM) models.
  Cross validation can be used to identify kernel shapes and hyperparameter
  combinations that can be used as candidate kernels for MKL. There are three
  implementations provided in this package, namely SimpleMKL Alain Rakotomamonjy et. al
  (2008), Simple and Efficient MKL Xu et. al (2010), and Dual augmented Lagrangian MKL
  Suzuki and Tomioka (2011) <doi:10.1007/s10994-011-5252-9>. These methods identify the convex combination of
  candidate kernels to construct an optimal hyperplane.
