title: '''Rcpp'' Integration of Additional Probability Distributions'
maintainer: JB Duck-Mayr
description: |-
  The 'Rcpp' package provides a C++ library to make it easier
  to use C++ with R. R and 'Rcpp' provide functions for a variety of
  statistical distributions. Several R packages make functions
  available to R for additional statistical distributions. However,
  to access these functions from C++ code, a costly call to the R
  functions must be made. 'RcppDist' provides a header-only C++ library
  with functions for additional statistical distributions that can be
  called from C++ when writing code using 'Rcpp' or 'RcppArmadillo'.
  Functions are available that return a 'NumericVector' as well as
  doubles, and for multivariate or matrix distributions, 'Armadillo'
  vectors and matrices. 'RcppDist' provides functions for the following
  distributions: the four parameter beta distribution; the location-
  scale t distribution; the truncated normal distribution; the
  truncated t distribution; a truncated location-scale t distribution;
  the triangle distribution; the multivariate normal distribution*;
  the multivariate t distribution*; the Wishart distribution*; and
  the inverse Wishart distribution*. Distributions marked with an
  asterisk rely on 'RcppArmadillo'.
