title: Random Perturbation of Count Matrices
maintainer: KM Gates
description: |-
  The perturbR() function incrementally perturbs network edges (using the   rewireR function)and compares the resulting community detection solutions
  from the rewired networks with the solution found for the original network.
  These comparisons aid in understanding the stability of the
  original solution. The package requires symmetric, weighted (specifically, count) matrices/networks.
