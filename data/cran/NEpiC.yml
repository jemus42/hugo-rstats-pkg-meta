description: 'Package for a Network assisted algorithm for Epigenetic studies using
  mean and variance Combined signals: NEpiC. NEpiC combines both signals in mean and
  variance differences in methylation level between case and control groups searching
  for differentially methylated sub-networks (modules) using the protein-protein interaction
  network.'
