title: A Toolbox for Manipulating and Assessing Colors and Palettes
maintainer: Achim Zeileis
description: |-
  Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces including RGB, HSV, HLS,
  CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB and polar CIELAB.
  Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL colors
  are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales.
  Color palette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk
  or a shiny GUI) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a
  color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying
  and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the
  HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation
  functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and
  simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly).
