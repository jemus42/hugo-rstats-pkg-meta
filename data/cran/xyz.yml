  The 'xyz' Algorithm for Fast Interaction Search in
  High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Gian-Andrea Thanei
description: |-
  High dimensional interaction search by brute force requires a
  quadratic computational cost in the number of variables. The xyz algorithm provably finds strong interactions in almost linear time.
  For details of the algorithm see: G. Thanei, N. Meinshausen and R. Shah (2016). The xyz algorithm for fast interaction search in high-dimensional data <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05108v1.pdf>.
