  Multiple Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional GARCH
  Processes
maintainer: Karolos Korkas
description: Implements a segmentation algorithm for multiple change-point detection
  in high-dimensional GARCH processes. It simultaneously segments GARCH processes
  by identifying 'common' change-points, each of which can be shared by a subset or
  all of the component time series as a change-point in their within-series and/or
  cross-sectional correlation structure.
