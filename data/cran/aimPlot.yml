title: Create Pie Like Plot for Completeness
maintainer: Yusman Kamaleri
description: |-
  Create a pie like plot to visualise if the aim or several aims of a
  project is achieved or close to be achieved i.e the aim is achieved when the point is at the
  center of the pie plot. Imagine it's like a dartboard and the center means 100%
  completeness/achievement. Achievement can also be understood as 100%
  coverage. The standard distribution of completeness allocated in the pie plot
  is 50%, 80% and 100% completeness.
