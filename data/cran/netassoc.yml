title: Inference of Species Associations from Co-Occurrence Data
maintainer: Benjamin Blonder
description: Infers species associations from community matrices. Uses local and (optional)
  regional-scale co-occurrence data by comparing observed partial correlation coefficients
  between species to those estimated from regional species distributions. Extends
  Gaussian graphical models to a null modeling framework. Provides interface to a
  variety of inverse covariance matrix estimation methods.
