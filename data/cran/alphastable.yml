title: Inference for Stable Distribution
maintainer: Mahdi Teimouri
description: |-
  Developed to perform the tasks given by the following. 1-computing the probability density function and distribution function of a univariate stable distribution; 2- generating from univariate stable, truncated stable, multivariate elliptically contoured stable, and bivariate strictly stable distributions; 3- estimating the parameters of univariate symmetric stable, skew stable, Cauchy, multivariate elliptically contoured stable, and multivariate strictly stable distributions; 4- estimating
  the parameters of the mixture of symmetric stable and mixture of Cauchy distributions.
