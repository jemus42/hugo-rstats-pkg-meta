  Non-Negative Lasso and Elastic Net Penalized Generalized Linear
  Models
maintainer: Baidya Nath Mandal
description: Estimates of coefficients of lasso penalized linear regression and generalized
  linear models subject to non-negativity constraints on the parameters using multiplicative
  iterative algorithm. Entire regularization path for a sequence of lambda values
  can be obtained. Functions are available for creating plots of regularization path,
  cross validation and estimating coefficients at a given lambda value. There is also
  provision for obtaining standard error of coefficient estimates.
