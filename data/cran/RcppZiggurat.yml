  'Rcpp' Integration of Different "Ziggurat" Normal RNG
  Implementations
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  The Ziggurat generator for normally distributed random
  numbers, originally proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000,
  <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>) has been improved upon a few times
  starting with Leong et al (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>).
  This package provides an aggregation in order to compare different
  implementations in order to provide an 'faster but good enough'
  alternative for use with R and C++ code.
