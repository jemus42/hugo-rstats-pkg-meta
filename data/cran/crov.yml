  Constrained Regression Model for an Ordinal Response and Ordinal
  Predictors

description: Fits a constrained regression model for an ordinal response with ordinal
  predictors and possibly others, Espinosa and Hennig (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9842-2>.
  The parameter estimates associated with an ordinal predictor are constrained to
  be monotonic. If a monotonicity direction (isotonic or antitonic) is not specified
  for an ordinal predictor by the user, then the monotonicity direction classification
  procedure establishes it. Two monotonicity tests are also available to test the
  null hypothesis of monotonicity over a set of parameters associated with an ordinal
  predictor.
