title: Cross-Validation for the SVD (Bi-Cross-Validation)
maintainer: Patrick O. Perry
description: |2-

  Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD approximation via cross
  validation.  The package provides both Gabriel-style "block"
  holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  It also includes an
  implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.  For more information about
  Bi-cross-validation, see Owen & Perry's 2009 AoAS article
  (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2062) and Perry's 2009 PhD thesis
  (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3052).
