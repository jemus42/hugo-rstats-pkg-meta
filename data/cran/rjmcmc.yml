title: Reversible-Jump MCMC Using Post-Processing
maintainer: Nick Gelling
description: |-
  Performs reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (Green, 1995)
  <doi:10.2307/2337340>, specifically the restriction introduced by
  Barker & Link (2013) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2013.791644>. By utilising
  a 'universal parameter' space, RJMCMC is treated as a Gibbs sampling
  problem. Previously-calculated posterior distributions are used to
  quickly estimate posterior model probabilities. Jacobian matrices are
  found using automatic differentiation. For a detailed description of
  the package, see Gelling, Schofield & Barker (2019)
