title: Multinomial Logit Models with Random Parameters
maintainer: Mauricio Sarrias
description: |-
  An implementation of maximum simulated likelihood method for the
  estimation of multinomial logit models with random coefficients.
  Specifically, it allows estimating models with continuous heterogeneity
  such as the mixed multinomial logit and the generalized multinomial logit.
  It also allows estimating models with discrete heterogeneity such as the
  latent class and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit model.
