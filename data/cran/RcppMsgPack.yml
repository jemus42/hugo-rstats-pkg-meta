title: '''MsgPack'' C++ Header Files and Interface Functions for R'
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  'MsgPack' header files are provided for use by R packages, along
  with the ability to access, create and alter 'MsgPack' objects directly from R.
  'MsgPack' is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange
  data among multiple languages like 'JSON' but it is faster and smaller.
  Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings
  require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves. This
  package provides headers from the 'msgpack-c' implementation for C and
  C++(11) for use by R, particularly 'Rcpp'. The included 'msgpack-c' headers
  are licensed under the Boost Software License (Version 1.0); the code added
  by this package as well the R integration are licensed under the GPL (>= 2).
  See the files 'COPYRIGHTS' and 'AUTHORS' for a full list of  copyright holders
  and contributors to 'msgpack-c'.
