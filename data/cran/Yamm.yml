description: |-
  Functionality to compute the projection median via several
  algorithms. This package also provides functions to plot different
  multivariate medians and multivariate quantiles in two-dimensional and
  three-dimensional data respectively. See Chen, F. and Nason, G.P. (2020)
  "A new method for computing the projection median, its influence curve
  and techniques for the production of projected quantile plots." PLOS One
  (accepted for publication).
