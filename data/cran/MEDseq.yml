title: Mixtures of Exponential-Distance Models with Covariates
maintainer: Keefe Murphy
description: Implements a model-based clustering method for categorical life-course
  sequences relying on mixtures of exponential-distance models introduced by Murphy
  et al. (2019) <arXiv:1908.07963>. A range of flexible precision parameter settings
  corresponding to weighted generalisations of the Hamming distance metric are considered,
  along with the potential inclusion of a noise component. Gating covariates can be
  supplied in order to relate sequences to baseline characteristics. Sampling weights
  are also accommodated. The models are fitted using the EM algorithm and tools for
  visualising the results are also provided.
