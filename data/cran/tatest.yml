title: Two-Group Ta-Test
maintainer: Yuan-De Tan
description: The ta-test is a modified two-sample or two-group t-test of Gosset (1908).
  In small samples with less than 15 replicates,the ta-test significantly reduces
  type I error rate but has almost the same power with the t-test and hence can greatly
  enhance reliability or reproducibility of discoveries in biology and medicine. The
  ta-test can test single null hypothesis or multiple null hypotheses without needing
  to correct p-values.
