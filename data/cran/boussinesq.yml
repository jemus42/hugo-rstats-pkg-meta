title: Analytic Solutions for (ground-water) Boussinesq Equation
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: This package is a collection of R functions implemented<U+000a>from published
  and available analytic solutions for the<U+000a>One-Dimensional Boussinesq Equation
  (ground-water). In<U+000a>particular, the function "beq.lin" is the analytic solution
  of<U+000a>the linearized form of Boussinesq Equation between two<U+000a>different
  head-based boundary (Dirichlet) conditions;<U+000a>"beq.song" is the non-linear
  power-series analytic solution of<U+000a>the motion of a wetting front over a dry
  bedrock (Song at al,<U+000a>2007, see complete reference on function documentation).<U+000a>Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration
  of any kind are warmly<U+000a>welcomed.
