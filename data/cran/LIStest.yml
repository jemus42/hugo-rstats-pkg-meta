  Tests of independence based on the Longest Increasing
  Subsequence
maintainer: J. E. Garcia
description: Tests for independence between X and Y computed from a paired sample
  (x1,y1),...(xn,yn) of (X,Y), using one of the following statistics (a) the Longest
  Increasing Subsequence (Ln), (b) JLn, a Jackknife version of Ln or (c) JLMn, a Jackknife
  version of the longest monotonic subsequence. This family of tests can be applied
  under the assumption of continuity of X and Y.
