title: Nonparametric Smoothing of the Hazard Function
maintainer: Paola Rebora
description: |-
  The function estimates the hazard function non parametrically
  from a survival object (possibly adjusted for covariates).
  The smoothed estimate is based on B-splines from the perspective
  of generalized linear mixed models. Left truncated
  and right censoring data are allowed.
