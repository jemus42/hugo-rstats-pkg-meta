title: A Time Series Toolbox for Official Statistics
maintainer: Matthias Bannert
description: 'Plot official statistics'' time series conveniently: automatic legends,
  highlight windows, stacked bar chars with positive and negative contributions, sum-as-line
  option, two y-axes with automatic horizontal grids that fit both axes and other
  popular chart types. ''tstools'' comes with a plethora of defaults to let you plot
  without setting an abundance of parameters first, but gives you the flexibility
  to tweak the defaults. In addition to charts, ''tstools'' provides a super fast,
  ''data.table'' backed time series I/O that allows the user to export / import long
  format, wide format and transposed wide format data to various file types.'
