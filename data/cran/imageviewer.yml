title: Simple 'htmlwidgets' Image Viewer with WebGL Brightness/Contrast
maintainer: Iakov Pustilnik
description: Display a 2D-matrix data as a interactive zoomable gray-scale image viewer,
  providing tools for manual data inspection. The viewer window shows cursor guiding
  lines and a corresponding data slices for both axes at the current cursor position.
  A tool-bar allows adjusting image display brightness/contrast through WebGL filters
  and performing basic high-pass/low-pass filtering.
