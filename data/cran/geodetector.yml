description: 'Spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH), referring to the within strata
  are more similar than the between strata, a model with global parameters would be
  confounded if input data is SSH. Note that the "spatial" here can be either geospatial
  or the space in mathematical meaning. Geographical detector is a novel tool to investigate
  SSH: (1) measure and find SSH of a variable Y; (2) test the power of determinant
  X of a dependent variable Y according to the consistency between their spatial distributions;
  and (3) investigate the interaction between two explanatory variables X1 and X2
  to a dependent variable Y (Wang et al 2014 <doi:10.1080/13658810802443457>, Wang,
  Zhang, and Fu 2016 <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052>).'
