  Co-Operation: Fast Covariance, Correlation, and Cosine
  Similarity Operations
maintainer: Drew Schmidt
description: |-
  Fast implementations of the co-operations: covariance,
  correlation, and cosine similarity.  The implementations are
  fast and memory-efficient and their use is resolved
  automatically based on the input data, handled by R's S3
  methods.  Full descriptions of the algorithms and benchmarks
  are available in the package vignettes.
