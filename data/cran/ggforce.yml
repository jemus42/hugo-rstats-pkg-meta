title: Accelerating 'ggplot2'
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  The aim of 'ggplot2' is to aid in visual data investigations. This
  focus has led to a lack of facilities for composing specialised plots.
  'ggforce' aims to be a collection of mainly new stats and geoms that fills
  this gap. All additional functionality is aimed to come through the official
  extension system so using 'ggforce' should be a stable experience.
