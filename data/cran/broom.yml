title: Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Tibbles
maintainer: Alex Hayes
description: |-
  Summarizes key information about statistical
  objects in tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create
  plots and consistently work with large numbers of models at once.
  Broom provides three verbs that each provide different types of
  information about a model. tidy() summarizes information about model
  components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports
  information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures
  like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual
  observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence
  measures.
