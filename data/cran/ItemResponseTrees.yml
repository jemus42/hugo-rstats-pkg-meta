title: IR-Tree Modeling in 'mirt', 'Mplus', or 'TAM'
maintainer: Hansjörg Plieninger
description: |-
  Item response tree (IR-tree) models are a class of item response
  theory (IRT) models that assume that the responses to polytomous items can
  best be explained by multiple psychological processes; see Böckenholt
  (2012) <doi:10.1037/a0028111> for details. The package
  'ItemResponseTrees' allows to fit such IR-tree models in 'mirt', 'Mplus', or
  'TAM'. The package automates some of the hassle of IR-tree modeling by means
  of a consistent syntax. This allows new users to quickly adopt this model
  class, and this allows experienced users to fit many complex models
  effortlessly.
