title: Tidy Data and 'Geoms' for Bayesian Models
maintainer: Matthew Kay
description: |-
  Compose data for and extract, manipulate, and visualize posterior draws from Bayesian models
  ('JAGS', 'Stan', 'rstanarm', 'brms', 'MCMCglmm', 'coda', ...) in a tidy data format. Functions are provided
  to help extract tidy data frames of draws from Bayesian models and that generate point
  summaries and intervals in a tidy format. In addition, 'ggplot2' 'geoms' and 'stats' are provided for
  common visualization primitives like points with multiple uncertainty intervals, eye plots (intervals plus
  densities), and fit curves with multiple, arbitrary uncertainty bands.
