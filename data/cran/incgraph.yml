title: Incremental Graphlet Counting for Network Optimisation
maintainer: Robrecht Cannoodt
description: |-
  An efficient and incremental approach for calculating
  the differences in orbit counts when performing single edge modifications
  in a network. Calculating the differences in orbit counts is much more efficient than
  recalculating all orbit counts from scratch for each time point.
