title: Wait for a Key Press in a Terminal
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  Wait for a single key press at the 'R' prompt.
  This works in terminals, but does not currently work
  in the 'Windows' 'GUI', the 'OS X' 'GUI' ('R.app'),
  in 'Emacs' 'ESS', in an 'Emacs' shell buffer or in
  'R Studio'. In these cases 'keypress' stops with an
  error message.
