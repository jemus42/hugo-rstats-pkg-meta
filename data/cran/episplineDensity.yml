title: Density Estimation with Soft Information by Exponential<U+000a>Epi-splines
maintainer: Sam Buttrey
description: Produce one-dimensional density estimates using<U+000a>exponential epi-splines.
  The user may incorporate soft information, by<U+000a>imposing constraints that (i)
  require unimodality; (ii) require that the<U+000a>density be monotone non-increase
  or non-decreasing; (iii) put upper bounds<U+000a>on first or second moments; (iv)
  bound the density's values at mesh points;<U+000a>(v) require that the estimate
  be continuous or continuously differentiable;<U+000a>and more.
