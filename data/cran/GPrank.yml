title: Gaussian Process Ranking of Multiple Time Series
maintainer: Hande Topa
description: |-
  Implements a Gaussian process (GP)-based ranking method
  which can be used to rank multiple time series according to their
  temporal activity levels. An example is the case when expression
  levels of all genes are measured over a time course and the main
  concern is to identify the most active genes, i.e. genes which
  show significant non-random variation in their expression levels.
  This is achieved by computing Bayes factors for each time series
  by comparing the marginal likelihoods under time-dependent and
  time-independent GP models. Additional variance information from
  pre-processing of the observations is incorporated into the GP
  models, which makes the ranking more robust against model
  overfitting. The package supports exporting the results to
  'tigreBrowser' for visualisation, filtering or ranking.
