title: Combine Partial Covariance / Relationship Matrices
maintainer: Deniz Akdemir
description: |-
  Combine partial covariance matrices using a Wishart-EM algorithm.
  Methods are described in the November 2019 article by Akdemir et al.
  <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857425v1>.
  It can be used to combine partially overlapping covariance matrices
  from independent trials, partially overlapping multi-view relationship
  data from genomic experiments, partially overlapping Gaussian graphs
  described by their covariance structures.
  High dimensional covariance estimation,
  multi-view data integration.
  high dimensional covariance graph estimation.
