description: |-
  Actuarial reports are prepared for the last day of a specific
  period, such as a month, a quarter or a year. Actuarial models assume that
  certain events happen at the beginning or end of periods. The package
  contains functions to easily refer to the first or last (working) day
  within a specific period relative to a base date to facilitate actuarial
  reporting and to compare results.
