title: Global Envelopes
maintainer: Mari Myllymäki
description: 'Implementation of global envelopes for a set of general d-dimensional
  vectors T in various applications. A 100(1-alpha)% global envelope is a band bounded
  by two vectors such that the probability that T falls outside this envelope in any
  of the d points is equal to alpha. Global means that the probability is controlled
  simultaneously for all the d elements of the vectors. The global envelopes can be
  used for graphical Monte Carlo and permutation tests where the test statistic is
  a multivariate vector or function (e.g. goodness-of-fit testing for point patterns
  and random sets, functional analysis of variance, functional general linear model,
  n-sample test of correspondence of distribution functions), for central regions
  of functional or multivariate data (e.g. outlier detection, functional boxplot)
  and for global confidence and prediction bands (e.g. confidence band in polynomial
  regression, Bayesian posterior prediction). See Myllymäki and Mrkvička (2019) <arXiv:1911.06583>,
