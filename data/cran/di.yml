description: |-
  A set of utilities for calculating the Deficit (frailty) Index (DI) in gerontological studies.
  The deficit index was first proposed by Arnold Mitnitski and Kenneth Rockwood
  and represents a proxy measure of aging and also can be served as
  a sensitive predictor of survival. For more information, see
