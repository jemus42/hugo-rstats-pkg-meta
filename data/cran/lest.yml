  Vectorised Nested if-else Statements Similar to CASE WHEN in
  'SQL'
maintainer: Stefan Fleck
description: |-
  Functions for vectorised conditional recoding of
  variables. case_when() enables you to vectorise multiple if and else
  statements (like 'CASE WHEN' in 'SQL'). if_else() is a stricter and
  more predictable version of ifelse() in 'base' that preserves
  attributes. These functions are forked from 'dplyr' with all package
  dependencies removed and behave identically to the originals.
