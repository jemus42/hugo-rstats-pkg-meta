title: Persist Attributes Across Data Operations
maintainer: Christopher Brown
description: |-
  In base R, object attributes are lost when objects are modified by
  common data operations such as subset, filter, slice, append, extract
  etc. This packages allows objects to be marked as 'sticky' and have
  attributes persisted during these operations or when inserted
  into or extracted from list-like or table-like objects.
