title: Index Construction for Time Series Data
maintainer: Simon Trimborn
description: Derivation of indexes for benchmarking purposes. A methodology with flexible
  number of constituents is implemented. Also functions for market capitalization
  and volume weighted indexes with fixed number of constituents are available. The
  main function of the package, indexComp(), provides the derived index, suitable
  for analysis purposes. The functions indexUpdate(), indexMemberSelection() and indexMembersUpdate()
  are components of indexComp() and enable one to construct and continuously update
  an index, e.g. for display on a website. The methodology behind the functions provided
  gets introduced in Trimborn and Haerdle (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jempfin.2018.08.004>.
