title: Simulation-Based Inference Methods for Infectious Disease Models
maintainer: Trevelyan J. McKinley
description: |-
  Provides some code to run simulations of state-space models, and then
  use these in the Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC)
  algorithm of Toni et al. (2009) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2008.0172> and a bootstrap particle
  filter based particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithm
  (Andrieu et al., 2010 <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00736.x>).
  Also provides functions to plot and summarise the outputs.
