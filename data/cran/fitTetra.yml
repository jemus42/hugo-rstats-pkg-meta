title: fitTetra is an R package for assigning tetraploid genotype<U+000a>scores
maintainer: Gerrit Gort
description: Package fitTetra contains three functions that can be used<U+000a>to
  assign genotypes to a collection of tetraploid samples based<U+000a>on bialleleic
  marker assays. Functions fitTetra (to fit several<U+000a>models for one marker from
  the data and select the best<U+000a>fitting) or saveMarkerModels (calls fitTetra
  for multiple<U+000a>markers and saves the results to files) will probably be the<U+000a>most
  convenient to use. Function CodomMarker offers more<U+000a>control and fits one
  specified model for a given marker.
