title: Fitting log-Linear Models in Sparse Contingency Tables
maintainer: Matthew Friedlander
description: Log-linear modeling is a popular method for the analysis of contingency
  table data. When the table is sparse, the data can fall on the boundary of the convex
  support, and we say that "the MLE does not exist" in the sense that some parameters
  cannot be estimated. However, an extended MLE always exists, and a subset of the
  original parameters will be estimable. The 'eMLEloglin' package determines which
  sampling zeros contribute to the non-existence of the MLE. These problematic zero
  cells can be removed from the contingency table and the model can then be fit (as
  far as is possible) using the glm() function.
