  Generalized Berk-Jones Test for Set-Based Inference in Genetic
  Association Studies
maintainer: Ryan Sun
description: |-
  Offers the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for set-based inference in genetic
  association studies. The GBJ is designed as an alternative to tests such as Berk-Jones (BJ),
  Higher Criticism (HC), Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC), Minimum p-value (minP), and Sequence
  Kernel Association Test (SKAT). All of these other methods (except for SKAT) are also implemented
  in this package, and we additionally provide an omnibus test (OMNI) which integrates information from each of the tests.
  The GBJ has been shown to outperform other tests in genetic association studies when signals
  are correlated and moderately sparse. Please see the vignette for a quickstart guide or the paper at
  <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1660170> for full details.
