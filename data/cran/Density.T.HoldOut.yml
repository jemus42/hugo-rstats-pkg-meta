title: 'Density.T.HoldOut: Non-combinatorial T-estimation Hold-Out for<U+000a>density
  estimation'
maintainer: Nelo Magalhães
description: Implementation in the density framework of the non-combinatorial algorithm
  and its greedy version, introduced by Magalhães and Rozenholc (2014), for T-estimation
  Hold-Out proposed in Birgé (2006, Section 9). The package provide an implementation
  which uses several families of estimators (regular and irregular histograms, kernel
  estimators) which may be used alone or combined. As a complement, provides also
  a comparison with other Held-Out derived from least-squares and maximum-likelihood.
  This package implements also the T-estimation Hold-Out derived from the test introduced
  in Baraud (2011).
