title: Create Hyperlinks to Biological Databases and Resources
maintainer: Aaron Wolen
description: |-
  Generate urls and hyperlinks to commonly used biological databases
  and resources based on standard identifiers. This is primarily useful when
  writing dynamic reports that reference things like gene symbols in text or
  tables, allowing you to, for example, convert gene identifiers to hyperlinks
  pointing to their entry in the NCBI Gene database. Currently supports NCBI
  Gene, PubMed, Gene Ontology, CRAN and Bioconductor.
