title: Machine Learning with AdaBoost on Decision Stumps
maintainer: Jadon Wagstaff
description: |-
  Creates classifier for binary outcomes using Adaptive Boosting
  (AdaBoost) algorithm on decision stumps with a fast C++ implementation.
  For a description of AdaBoost, see Freund and Schapire (1997)
  <doi:10.1006/jcss.1997.1504>. This type of classifier is nonlinear, but
  easy to interpret and visualize. Feature vectors may be a combination of
  continuous (numeric) and categorical (string, factor) elements. Methods
  for classifier assessment, predictions, and cross-validation also included.
