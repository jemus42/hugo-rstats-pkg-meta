  Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations for Bivariate Mixed
  Outcomes
maintainer: Ved Deshpande
description: |-
  Perform simultaneous estimation and variable selection for correlated bivariate
  mixed outcomes (one continuous outcome and one binary outcome per cluster) using
  penalized generalized estimating equations. In addition, clustered Gaussian and binary
  outcomes can also be modeled. The SCAD, MCP, and LASSO penalties are supported.
  Cross-validation can be performed to find the optimal regularization parameter(s).
