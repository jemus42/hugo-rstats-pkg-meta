version: '1.3'
title: Medical Risk and Comorbidity Tools for ICD-9-CM Data
maintainer: Patrick McCormick
description: |-
  Generates risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM
  codes available in administrative medical datasets. The package supports
  the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser Comorbidity
  classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and the Risk Stratification
  Index.  Methods are table-based, fast, and use the 'plyr' package, so
  parallelization is possible for large jobs. Also includes a sample of
  real ICD-9 data for 100 patients from a publicly available dataset.
