title: Tree Branches Evaluated Statistically for Tightness
maintainer: Guoli Sun
description: Our method introduces mathematically well-defined measures for tightness
  of branches in a hierarchical tree. Statistical significance of the findings is
  determined, for all branches of the tree, by performing permutation tests, optionally
  with generalized Pareto p-value estimation.
