  Time-Varying DBN Inference with the ARTIVA (Auto Regressive TIme
  VArying) Model
maintainer: S. Lebre
description: |-
  Reversible Jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC)sampling for approximating the posterior
  distribution of a time varying regulatory network, under the Auto Regressive TIme VArying
  (ARTIVA) model (for a detailed description of the algorithm, see Lebre et al. BMC Systems
  Biology, 2010). Starting from time-course gene expression measurements for a gene of
  interest (referred to as "target gene") and a set of genes (referred to as "parent genes")
  which may explain the expression of the target gene, the ARTIVA procedure identifies
  temporal segments for which a set of interactions occur between the "parent genes" and the
  "target gene". The time points that delimit the different temporal segments are referred to
  as changepoints (CP).
