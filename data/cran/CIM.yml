title: Compositional Impact of Migration
maintainer: Nikos Patias
description: |-
  Produces statistical indicators of the impact of migration on the socio-demographic
  composition of an area. Three measures can be used: ratios, percentages and the Duncan index
  of dissimilarity. The input data files are assumed to be in an  origin-destination matrix format,
  with each cell representing a flow count between an origin and a destination area. Columns are expected
  to represent origins, and rows are expected to represent destinations. The first row and column are
  assumed to contain labels for each area. See Rodriguez-Vignoli and Rowe (2018)
  <doi:10.1080/00324728.2017.1416155> for technical details.
