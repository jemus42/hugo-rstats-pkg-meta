title: Feature Extraction for Discretely-Sampled Functional Data
maintainer: Ravi Varadhan
description: |-
  Discretely-sampled function is first smoothed.  Features
  of the smoothed function are then extracted.  Some of the key
  features include mean value, first and second derivatives,
  critical points (i.e. local maxima and minima), curvature of
  cunction at critical points, wiggliness of the function, noise
  in data, and outliers in data.
