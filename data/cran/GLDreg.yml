  Fit GLD Regression Model and GLD Quantile Regression Model to
  Empirical Data
maintainer: Steve Su
description: 'Owing to the rich shapes of Generalised Lambda Distributions (GLDs),
  GLD standard/quantile regression is a competitive flexible model compared to standard/quantile
  regression.  The proposed method has some major advantages: 1) it provides a reference
  line which is very robust to outliers with the attractive property of zero mean
  residuals and 2) it gives a unified, elegant quantile regression model from the
  reference line with smooth regression coefficients across different quantiles. The
  goodness of fit of the proposed model can be assessed via QQ plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  tests and data driven smooth test, to ensure the appropriateness of the statistical
  inference under consideration. Statistical distributions of coefficients of the
  GLD regression line are obtained using simulation, and interval estimates are obtained
  directly from simulated data.'
