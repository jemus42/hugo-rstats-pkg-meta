title: Similarity Network Fusion
maintainer: Daniel Cole
description: Similarity Network Fusion takes multiple views of a network and fuses
  them together to construct an overall status matrix. The input to our algorithm
  can be feature vectors, pairwise distances, or pairwise similarities. The learned
  status matrix can then be used for retrieval, clustering, and classification.
