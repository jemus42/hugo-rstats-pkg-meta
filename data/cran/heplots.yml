title: Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models
maintainer: Michael Friendly
description: |-
  Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
  tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-
  products matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using ellipses (in two
  dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three dimensions). The related 'candisc' package
  provides visualizations in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space when
  there are more than a few response variables.
