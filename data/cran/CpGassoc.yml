title: Association Between Methylation and a Phenotype of Interest
maintainer: R Barfield
description: Is designed to test for association between methylation at CpG sites
  across the genome and a phenotype of interest, adjusting for any relevant covariates.
  The package can perform standard analyses of large datasets very quickly with no
  need to impute the data. It can also handle mixed effects models with chip or batch
  entering the model as a random intercept. Also includes tools to apply quality control
  filters, perform permutation tests, and create QQ plots, manhattan plots, and scatterplots
  for individual CpG sites.
