title: Using Fonts More Easily in R Graphs
maintainer: Yixuan Qiu
description: |-
  Making it easy to use various types of fonts ('TrueType',
  'OpenType', Type 1, web fonts, etc.) in R graphs, and supporting most output
  formats of R graphics including PNG, PDF and SVG. Text glyphs will be converted
  into polygons or raster images, hence after the plot has been created, it no
  longer relies on the font files. No external software such as 'Ghostscript' is
  needed to use this package.
