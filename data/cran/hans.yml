title: Haversines are not Slow
maintainer: Alex Hallam
description: |-
  The haversine is a function used to calculate the distance between a pair of
  latitude and longitude points while accounting for the assumption that the points
  are on a spherical globe. This package provides a fast, dataframe compatible,
  haversine function. For the first publication on the haversine calculation see
  Joseph de Mendoza y RÃ­os (1795) <https://books.google.cat/books?id=030t0OqlX2AC> (In Spanish).
