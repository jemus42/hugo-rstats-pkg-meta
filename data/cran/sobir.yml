title: Significance of Boundaries
maintainer: Ruan de Wet
description: Separates significant boundary constraints in a dataset from illusions.
  A modified permutation test is applied using the no-data zone areas above the top-left,
  top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left boundary lines as test statistics. The observed
  no-data zone areas are compared to the distribution of the random permutations to
  calculate a p-value for each boundary line. An article detailing the methodologies
  and rationale is currently in preparation.
