description: |-
  Implementation of Forecastable Component Analysis ('ForeCA'),
  including main algorithms and auxiliary function (summary, plotting, etc.) to
  apply 'ForeCA' to multivariate time series data. 'ForeCA' is a novel dimension
  reduction (DR) technique for temporally dependent signals. Contrary to other
  popular DR methods, such as 'PCA' or 'ICA', 'ForeCA' takes time dependency
  explicitly into account and searches for the most ''forecastable'' signal.
  The measure of forecastability is based on the Shannon entropy of the spectral
  density of the transformed signal.
