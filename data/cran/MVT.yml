maintainer: Felipe Osorio
description: |-
  Routines to perform estimation and inference under the multivariate t-distribution.
  Currently, the following methodologies are implemented: multivariate mean and covariance
  estimation, hypothesis testing about the mean, equicorrelation and homogeneity of variances,
  the Wilson-Hilferty transformation, QQ-plots with envelopes and random variate
  generation. Some auxiliary functions are also provided.
