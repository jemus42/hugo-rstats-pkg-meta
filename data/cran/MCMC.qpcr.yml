title: Bayesian Analysis of qRT-PCR Data
maintainer: Mikhail V. Matz
description: 'Quantitative RT-PCR data are analyzed using generalized linear mixed
  models based on lognormal-Poisson error distribution, fitted using MCMC. Control
  genes are not required but can be incorporated as Bayesian priors or, when template
  abundances correlate with conditions, as trackers of global effects (common to all
  genes). The package also implements a lognormal model for higher-abundance data
  and a "classic" model involving multi-gene normalization on a by-sample basis. Several
  plotting functions are included to extract and visualize results. The detailed tutorial
  is available here: <https://matzlab.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/2/2/76229469/mcmc.qpcr.tutorial.v1.2.4.pdf>.'
