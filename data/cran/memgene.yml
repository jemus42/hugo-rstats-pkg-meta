  Spatial Pattern Detection in Genetic Distance Data Using Moran's
  Eigenvector Maps
maintainer: Paul Galpern
description: Can detect relatively weak spatial genetic patterns by using Moran's
  Eigenvector Maps (MEM) to extract only the spatial component of genetic variation.  Has
  applications in landscape genetics where the movement and dispersal of organisms
  are studied using neutral genetic variation.
