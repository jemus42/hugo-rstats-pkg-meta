title: Creating Contact and Social Networks
maintainer: Trevor Farthing
description: |-
  Process spatially- and temporally-discrete data into contact and
  social networks, and facilitate network analysis by randomizing
  individuals' movement paths and/or related categorical variables. To use
  this package, users need only have a dataset containing spatial data
  (i.e., latitude/longitude, or planar x & y coordinates), individual IDs
  relating spatial data to specific individuals, and date/time information
  relating spatial locations to temporal locations. The functionality of this
  package ranges from data "cleaning" via multiple filtration functions, to
  spatial and temporal data interpolation, and network creation and analysis.
  Functions within this package are not limited to describing interpersonal
  contacts. Package functions can also identify and quantify "contacts"
  between individuals and fixed areas (e.g., home ranges, water bodies,
  buildings, etc.). As such, this package is an incredibly useful resource
  for facilitating epidemiological, ecological, ethological and sociological
  research.
