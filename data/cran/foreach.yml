title: Provides Foreach Looping Construct
maintainer: Hong Ooi
description: |-
  Support for the foreach looping construct.  Foreach is an
  idiom that allows for iterating over elements in a collection,
  without the use of an explicit loop counter.  This package in
  particular is intended to be used for its return value, rather
  than for its side effects.  In that sense, it is similar to the
  standard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation
  of a function.  Using foreach without side effects also
  facilitates executing the loop in parallel.
