title: A Forward Agent-Based Transmission Chain Simulator
maintainer: Sebastian Lequime
description: The aim of 'nosoi' (pronounced no.si) is to provide a flexible agent-based
  stochastic transmission chain/epidemic simulator (Lequime et al. bioRxiv 2020.03.03.973107).
  It is named after the daimones of plague, sickness and disease that escaped Pandora's
  jar in the Greek mythology. 'nosoi' is able to take into account the influence of
  multiple variable on the transmission process (e.g. dual-host systems (such as arboviruses),
  within-host viral dynamics, transportation, population structure), alone or taken
  together, to create complex but relatively intuitive epidemiological simulations.
