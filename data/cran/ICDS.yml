description: 'Identify Cancer Dysfunctional Sub-pathway by integrating gene expression,
  DNA methylation and copy number variation, and pathway topological information.
  1)We firstly calculate the gene risk scores by integrating three kinds of data:
  DNA methylation, copy number variation, and gene expression.  2)Secondly, we perform
  a greedy search algorithm to identify the key dysfunctional sub-pathways within
  the pathways for which the discriminative scores were locally maximal. 3)Finally,
  the permutation test was used to calculate statistical significance level for these
  key dysfunctional sub-pathways.'
