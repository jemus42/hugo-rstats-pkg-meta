description: Quantitative trait loci mapping and genome wide association analysis
  are used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated with phenotype
  based on linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium. Gene expression quantitative
  trait loci mapping is used to find candidate molecular marker or region associated
  with gene expression. In this package, we applied the method in Liu W. (2011) <doi:10.1007/s00122-011-1631-7>
  and Gusev A. (2016) <doi:10.1038/ng.3506> to genome and transcriptome wide association
  study, which is aimed at revealing the association relationship between phenotype
  and molecular markers, expression levels, molecular markers nested within different
  related expression effect and expression effect nested within different related
  molecular marker effect. F test based on full and reduced model are performed to
  obtain p value or likelihood ratio statistic. The best linear model can be obtained
  by stepwise regression analysis.
