title: Multistage Allocation
maintainer: Andrea Fasulo
description: Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two
  stages stratified sample design. R2BEAT extends the Neyman (1934) <doi:10.2307/2342192>
  – Tschuprow (1923) allocation method to the case of several variables, adopting
  a generalization of the Bethel’s proposal (1989). R2BEAT develops this methodology
  but, moreover, it allows to determine the sample allocation in the multivariate
  and multi-domains case of estimates for two-stage stratified samples.
