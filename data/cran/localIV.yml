  Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects using Local
  Instrumental Variables
maintainer: Xiang Zhou
description: |-
  In the generalized Roy model, the marginal treatment effect (MTE) can be used as
  a building block for constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average treatment
  effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Given a treatment selection
  equation and an outcome equation, the function mte() estimates the MTE via the semiparametric
  local instrumental variables method or the normal selection model. The function mte_at() evaluates
  MTE at different values of the latent resistance u with a given X = x, and the function mte_tilde_at()
  evaluates MTE projected onto the estimated propensity score. The function ace() estimates
  population-level average causal effects such as ATE, ATT, or the marginal policy relevant
  treatment effect.
