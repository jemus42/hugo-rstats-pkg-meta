maintainer: Joseph Lipoff
description: Due to 'Rstudio's' status as open source software, we believe it will
  be utilized frequently for future data analysis by users whom lack formal training
  or experience with 'R'. The 'NMVANOVA' (Novice Model Variation ANOVA) a streamlined
  variation of experimental design functions that allows novice 'Rstudio' users to
  perform different model variations one-way analysis of variance without downloading  multiple
  libraries or packages. Users can easily manipulate the data block, and needed inputs
  so that users only have to plugin the four designed variables/values.
