title: Wrapper for 'SUNDIALS' Solving ODE and Sensitivity Problem
maintainer: Serguei Sokol
description: Wrapper for widely used 'SUNDIALS' software (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic
  Equation Solvers) and more precisely to its 'CVODES' solver. It is aiming to solve
  ordinary differential equations (ODE) and optionally pending forward sensitivity
  problem. The wrapper is made 'R' friendly by allowing to pass custom parameters
  to user's callback functions. Such functions can be both written in 'R' and in 'C++'
  ('RcppArmadillo' flavor). In case of 'C++', performance is greatly improved so this
  option is highly advisable when performance matters. If provided, Jacobian matrix
  can be calculated either in dense or sparse format. In the latter case 'rmumps'
  package is used to solve corresponding linear systems. Root finding and pending
  event management are optional and can be specified as 'R' or 'C++' functions too.
  This makes them a very flexible tool for controlling the ODE system during the time
  course simulation. 'SUNDIALS' library was published in Hindmarsh et al. (2005) <doi:10.1145/1089014.1089020>.
