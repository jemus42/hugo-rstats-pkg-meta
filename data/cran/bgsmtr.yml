title: Bayesian Group Sparse Multi-Task Regression
maintainer: Yin Song
description: Implementation of Bayesian multi-task regression models and was developed
  within the context of imaging genetics. The package can currently fit two models.
  The Bayesian group sparse multi-task regression model of Greenlaw et al. (2017)<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx215>
  can be fit with implementation using Gibbs sampling. An extension of this model
  developed by Song, Ge et al. to accommodate both spatial correlation as well as
  correlation across brain hemispheres can also be fit using either mean-field variational
  Bayes or Gibbs sampling. The model can also be used more generally for multivariate
  (non-imaging) phenotypes with spatial correlation.
