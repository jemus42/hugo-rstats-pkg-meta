title: Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis model for the inference of<U+000a>pathways
  responsive to drug treatment
maintainer: Haisu Ma
description: This method tries to explain the gene-wise treatment response ratios
  in terms of the latent pathways. It uses bayesian sparse factor modeling to infer
  the loadings (weights) of each pathway on its associated probesets as well as the
  latent factor activity levels for each treatment.
