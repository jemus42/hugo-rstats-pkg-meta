title: Interaction Analysis of Repeated Measure Data
maintainer: Fei Zhou
description: Extensive penalized variable selection methods have been developed in
  the past two decades for analyzing high dimensional omics data, such as gene expressions,
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and others.
  However, lipidomics data have been rarely investigated by using high dimensional
  variable selection methods. This package incorporates our recently developed penalization
  procedures to conduct interaction analysis for high dimensional lipidomics data
  with repeated measurements. The core module of this package is developed in C++.
  The development of this software package and the associated statistical methods
  have been partially supported by an Innovative Research Award from Johnson Cancer
  Research Center, Kansas State University.
