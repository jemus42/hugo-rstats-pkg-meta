description: |-
  Facilitate  inventory analysis calculations,pricing and promotions calculations.
  the package includes calculations of inventory metrics, profit calculations and ABC analysis calculations.
  This version has only normal and Poisson distributions but I am hoping that other distributions will follow in later versions.
