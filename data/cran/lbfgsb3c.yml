  Interfacing to Nocedal et al. L-BFGS-B.3.0
  (See <http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html>)
  limited memory BFGS minimizer with bounds on parameters.
  This is a fork of 'lbfgsb3'.
  This registers a 'R' compatible 'C' interface to L-BFGS-B.3.0 that uses the same
  function types and optimization as the optim() function (see writing 'R' extensions
  and source for details).  This package also adds more stopping criteria as well
  as allowing the adjustment of more tolerances.
