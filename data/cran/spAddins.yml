title: A Set of RStudio Addins
maintainer: Vilmantas Gegzna
description: |-
  A set of RStudio addins that are designed to be used in
  combination with user-defined RStudio keyboard shortcuts. These
  addins either:
  1) insert text at a cursor position (e.g. insert
  operators %>%, <<-, %$%, etc.),
  2) replace symbols in selected pieces of text (e.g., convert
  backslashes to forward slashes which results in stings like
  "c:\data\" converted into "c:/data/") or
  3) enclose text with special symbols (e.g., converts "bold" into
  "**bold**") which is convenient for editing R Markdown files.
