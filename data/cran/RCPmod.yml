title: Regions of Common Profiles Modelling with Mixtures-of-Experts
maintainer: Scott Foster
description: Identifies regions of common (species) profiles (RCPs), possibly when
  sampling artefacts are present.  Within a region the probability of sampling all
  species remains approximately constant.  This is performed using mixtures-of-experts
  models.  The package also contains associated methods, such as diagnostics.
