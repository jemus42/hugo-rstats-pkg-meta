title: Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis
maintainer: Alexander Robitzsch
description: |2-

  Conducts moderated nonlinear factor analysis (e.g., Curran et al., 2014,
  <doi:10.1080/00273171.2014.889594>).
  Regularization methods are implemented for assessing non-invariant items.
  Currently, the package includes dichotomous items and unidimensional
