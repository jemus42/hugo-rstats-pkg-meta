title: Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping
maintainer: Adam Clark
description: The multispatial convergent cross mapping algorithm can be used as a
  test for causal associations between pairs of processes represented by time series.
  This is a combination of convergent cross mapping (CCM), described in Sugihara et
  al., 2012, Science, 338, 496-500, and dew-drop regression, described in Hsieh et
  al., 2008, American Naturalist, 171, 71â€“80. The algorithm allows CCM to be implemented
  on data that are not from a single long time series. Instead, data can come from
  many short time series, which are stitched together using bootstrapping.
