title: Correlation and Regression Analyses for Randomized Response Data

description: |2-

  Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized response
  (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965). Randomized response: A
  survey technique for eliminating evasive answer bias. Journal of the
  American Statistical Association, 60, 63–69, <doi:10.2307/2283137>).
  Besides univariate estimates of true proportions, RR variables can be used
  for correlations, as dependent variable in a logistic regression (with or
  without random effects), or as predictors in a linear regression
  (Heck, D. W., & Moshagen, M. (2018). RRreg: An R package for correlation and
  regression analyses of randomized response data. Journal of Statistical
  Software, 85(2), 1–29, <doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i02>). For simulations and
  the estimation of statistical power, RR data can be generated according to
  several models. The implemented methods also allow to test the link between
  continuous covariates and dishonesty in cheating paradigms such as the
  coin-toss or dice-roll task (Moshagen, M., & Hilbig, B. E. (2017).
