title: Particle Tracking and Demography
maintainer: Marjolein Bruijning
description: Obtain population density and body size structure, using video material
  or image sequences as input. Functions assist in the creation of image sequences
  from videos, background detection and subtraction, particle identification and tracking.
  An artificial neural network can be trained for noise filtering. The goal is to
  supply accurate estimates of population size, structure and/or individual behavior,
  for use in  evolutionary and ecological studies.
