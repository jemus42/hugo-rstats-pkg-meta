  Robust and Sparse Methods for High Dimensional Linear and
  Logistic Regression
maintainer: Fatma Sevinc Kurnaz
description: Fully robust versions of the elastic net estimator are introduced for
  linear and logistic regression, in particular high dimensional data by Kurnaz, Hoffmann
  and Filzmoser (2017) <DOI:10.1016/j.chemolab.2017.11.017>. The algorithm searches
  for outlier free subsets on which the classical elastic net estimators can be applied.
