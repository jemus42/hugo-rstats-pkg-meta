maintainer: Erica Ponzi
description: Generalization of the SIMEX algorithm from Cook & Stefanski (1994) <doi:10.2307/2290994>
  for the calculation of inbreeding depression or heritability on pedigree structures
  affected by missing or misassigned paternities. It simulates errors and tracks the
  behavior of the estimate as a function of the error proportion. It extrapolates
  back a true value corresponding to the null error rate.
