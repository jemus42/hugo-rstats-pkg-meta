title: Selecting a Predictive Function for a Given Gene Expression Data
maintainer: Victor L Jong
description: The recent advancement of high-throughput technologies has led to frequent
  utilization of gene expression and other "omics" data for toxicological, diagnostic
  or prognostic studies in and clinical applications. Unlike in classical predictions
  where the number of samples is greater than the number of variables (n>p), the challenge
  faced with prediction using "omics" data is that the number of parameters greatly
  exceeds the number of samples (p>>n). To solve this curse of dimensionality problem,
  several predictive functions have been proposed for direct and probabilistic classification
  and survival predictions. Nevertheless, these predictive functions have been shown
  to perform differently across datasets. Comparing predictive functions and choosing
  the best is computationally intensive and leads to selection bias. Thus, the question
  which function should one choose for a given dataset is to be ascertained. This
  package implements the approach proposed by Jong et al., (2016) to address this
  question.
