  Unsupervised Photometric Membership Assignment in Stellar
  Clusters
maintainer: Alberto Krone-Martins
description: |-
  An implementation of the UPMASK method for performing membership
  assignment in stellar clusters in R. It is prepared to use photometry and
  spatial positions, but it can take into account other types of data. The
  method is able to take into account arbitrary error models, and it is
  unsupervised, data-driven, physical-model-free and relies on as few
  assumptions as possible. The approach followed for membership assessment is
  based on an iterative process, dimensionality reduction, a clustering
  algorithm and a kernel density estimation.
