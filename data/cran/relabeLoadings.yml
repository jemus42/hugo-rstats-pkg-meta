  Relabel Loadings from MCMC Output for Confirmatory Factor
  Analysis
maintainer: S. McKay Curtis
description: |-
  In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural constraints
  typically ensure that the model is identified up to all possible reflections,
  i.e., column sign changes of the matrix of loadings. Such reflection invariance
  is problematic for Bayesian CFA when the reflection modes are not well separated
  in the posterior distribution. Imposing rotational constraints -- fixing
  some loadings to be zero or positive in order to pick a factor solution that
  corresponds to one reflection mode -- may not provide a satisfactory solution
  for Bayesian CFA. The function 'relabel' uses the relabeling algorithm of
  Erosheva and Curtis to correct for sign invariance in MCMC draws from CFA
  models. The MCMC draws should come from Bayesian CFA models that are fit without
  rotational constraints.
