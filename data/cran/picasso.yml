title: Pathwise Calibrated Sparse Shooting Algorithm
maintainer: Jason Ge
description: Computationally efficient tools for fitting generalized linear model
  with convex or non-convex penalty. Users can enjoy the superior statistical property
  of non-convex penalty such as SCAD and MCP which has significantly less estimation
  error and overfitting compared to convex penalty such as lasso and ridge. Computation
  is handled by multi-stage convex relaxation and the PathwIse CAlibrated Sparse Shooting
  algOrithm (PICASSO) which exploits warm start initialization, active set updating,
  and strong rule for coordinate preselection to boost computation, and attains a
  linear convergence to a unique sparse local optimum with optimal statistical properties.
  The computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output.
