title: Hierarchical Community Detection by Recursive Partitioning
maintainer: Tianxi Li
description: Hierarchical community detection on networks by a recursive spectral
  partitioning strategy, which is shown to be effective and efficient in Li, Lei,
  Bhattacharyya, Sarkar, Bickel, and Levina (2018) <arXiv:1810.01509>. The package
  also includes a data generating function for a binary tree stochastic block model,
  a special case of stochastic block model that admits hierarchy between communities.
