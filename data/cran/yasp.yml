title: String Functions for Compact R Code
maintainer: Tomasz Kalinowski
description: |-
  A collection of string functions designed for writing
  compact and expressive R code. 'yasp' (Yet Another String Package) is simple,
  fast, dependency-free, and written in pure R. The package provides: a
  coherent set of abbreviations for paste() from package 'base' with a
  variety of defaults, such as p() for "paste" and pcc() for "paste and
  collapse with commas"; wrap(), bracket(), and others for wrapping a
  string in flanking characters; unwrap() for removing pairs of characters
  (at any position in a string); and sentence() for cleaning whitespace
  around punctuation and capitalization appropriate for prose sentences.
