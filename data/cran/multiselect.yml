  Selecting Combinations of Predictors by Leveraging Multiple AUCs
  for an Ordered Multilevel Outcome
maintainer: Allison Meisner
description: Uses multiple AUCs to select a combination of predictors when the outcome
  has multiple (ordered) levels and the focus is discriminating one particular level
  from the others. This method is most naturally applied to settings where the outcome
  has three levels. (Meisner, A, Parikh, CR, and Kerr, KF (2017) <http://biostats.bepress.com/uwbiostat/paper423/>.)
