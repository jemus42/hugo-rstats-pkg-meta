title: Fast Hierarchical Clustering Routines for R and 'Python'
maintainer: Daniel MÃ¼llner
description: |-
  This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to
  both R and 'Python'. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative
  clustering routines. Part of the functionality is designed as drop-in
  replacement for existing routines: linkage() in the 'SciPy' package
  'scipy.cluster.hierarchy', hclust() in R's 'stats' package, and the
  'flashClust' package. It provides the same functionality with the
  benefit of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are
  memory-saving routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond
  what the existing packages provide. For information on how to install
  the 'Python' files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution.
  Based on the present package, Christoph Dalitz also wrote a pure 'C++'
  interface to 'fastcluster':
