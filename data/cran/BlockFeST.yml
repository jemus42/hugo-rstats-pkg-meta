description: An R implementation of an extension of the 'BayeScan' software (Foll,
  2008) <DOI:10.1534/genetics.108.092221> for codominant markers, adding the option
  to group individual SNPs into pre-defined blocks. A typical application of this
  new approach is the identification of genomic regions, genes, or gene sets containing
  one or more SNPs that evolved under directional selection.
