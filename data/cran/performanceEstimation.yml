  An Infra-Structure for Performance Estimation of Predictive
  Models
maintainer: Luis Torgo
description: |-
  An infra-structure for estimating the predictive performance of
  predictive models. In this context, it can also be used to compare and/or select
  among different alternative ways of solving one or more predictive tasks. The
  main goal of the package is to provide a generic infra-structure to estimate
  the values of different metrics of predictive performance using different
  estimation procedures. These estimation tasks can be applied to any solutions
  (workflows) to the predictive tasks. The package provides easy to use standard
  workflows that allow the usage of any available R modeling algorithm together
  with some pre-defined data pre-processing steps and also prediction post-
  processing methods. It also provides means for addressing issues related with
  the statistical significance of the observed differences.
