  Partitioning Hierarchical Diversity and Differentiation Across
  Metrics and Scales, from Genes to Ecosystems
maintainer: Xinghu Qin
description: Miscellaneous R functions for calculating and decomposing hierarchical
  diversity metrics, including hierarchical allele richness, hierarchical exponential
  Shannon entropy (true diversity of order q=1), hierarchical heterozygosity and genetic
  differentiation (Jaccard dissimilarity, Delta D,Fst and Jost's D). In addition,a
  new approach to identify population structure based on the homogeneity of multivariate
  variances of Shannon differentiation is presented. This package allows you to analyse
  spatial structured genetic data or species data under a unifying framework (Gaggiotti,
  O. E. et al, 2018, Evol Appl, 11:1176-1193; <DOI:10.1111/eva.12593>), which partitions
  diversity and differentiation into any hierarchical levels. It helps you easily
  structure and format your data. In summary,it implements the analyses of true diversity
  profiles (q=0,1,2), hierarchical diversities and differentiation decomposition,
  visualization of population structure, as well as the estimation of correlation
  between geographic distance and genetic differentiation.
