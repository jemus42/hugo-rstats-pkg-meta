  Semiparametric efficient estimation for a two-sample treatment
  effect
maintainer: Michal Juraska
description: |-
  The package performs estimation and testing of the
  treatment effect in a 2-group randomized clinical trial with a
  quantitative, dichotomous, or right-censored time-to-event
  endpoint. The method improves efficiency by leveraging baseline
  predictors of the endpoint. The inverse probability weighting
  technique of Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (JASA, 1994) is used
  to provide unbiased estimation when the endpoint is missing at
  random.
