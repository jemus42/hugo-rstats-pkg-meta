  Knowledge space theory by Doignon and Falmagne (1999)
  <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58625-5> is a set- and order-theoretical
  framework, which proposes mathematical formalisms to operationalize
  knowledge structures in a particular domain. The 'kstMatrix' package
  provides basic functionalities to generate, handle, and manipulate
  knowledge structures and knowledge spaces. Opposed to the 'kst'
  package, 'kstMatrix' uses matrix representations for knowledge
  structures. Furthermore, 'kstMatrix' contains several knowledge spaces
  developed by the research group around Cornelia Dowling through
  querying experts.
