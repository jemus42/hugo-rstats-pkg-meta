description: |-
  Specific dimension reduction methods for replicated graphs
  (multiple undirected graphs repeatedly measured on a common set of
  nodes). The package contains efficient procedures for estimating
  a shared baseline propensity matrix and graph-specific low rank
  matrices. The algorithm uses block coordinate descent algorithm to
  solve the model, which alternatively performs L2-penalized logistic
  regression and multiple partial eigenvalue decompositions, as described
  in the paper Wang et al. (2017) <arXiv:1707.06360>.
