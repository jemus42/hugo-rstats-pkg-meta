title: Parse 'User-Agent' Strings
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  Despite there being a section in RFC 7231
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3> defining a suggested
  structure for 'User-Agent' headers this data is notoriously difficult
  to parse consistently. Tools are provided that will take in user agent
  strings and return structured R objects. This is a 'V8'-backed package
  based on the 'ua-parser' project <https://github.com/ua-parser>.
