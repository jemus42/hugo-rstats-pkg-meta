title: Quantify United States County-Level Flood Measurements
maintainer: Rod Lammers
description: |-
  Quantifies United States flood impacts at the county level using
  United States Geological Service (USGS) River Discharge data for the USGS
  API. This package builds on R packages from the USGS, with the goal of
  creating county-level time series of flood status that can be more easily
  joined with county-level impact measurements, including health outcomes.
