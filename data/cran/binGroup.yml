title: Evaluation and Experimental Design for Binomial Group Testing
maintainer: Frank Schaarschmidt
description: |-
  Methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of proportions
  in group testing designs: methods for estimating a proportion in a single
  population (assuming sensitivity and specificity equal to 1 in designs
  with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis tests and
  functions for experimental design for this situation. For
  estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions, a
  number of confidence interval methods are included, which can
  deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression
  methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling
  designs.
  Methods for identification of positive items in group
  testing designs: Optimal testing configurations can be found
  for hierarchical and array-based algorithms. Operating
  characteristics can be calculated for testing configurations
  across a wide variety of situations.
