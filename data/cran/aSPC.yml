  An Adaptive Sum of Powered Correlation Test (aSPC) for Global
  Association Between Two Random Vectors
maintainer: Zhiyuan (Jason) Xu
description: The aSPC test is designed to test global association between two groups
  of variables potentially with moderate to high dimension (e.g. in hundreds). The
  aSPC is particularly useful when the association signals between two groups of variables
  are sparse.
