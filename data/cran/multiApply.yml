title: Apply Functions to Multiple Multidimensional Arrays or Vectors
maintainer: Nuria Perez
description: |-
  The base apply function and its variants, as well as the related
  functions in the 'plyr' package, typically apply user-defined functions to a
  single argument (or a list of vectorized arguments in the case of mapply). The
  'multiApply' package extends this paradigm with its only function, Apply, which
  efficiently applies functions taking one or a list of multiple unidimensional
  or multidimensional arrays (or combinations thereof) as input. The input
  arrays can have different numbers of dimensions as well as different dimension
  lengths, and the applied function can return one or a list of unidimensional or
  multidimensional arrays as output. This saves development time by preventing the
  R user from writing often error-prone and memory-inefficient loops dealing with
  multiple complex arrays. Also, a remarkable feature of Apply is the transparent
  use of multi-core through its parameter 'ncores'. In contrast to the base apply
  function, this package suggests the use of 'target dimensions' as opposite
  to the 'margins' for specifying the dimensions relevant to the function to be
  applied.
