  Client for many 'NOAA' data sources including the 'NCDC' climate
  'API' at <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2>, with functions for
  each of the 'API' 'endpoints': data, data categories, data sets, data types,
  locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we have an interface

  Observing 'Metadata' Repository ('HOMR') data, 'NOAA' storm data via 'IBTrACS',
  tornado data via the 'NOAA' storm prediction center, and more.
