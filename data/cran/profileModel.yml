version: 0.6.0
title: Profiling Inference Functions for Various Model Classes
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: Provides tools that can be used to calculate, evaluate, plot and use
  for inference the profiles of *arbitrary* inference functions for *arbitrary* 'glm'-like
  fitted models with linear predictors. More information on the methods that are implemented
  can be found in Kosmidis (2008) <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-2.pdf>.
