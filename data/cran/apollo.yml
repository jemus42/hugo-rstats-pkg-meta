title: Tools for Choice Model Estimation and Application
maintainer: David Palma
description: |-
  The Choice Modelling Centre (CMC) at the University of Leeds
  has developed flexible code for the estimation and application
  of choice models in R. Users are able to write their own
  model functions or use a mix of already available ones. Random heterogeneity,
  both continuous and discrete and at the level of individuals and
  choices, can be incorporated for all models. There is support for both standalone
  models and hybrid model structures.  Both classical
  and Bayesian estimation is available, and multiple discrete
  continuous models are covered in addition to discrete choice.
  Multi-threading processing is supported for estimation and a large
  number of pre and post-estimation routines, including for computing posterior
  (individual-level) distributions are available.

  models see Train, K. (2009) <isbn:978-0-521-74738-7> and Hess,
  S. & Daly, A.J. (2014) <isbn:978-1-781-00314-5> for an overview
  of the field.
