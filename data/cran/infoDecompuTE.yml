title: Information Decomposition of Two-Phase Experiments
maintainer: Kevin Chang
description: |-
  The main purpose of this package is to generate the structure of the analysis of variance
  (ANOVA) table of the two-phase experiments. The user only need to input the design and the
  relationships of the random and fixed factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers' syntax,
  this package can then quickly generate the structure of the ANOVA table with the
  coefficients of the variance components for the expected mean squares.
  Thus, the balanced incomplete block design and provides the efficiency
  factors of the fixed effects can also be studied and compared much easily.
