title: Disciplined Convex Programming in R using 'Convex.jl'
maintainer: Changcheng Li
description: |-
  Provides a simple high-level wrapper for
  'Julia' package 'Convex.jl' (see <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl> for
  more information),
  which makes it easy to describe and solve convex optimization problems in R.
  The problems can be dealt with include:
  linear programs,
  second-order cone programs,
  semidefinite programs,
  exponential cone programs.
