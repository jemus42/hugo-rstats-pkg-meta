  Calculates "vectorial Kappa", an index of congruence between
  patchy mosaics.
maintainer: Vincent Bonhomme
description: |-
  this package allows to quantify the congruence between two patchy
  mosaics or landscapes. This "vectorial Kappa" approach extends the
  principle of Cohen's Kappa index by calculating areas of intersected
  patches between two mosaics rather than agreement between pixels. It
  provides an exact alternative for patchy mosaics when a Kappa index is
  needed.
