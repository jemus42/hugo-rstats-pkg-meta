title: Simulates Data from a Data Frame of Different Variable Types
maintainer: Lily Zhang
description: |-
  Generates fake data from a dataset of different variable types.
  The package contains the functions simulate_dataset and simulate_dataset_ts
  to simulate time-independent and time-dependent data. It randomly samples
  character and factor variables from contingency tables and  numeric and
  ordered factors from a multivariate normal distribution. It currently supports the
  simulation of stationary and zero-inflated count time series.
