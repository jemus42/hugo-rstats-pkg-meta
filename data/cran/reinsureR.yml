title: Reinsurance Treaties Application
maintainer: Arnaud Buzzi
description: |-
  Application of reinsurance treaties to claims portfolios.
  The package creates a class Claims whose objective is to
  store claims and premiums, on which different treaties can be applied.
  A statistical analysis can then be applied to measure the impact of
  reinsurance, producing a table or graphical output. This package can
  be used for estimating the impact of reinsurance on several portfolios
  or for pricing treaties through statistical analysis. Documentation
  for the implemented methods can be found in "Reinsurance: Actuarial
  and Statistical Aspects" by Hansj√∂erg Albrecher, Jan Beirlant,
  Jozef L. Teugels (2017, ISBN: 978-0-470-77268-3) and
