title: Automatic Differentiation with Dual Numbers
maintainer: Luca Sartore
description: |-
  Automatic differentiation is achieved by using dual numbers without
  providing hand-coded gradient functions. The output value of a mathematical
  function is returned with the values of its exact first derivative
  (or gradient). For more details see Baydin, Pearlmutter, Radul, and Siskind
  (2018) <http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/17-468/17-468.pdf>.
