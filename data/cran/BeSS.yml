title: Best Subset Selection in Linear, Logistic and CoxPH Models
maintainer: Canhong Wen
description: An implementation of best subset selection in generalized linear model
  and Cox proportional hazard model via the primal dual active set algorithm proposed
  by Wen, C., Zhang, A., Quan, S. and Wang, X. (2017) <arXiv:1709.06254>. The algorithm
  formulates coefficient parameters and residuals as primal and dual variables and
  utilizes efficient active set selection strategies based on the complementarity
  of the primal and dual variables.
