maintainer: Scott Chamberlain
description: |-
  Work with 'GitHub' 'gists' from 'R' (e.g.,
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist>,
  <https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/>). A 'gist'
  is simply one or more files with code/text/images/etc. This package allows
  the user to create new 'gists', update 'gists' with new files, rename files,
  delete files, get and delete 'gists', star and 'un-star' 'gists', fork 'gists',
  open a 'gist' in your default browser, get embed code for a 'gist', list
  'gist' 'commits', and get rate limit information when 'authenticated'. Some
  requests require authentication and some do not. 'Gists' website:
  <https://gist.github.com/>.
