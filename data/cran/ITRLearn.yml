title: Statistical Learning for Individualized Treatment Regime
maintainer: Chengchun Shi
description: |-
  Maximin-projection learning (MPL, Shi, et al., 2018) is implemented for
  recommending a meaningful and reliable individualized treatment regime for future
  groups of patients based on the observed data from different populations with
  heterogeneity in individualized decision making. Q-learning and A-learning are
  implemented for estimating the groupwise contrast function that shares the same
  marginal treatment effects. The packages contains classical Q-learning and A-learning
  algorithms for a single stage study as a byproduct. More functions will be added
  at later versions.
