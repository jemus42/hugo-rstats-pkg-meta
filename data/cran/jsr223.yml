  A 'Java' Platform Integration for 'R' with Programming Languages
  'Groovy', 'JavaScript', 'JRuby' ('Ruby'), 'Jython' ('Python'),
  and 'Kotlin'
maintainer: Floid R. Gilbert
description: Provides a high-level integration for the 'Java' platform that makes
  'Java' objects easy to use from within 'R'; provides a unified interface to integrate
  'R' with several programming languages; and features extensive data exchange between
  'R' and 'Java'. The 'jsr223'-supported programming languages include 'Groovy', 'JavaScript',
  'JRuby' ('Ruby'), 'Jython' ('Python'), and 'Kotlin'. Any of these languages can
  use and extend 'Java' classes in natural syntax. Furthermore, solutions developed
  in any of the 'jsr223'-supported languages are also accessible to 'R' developers.
  The 'jsr223' package also features callbacks, script compiling, and string interpolation.
  In all, 'jsr223' significantly extends the computing capabilities of the 'R' software
  environment.
