  Deep Gaussian mixture models as proposed by Viroli and McLachlan (2019)
  <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9793-z> provide a generalization of classical Gaussian mixtures
  to multiple layers. Each layer contains a set of latent variables that follow
  a mixture of Gaussian distributions. To avoid overparameterized solutions, dimension
  reduction is applied at each layer by way of factor models.
