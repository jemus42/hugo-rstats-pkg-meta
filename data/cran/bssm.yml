  Models

description: |-
  Efficient methods for Bayesian inference of state space models
  via particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and parallel importance sampling type weighted
  Markov chain Monte Carlo (Vihola, Helske, and Franks, 2017, <arXiv:1609.02541>).
  Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, or negative binomial
  observation densities and basic stochastic volatility models with Gaussian state
  dynamics, as well as general non-linear Gaussian models and discretised diffusion models
  are supported.
