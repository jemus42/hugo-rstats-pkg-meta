title: Actuarial Functions for Non-Life Insurance Modelling
maintainer: Yiannis Parizas
description: |-
  Assists actuaries and other insurance modellers in pricing,
  reserving and capital modelling for non-life insurance and
  reinsurance modelling. Provides functions that help model
  excess levels, capping and pure Incurred but not reported
  claims (pure IBNR).
  Includes capped mean, exposure curves and increased limit
  factor curves (ILFs) for LogNormal, Gamma, Pareto, Sliced
  LogNormal-Pareto and Sliced Gamma-Pareto distributions.
  Includes mean, probability density function (pdf), cumulative
  probability function (cdf) and inverse cumulative probability
  function for Sliced LogNormal-Pareto and Sliced Gamma-Pareto
  distributions.
  Includes calculating pure IBNR exposure with LogNormal and
  Gamma distribution for reporting delay.
