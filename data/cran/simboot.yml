title: Simultaneous Inference for Diversity Indices
maintainer: Ralph Scherer
description: Provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic confidence
  intervals for diversity indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index. Several
  pre--specified multiple comparison types are available to choose. Further user--defined
  contrast matrices are applicable. In addition, simboot estimates adjusted as well
  as unadjusted p--values for two of the three proposed bootstrap methods. Further
  simboot allows for comparing biological diversities of two or more groups while
  simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which
  are considered as appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.
