title: Parametric Time to Event Analysis
maintainer: Zachary McCaw
description: Performs maximum likelihood based estimation and inference on time to
  event data, possibly subject to non-informative right censoring. fitParaSurv() provides
  maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and distributional characteristics,
  including the mean, median, variance, and restricted mean. compParaSurv() compares
  the mean, median, and restricted mean survival experiences of two treatment groups.
  Candidate distributions include the exponential, gamma, generalized gamma, log-normal,
  and Weibull.
