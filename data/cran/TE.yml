title: Insertion/Deletion Dynamics for Transposable Elements
maintainer: Xiongtao Dai
description: Provides functions to estimate the insertion and deletion rates of transposable
  element (TE) families. The estimation of insertion rate consists of an improved
  estimate of the age distribution that takes into account random mutations, and an
  adjustment by the deletion rate. A hypothesis test for a uniform insertion rate
  is also implemented. This package implements the methods proposed in Dai et al (2018).
