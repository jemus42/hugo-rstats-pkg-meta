title: Derive MCMC Parameters
maintainer: Joe Thorley
description: |-
  Generates derived parameter(s) from Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
  samples using R code. This allows Bayesian models to be fitted without the
  inclusion of derived parameters which add unnecessary clutter and
  slow model fitting. For more information on MCMC samples see
  Brooks et al. (2011) <isbn:978-1-4200-7941-8>.
