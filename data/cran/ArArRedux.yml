  Rigorous Data Reduction and Error Propagation of Ar40 / Ar39
  Data
maintainer: Pieter Vermeesch
description: Processes noble gas mass spectrometer data to determine the isotopic
  composition of argon (comprised of Ar36, Ar37, Ar38, Ar39 and Ar40) released from
  neutron-irradiated potassium-bearing minerals. Then uses these compositions to calculate
  precise and accurate geochronological ages for multiple samples as well as the covariances
  between them. Error propagation is done in matrix form, which jointly treats all
  samples and all isotopes simultaneously at every step of the data reduction process.
  Includes methods for regression of the time-resolved mass spectrometer signals to
  t=0 ('time zero') for both single- and multi-collector instruments, blank correction,
  mass fractionation correction, detector intercalibration, decay corrections, interference
  corrections, interpolation of the irradiation parameter between neutron fluence
  monitors, and (weighted mean) age calculation. All operations are performed on the
  logs of the ratios between the different argon isotopes so as to properly treat
  them as 'compositional data', sensu Aitchison [1986, The Statistics of Compositional
  Data, Chapman and Hall].
