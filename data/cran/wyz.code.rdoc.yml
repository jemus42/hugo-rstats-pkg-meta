version: 1.1.16
title: Wizardry Code Offensive Programming R Documentation
maintainer: Fabien Gelineau
description: |-
  Allows to generate on-demand or by batch, any R documentation file,
  whatever is kind, data, function, class or package. It populates
  documentation sections, either automatically or by considering
  your input. Input code could be standard R code or offensive programming code.
  Documentation content completeness depends on the type of code you use. With
  offensive programming code, expect generated documentation to be fully
  completed, from a format and content point of view. With some standard R
  code, you will have to activate post processing to fill-in any section that
  requires complements. Produced manual page validity is automatically tested
  against R documentation compliance rules. Documentation language
  proficiency, wording style, and phrasal adjustments remains your job.
