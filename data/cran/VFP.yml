  Variance function estimation for models proposed by W. Sadler in his variance function program
  ('VFP', <http://www.aacb.asn.au/resources/useful-tools/variance-function-program-v14>). Here, the idea is
  to fit multiple variance functions to a data set and consequently assess which function reflects
  the relationship 'Var ~ Mean' best. For 'in-vitro diagnostic' ('IVD') assays modeling this relationship
  is of great importance when individual test-results are used for defining follow-up treatment of patients.
