version: 1.0.3
title: Simulation Education
maintainer: Barry Lawson
description: |-
  Contains various functions to be used for simulation education,
  including simple Monte Carlo simulation functions, queueing simulation
  functions, variate generation functions capable of producing independent
  streams and antithetic variates, functions for illustrating random variate
  generation for various discrete and continuous distributions, and functions
  to compute time-persistent statistics.  Also contains two queueing data sets
  (one fabricated, one real-world) to facilitate input modeling.
