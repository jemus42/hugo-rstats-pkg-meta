title: Visualize the Results of Risk-of-Bias (ROB) Assessments
maintainer: Luke McGuinness
description: |-
  Helps users in quickly visualizing risk-of-bias
  assessments performed as part of a systematic review. It allows users to
  create weighted bar-plots of the distribution of risk-of-bias judgments
  within each bias domain, in addition to traffic-light plots of the
  specific domain-level judgments for each study. The resulting figures are
  of publication quality and are formatted according the risk-of-bias
  assessment tool use to perform the assessments. Currently, the supported
  tools are ROB2.0 (for randomized controlled trials; Sterne et al (2019)
  <doi:10.1136/bmj.l4898>), ROBINS-I (for non-randomised studies of
  interventions; Sterne et al (2016) <doi:10.1136/bmj.i4919>), and QUADAS-2
  (for diagnostic accuracy studies; Whiting et al (2011)
  <doi:10.7326/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009>).
