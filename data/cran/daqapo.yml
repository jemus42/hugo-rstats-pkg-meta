title: Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented Data
maintainer: Niels Martin
description: Provides a variety of methods to identify data quality issues in process-oriented
  data, which are useful to verify data quality in a process mining context. Builds
  on the class for activity logs implemented in the package 'bupaR'. Methods to identify
  data quality issues either consider each activity log entry independently (e.g.
  missing values, activity duration outliers,...), or focus on the relation amongst
  several activity log entries (e.g. batch registrations, violations of the expected
  activity order,...).
