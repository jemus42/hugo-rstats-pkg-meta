  Latent Class Item Response Theory (LC-IRT) Models under
  Within-Item Multidimensionality
maintainer: Francesco Bartolucci
description: Framework for the Item Response Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal
  polytomous outcomes under the assumption of within-item multidimensionality and
  discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow for missing responses
  and for different item parametrizations and are based on the Expectation-Maximization
  paradigm. Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be included in the
  new version together with possibility of constraints on all model parameters.
