title: Tools for Data Manipulation and Testing
maintainer: Jack O. Wasey
description: |-
  This is a set of simple utilities for various data
  manipulation and testing tasks.  The goal is to use core R tools well,
  without bringing in many dependencies. Main areas of interest are
  semi-automated data frame manipulation, such as converting factors in
  multiple binary indicator columns. There are testing functions which
  provide 'testthat' expectations to permute arguments to function
  calls. There are functions and data to test extreme numbers, dates,
  and bad input of various kinds which should allow testing failure and
  corner cases, which can be used for fuzzing your functions. The test
  suite has many examples of usage.
