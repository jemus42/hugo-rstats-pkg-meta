  Simulating Pollen Curves from Virtual Taxa with Different Life
  and Niche Traits
maintainer: Blas M. Benito
description: Tools to generate virtual environmental drivers with a given temporal
  autocorrelation, and to simulate pollen curves at annual resolution over millennial
  time-scales based on these drivers and virtual taxa with different life traits and
  niche features. It also provides the means to simulate quasi-realistic pollen-data
  conditions by applying simulated accumulation rates and given depth intervals between
  consecutive samples.
