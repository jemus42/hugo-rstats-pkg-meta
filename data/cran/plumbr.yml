title: Mutable and dynamic data models
maintainer: Michael Lawrence
description: |-
  The base R data.frame, like any vector, is
  copied upon modification. This behavior is at odds with
  that of GUIs and interactive graphics. To rectify this,
  plumbr provides a mutable, dynamic tabular data model.
  Models may be chained together to form the complex
  plumbing necessary for sophisticated graphical
  interfaces. Also included is a
  general framework for linking datasets; an typical
  use case would be a linked brush.
