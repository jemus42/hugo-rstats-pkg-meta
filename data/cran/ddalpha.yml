title: Depth-Based Classification and Calculation of Data Depth
maintainer: Oleksii Pokotylo
description: Contains procedures for depth-based supervised learning, which are entirely
  non-parametric, in particular the DDalpha-procedure (Lange, Mosler and Mozharovskyi,
  2014 <doi:10.1007/s00362-012-0488-4>). The training data sample is transformed by
  a statistical depth function to a compact low-dimensional space, where the final
  classification is done. It also offers an extension to functional data and routines
  for calculating certain notions of statistical depth functions. 50 multivariate
  and 5 functional classification problems are included. (Pokotylo, Mozharovskyi and
  Dyckerhoff, 2019 <doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i05>).
