title: Variant Set Enrichment
maintainer: Hansen He
description: Calculates the enrichment of associated variant set (AVS) for an array
  of genomic regions. The AVS is the collection of disjoint LD blocks computed from
  a list of disease associated SNPs and their linked (LD) SNPs. VSE generates a null
  distribution of matched random variant sets (MRVSs) from 1000 Genome Project Phase
  III data that are identical to AVS, LD block by block. It then computes the enrichment
  of AVS intersecting with user provided genomic features (e.g., histone marks or
  transcription factor binding sites) compared with the null distribution.
