  Trace Plots, Density Plots and Chain Comparisons for MCMC
  Samples
maintainer: Daniel Turek
description: |-
  Provides methods for examining posterior MCMC samples
  from a single chain using trace plots and density plots, and from
  multiple chains by comparing posterior medians and credible intervals
  from each chain.  These plotting functions have a variety of options,
  such as figure sizes, legends, parameters to plot, and saving plots to file.
  Functions interface with the NIMBLE software package, see
