title: Realized Relatedness Estimation and Simulation
maintainer: Bowen Wang
description: Functions for studying realized genetic relatedness between people. Users
  will be able to simulate inheritance patterns given pedigree structures, generate
  SNP marker data given inheritance patterns, and estimate realized relatedness between
  pairs of individuals using SNP marker data. See Wang (2017) <doi:10.1534/genetics.116.197004>.
