title: Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement
maintainer: Guillermo Aguilar
description: 'Conjoint measurement is a psychophysical procedure in which stimulus
  pairs are presented that vary along 2 or more dimensions and the observer is required
  to compare the stimuli along one of them.  This package contains functions to estimate
  the contribution of the n scales to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method
  under several hypotheses of how the perceptual dimensions interact. Reference: Knoblauch
  & Maloney (2012) "Modeling Psychophysical Data in R". <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-4475-6>.'
