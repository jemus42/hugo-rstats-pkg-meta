title: Bayesian Emulation of Computer Programs
maintainer: Robin K. S. Hankin
description: |2-

  Allows one to estimate the output of a computer program,
  as a function of the input parameters, without actually running it.
  The computer program is assumed to be a Gaussian process, whose
  parameters are estimated using Bayesian techniques that give a PDF of
  expected program output.  This PDF is conditional on a training set
  of runs, each consisting of a point in parameter space and the model
  output at that point.  The emphasis is on complex codes that take
  weeks or months to run, and that have a large number of undetermined
  input parameters; many climate prediction models fall into this
  class.  The emulator essentially determines Bayesian posterior
  estimates of the PDF of the output of a model, conditioned on results
  from previous runs and a user-specified prior linear model.  A vignette is
  provided and the help pages include examples.
