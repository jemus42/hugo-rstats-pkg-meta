title: Highly Adaptive Lasso Conditional Density Estimation
maintainer: Nima Hejazi
description: |-
  Conditional density estimation is a longstanding and challenging
  problem in statistical theory, and numerous proposals exist for optimally
  estimating such complex functions. Algorithms for nonparametric estimation
  of conditional densities based on a pooled hazard regression formulation and
  semiparametric estimation via conditional hazards modeling are implemented
  based on the highly adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression function for
  efficient estimation with fast convergence under mild assumptions. The
  pooled hazards formulation implemented was first described by DÃ­az and
  van der Laan (2011) <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356>.
