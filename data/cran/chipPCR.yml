title: Toolkit of Helper Functions to Pre-Process Amplification Data
maintainer: Stefan Roediger
description: A collection of functions to pre-process amplification curve data from
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or isothermal amplification reactions. Contains
  functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves, to detect both the start
  and end of an amplification reaction, several smoothers (e.g., LOWESS, moving average,
  cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay), a function to detect false positive amplification
  reactions and a function to determine the amplification efficiency. Quantification
  point (Cq) methods include the first (FDM) and second approximate derivative maximum
  (SDM) methods (calculated by a 5-point-stencil) and the cycle threshold method.
  Data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems (VideoScan HCU, capillary
  convective PCR (ccPCR)) and commercial systems are included. Amplification curves
  were generated by helicase dependent amplification (HDA), ccPCR or PCR. As detection
  system intercalating dyes (EvaGreen, SYBR Green) and hydrolysis probes (TaqMan)
  were used.
