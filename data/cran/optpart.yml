title: Optimal Partitioning of Similarity Relations
maintainer: David W. Roberts
description: |-
  Contains a set of algorithms for creating
  partitions and coverings of objects largely based on operations
  on (dis)similarity relations (or matrices). There are several
  iterative re-assignment algorithms optimizing different
  goodness-of-clustering criteria.  In addition, there are
  covering algorithms 'clique' which derives maximal cliques, and
  'maxpact' which creates a covering of maximally compact sets.
  Graphical analyses and conversion routines are also included.
