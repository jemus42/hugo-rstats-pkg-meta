description: |-
  Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization
  ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian optimization. It implements the Efficient
  Global Optimization Algorithm and is designed for both single- and multi-
  objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional
  parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr' provide dozens of regression
  learners to model the performance of the target algorithm with respect to
  the parameter settings. It provides many different infill criteria to guide
  the search process. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal,
  parallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated logging
  mechanisms, which is especially useful for teaching and understanding of
  algorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO' is implemented in a modular fashion, such that
  single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific
  use cases.
