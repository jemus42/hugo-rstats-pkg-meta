  An Implementation of the Typicality and Eccentricity Data
  Analysis Framework
maintainer: David Ciar
description: |-
  The typicality and eccentricity data analysis (TEDA) framework was
  put forward by Angelov (2013) <DOI:10.14313/JAMRIS_2-2014/16>. It has been further developed into multiple
  different techniques since, and provides a non-parametric way of determining how
  similar an observation, from a process that is not purely random, is to other
  observations generated by the process. This package provides code to use the
  batch and recursive TEDA methods that have been published.
