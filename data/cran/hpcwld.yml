  High Performance Cluster Models Based on Kiefer-Wolfowitz
  Recursion
maintainer: Alexander Rumyantsev
description: |-
  Probabilistic models describing the behavior
  of workload and queue on a High Performance Cluster and computing GRID
  under FIFO service discipline basing on modified Kiefer-Wolfowitz
  recursion. Also sample data for inter-arrival times, service times,
  number of cores per task and waiting times of HPC of Karelian
  Research Centre are included, measurements took place from 06/03/2009 to 02/30/2011.
  Functions provided to import/export workload traces in Standard Workload Format (swf).
  Stability condition of the model may be verified either exactly, or approximately.
