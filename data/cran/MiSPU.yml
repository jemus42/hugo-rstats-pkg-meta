title: Microbiome Based Sum of Powered Score (MiSPU) Tests
maintainer: Chong Wu
description: There is an increasing interest in investigating how the compositions
  of microbial communities are associated with human health and disease. In this package,
  we present a novel global testing method called aMiSPU, that is highly adaptive
  and thus high powered across various scenarios, alleviating the issue with the choice
  of a phylogenetic distance. Our simulations and real data analysis demonstrated
  that aMiSPU test was often more powerful than several competing methods while correctly
  controlling type I error rates.
