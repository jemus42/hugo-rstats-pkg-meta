title: Simulation of Bird Flight Range
maintainer: Brian Masinde
description: |-
  Functions for range estimation in birds based on Pennycuick (2008)
  and Pennycuick (1975), 'Flight' program which compliments Pennycuick (2008)
  requires manual entry of birds which can be tedious when there are thousands
  of birds to estimate. Implemented are two ODE methods discussed in Pennycuick (1975)
  and time-marching computation method "constant muscle mass" as in Pennycuick (1998).
