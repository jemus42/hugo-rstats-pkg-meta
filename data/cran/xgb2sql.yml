title: Convert Trained 'XGBoost' Model to SQL Query
maintainer: Chengjun Hou
description: |-
  This tool enables in-database scoring of 'XGBoost' models built in R, by translating trained model objects into SQL query.
  'XGBoost' <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html> provides parallel tree boosting (also known as gradient boosting machine, or GBM) algorithms
  in a highly efficient, flexible and portable way. GBM algorithm is introduced by Friedman (2001) <doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451>,
  and more details on 'XGBoost' can be found in Chen & Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785>.
