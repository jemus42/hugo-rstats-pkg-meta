description: |-
  Meyer and Held (2017) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw051> present an
  age-structured spatio-temporal model for infectious disease counts. The
  approach is illustrated in a case study on norovirus gastroenteritis in
  Berlin, 2011-2015, by age group, city district and week, using additional
  contact data from the POLYMOD survey. This package contains the data and
  code to reproduce the results from the paper, see 'demo("hhh4contacts")'.
