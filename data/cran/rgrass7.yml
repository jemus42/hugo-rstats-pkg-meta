maintainer: Roger Bivand
description: |-
  Interpreted interface between 'GRASS' 7 geographical
  information system and R, based on starting R from within the 'GRASS' 'GIS'
  environment, or running free-standing R in a temporary 'GRASS' location;
  the package provides facilities for using all 'GRASS' commands from the
  R command line. This package may not be used for 'GRASS' 6, for which
  'spgrass6' should be used.
