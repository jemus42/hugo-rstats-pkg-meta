maintainer: Mohmmadkarim Saeedghalati
description: |-
  It has tools for normalization of rank abundance
  distributions (RAD) to a desired number of ranks using MaxRank
  Normalization method.
  RADs are commonly used in biology/ecology and mathematically equivalent
  to complementary cumulative distributions (CCDFs) which are used in
  physics, linguistics and sociology and more generally in data science.
