title: Bayesian Bacterial Growth Curve Analysis in R
maintainer: Matthew Hartley
description: Babar is designed to use nested sampling (a Bayesian analysis technique)
  to compare possible models for bacterial growth curves, as well as extracting parameters.
  It allows model evidence and parameter likelihood values to be extracted, and also
  contains helper functions for comparing distributions as well as direct access to
  the underlying nested sampling code.
