  Nonparametric method for identifying discordant phylogenetic
  trees
maintainer: Grady Weyenberg
description: |-
  A non-parametric method for identifying potential
  outlying observations in a collection of phylogenetic trees based
  on the methods of Owen and Provan (2011). Such discordant trees
  may indicate problems with sequence annotation or tree
  reconstruction, or they may represent interesting biological
  phenomena, such as horizontal gene transfers.
