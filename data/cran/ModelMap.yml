description: Creates sophisticated models of training data and validates the models
  with an independent test set, cross validation, or Out Of Bag (OOB) predictions
  on the training data. Create graphs and tables of the model validation results.
  Applies these models to GIS .img files of predictors to create detailed prediction
  surfaces. Handles large predictor files for map making, by reading in the .img files
  in chunks, and output to the .txt file the prediction for each data chunk, before
  reading the next chunk of data.
