title: Bayesian Accrual Prediction
maintainer: Junhao Liu
description: Subject recruitment for medical research is challenging. Slow patient
  accrual leads to delay in research. Accrual monitoring during the process of recruitment
  is critical. Researchers need reliable tools to manage the accrual rate. We developed
  a Bayesian method that integrates researcher's experience on previous trials and
  data from the current study, providing reliable prediction on accrual rate for clinical
  studies. In this R package, we present functions for Bayesian accrual prediction
  which can be easily used by statisticians and clinical researchers.
