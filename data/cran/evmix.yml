  Extreme Value Mixture Modelling, Threshold Estimation and
  Boundary Corrected Kernel Density Estimation
maintainer: Carl Scarrott
description: |-
  The usual distribution functions, maximum likelihood inference and
  model diagnostics for univariate stationary extreme value mixture models
  are provided. Kernel density estimation including various boundary
  corrected kernel density estimation methods and a wide choice of kernels,
  with cross-validation likelihood based bandwidth estimator.
  Reasonable consistency with the base functions in the 'evd' package is
  provided, so that users can safely interchange most code.
