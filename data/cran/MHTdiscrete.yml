title: Multiple Hypotheses Testing for Discrete Data
maintainer: Yalin Zhu
description: |-
  A comprehensive tool for almost all existing multiple testing
  methods for discrete data. The package also provides some novel multiple testing
  procedures controlling FWER/FDR for discrete data. Given discrete p-values
  and their domains, the [method].p.adjust function returns adjusted p-values,
  which can be used to compare with the nominal significant level alpha and make
  decisions. For users' convenience, the functions also provide the output option
  for printing decision rules.
