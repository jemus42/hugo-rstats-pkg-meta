title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Package
maintainer: Jong Hee Park
description: |-
  Contains functions to perform Bayesian
  inference using posterior simulation for a number of
  statistical models. Most simulation is done in compiled C++
  written in the Scythe Statistical Library Version 1.0.3. All
  models return 'coda' mcmc objects that can then be summarized
  using the 'coda' package. Some useful
  utility functions such as density functions,
  pseudo-random number generators for statistical
  distributions, a general purpose Metropolis sampling algorithm,
  and tools for visualization are provided.
