  'AutoKeras' is an open source software library for Automated Machine
  Learning (AutoML). The ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily
  accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science
  or machine learning background. 'AutoKeras' provides functions to
  automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep
  learning models.
