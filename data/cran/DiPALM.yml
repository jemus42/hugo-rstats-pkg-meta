title: Differential Pattern Analysis via Linear Modeling
maintainer: Ryan C. Sartor
description: Individual gene expression patterns are encoded into a series of eigenvector
  patterns ('WGCNA' package). Using the framework of linear model-based differential
  expression comparisons ('limma' package), time-course expression patterns for genes
  in different conditions are compared and analyzed for significant pattern changes.
