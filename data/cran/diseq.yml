title: Estimation Methods for Markets in Disequilibrium
maintainer: Pantelis Karapanagiotis
description: |-
  Provides estimation methods for markets in equilibrium and
  disequilibrium. Specifically, it supports the estimation of an equilibrium and
  four disequilibrium models with both correlated and independent shocks.
  It also provides post-estimation analysis tools, such as aggregation and
  marginal effects calculations. The estimation methods are based on full
  information maximum likelihood techniques given in Maddala and Nelson (1974)
  <doi:10.2307/1914215>. They are implemented using the analytic derivative
  expressions calculated in Karapanagiotis (2020) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3525622>.
  The equilibrium estimation constitutes a special case of
  a system of simultaneous equations. The disequilibrium models, instead, replace
  the market clearing condition with a short side rule and
  allow for different specifications of price dynamics.
