description: |-
  Creating maps for statistical analysis such as proportional circles, chroropleth, typology and flows. Some functions use 'shiny' or 'leaflet' technologies for dynamism and interactivity.
  The great features are :
  - Create maps in a web environment where the parameters are modifiable on the fly ('shiny' and 'leaflet' technology).
  - Create interactive maps through zoom and pop-up ('leaflet' technology).
  - Create frozen maps with the possibility to add labels.
