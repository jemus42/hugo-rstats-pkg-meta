title: Sample Design, Drawing & Data Analysis Using Data Frames
maintainer: Michael Baldassaro
description: Determine sample sizes, draw samples, and conduct data analysis using
  data frames. It specifically enables you to determine simple random sample sizes,
  stratified sample sizes, and complex stratified sample sizes using a secondary variable
  such as population; draw simple random samples and stratified random samples from
  sampling data frames; determine which observations are missing from a random sample,
  missing by strata, duplicated within a dataset; and perform data analysis, including
  proportions, margins of error and upper and lower bounds for simple, stratified
  and cluster sample designs.
