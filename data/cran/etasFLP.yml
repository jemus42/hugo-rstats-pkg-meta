  for Earthquake Description
maintainer: Marcello Chiodi
description: 'Estimation of the components of an ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence)
  model for earthquake description. Non-parametric background seismicity can be estimated
  through FLP (Forward Likelihood Predictive). New version 2.0.0: covariates have
  been introduced to explain the effects of external factors on the induced seismicity;
  the parametrization has been changed; Chiodi, Adelfio (2017)<doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i03>.'
