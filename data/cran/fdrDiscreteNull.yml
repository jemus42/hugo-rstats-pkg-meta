  False Discovery Rate Procedures Under Discrete and Heterogeneous
  Null Distributions
maintainer: Xiongzhi Chen
description: 'It is known that current false discovery rate (FDR) procedures can be
  very conservative when applied to multiple testing in the discrete paradigm where
  p-values (and test statistics) have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions.
  This package implements more powerful weighted or adaptive FDR procedures for FDR
  control and estimation in the discrete paradigm. The package takes in the original
  data set rather than just the p-values in order to carry out the adjustments for
  discreteness and heterogeneity of p-value distributions. The package implements
  methods for two types of test statistics and their p-values: (a) binomial test on
  if two independent Poisson distributions have the same means, (b) Fisher''s exact
  test on if the conditional distribution is the same as the marginal distribution
  for two binomial distributions, or on if two independent binomial distributions
  have the same probabilities of success.'
