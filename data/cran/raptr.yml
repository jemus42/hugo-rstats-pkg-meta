title: Representative and Adequate Prioritization Toolkit in R
maintainer: Jeffrey O Hanson
description: |-
  Biodiversity is in crisis. The overarching aim of conservation
  is to preserve biodiversity patterns and processes. To this end, protected
  areas are established to buffer species and preserve biodiversity processes.
  But resources are limited and so protected areas must be cost-effective.
  This package contains tools to generate plans for protected areas
  (prioritizations), using spatially explicit targets for biodiversity
  patterns and processes. To obtain solutions in a feasible amount  of time,
  this package uses the commercial 'Gurobi' software package (obtained from
  <http://www.gurobi.com/>). For more information on using
  this package, see Hanson et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12862>.
