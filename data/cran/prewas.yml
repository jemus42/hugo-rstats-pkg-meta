  Data Pre-Processing for Bacterial Genome-Wide Association
  Studies
maintainer: Katie Saund
description: |-
  Standardize the pre-processing of genomic variants before
  performing a bacterial genome-wide association study (bGWAS). prewas creates
  a variant matrix (where each row is a variant, each column is a sample, and
  the entries are presence - 1 - or absence - 0 - of the variant) that can be
  used as input for bGWAS tools. When creating the binary variant matrix,
  prewas can perform 3 pre-processing steps including: dealing with
  multiallelic SNPs, (optional) dealing with SNPs in overlapping genes, and
  choosing a reference allele. prewas can output matrices for use with both
  SNP-based bGWAS and gene-based bGWAS. This method is described in Saund et
  al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/2019.12.20.873158>. prewas can also provide gene
  matrices for variants with specific SnpEff annotations (Cingolani et al.
  2012).
