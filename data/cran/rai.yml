title: Revisiting-Alpha-Investing for Polynomial Regression
maintainer: Kory D. Johnson
description: |-
  A modified implementation of stepwise regression that greedily searches
  the space of interactions among features in order to build polynomial regression models.
  Furthermore, the hypothesis tests conducted are valid-post model selection
  due to the use of a revisiting procedure that implements an alpha-investing
  rule. As a result, the set of rejected sequential hypotheses is proven to
  control the marginal false discover rate. When not searching for polynomials,
  the package provides a statistically valid algorithm
  to run and terminate stepwise regression. For more information, see
  Johnson, Stine, and Foster (2019) <arXiv:1510.06322>.
