title: Lasso, Group Lasso, and Sparse-Group Lasso for Mixed Models
maintainer: Jan Klosa
description: |-
  Proximal gradient descent solver for the operators lasso, group
  lasso, and sparse-group lasso. The implementation involves backtracking line
  search and warm starts. Input data needs to be clustered/grouped for the
  (sparse-)group lasso before calling these algorithms.
