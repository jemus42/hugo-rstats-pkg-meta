  Modeling Framework for Cellular Communities in their
  Environments
maintainer: Johannes Zimmermann
description: |-
  Can be used for simulation of organisms living in
  communities (Bauer and Zimmermann (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005544>).
  Each organism is represented individually and genome scale
  metabolic models determine the uptake and release of compounds. Biological
  processes such as movement, diffusion, chemotaxis and kinetics are available
  along with data analysis techniques.
