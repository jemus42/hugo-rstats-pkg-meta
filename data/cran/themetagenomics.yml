  Exploring Thematic Structure and Predicted Functionality of 16s
  rRNA Amplicon Data
maintainer: Stephen Woloszynek
description: |-
  A means to explore the structure of 16S rRNA surveys using a Structural
  Topic Model coupled with functional prediction. The user provides an abundance
  table, sample metadata, and taxonomy information, and themetagenomics infers
  associations between topics and sample features, as well as topics and predicted
  functional content. Functional prediction can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for
  Silva references) and PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes references). See
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0219235>.
