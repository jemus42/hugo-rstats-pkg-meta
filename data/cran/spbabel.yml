title: Convert Spatial Data Using Tidy Tables
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Tools to convert from specific formats to more general forms of
  spatial data. Using tables to store the actual entities present in spatial
  data provides flexibility, and the functions here deliberately
  minimize the level of interpretation applied, leaving that for specific
  applications. Includes support for simple features,  round-trip for 'Spatial' classes and long-form
  tables, analogous to 'ggplot2::fortify'. There is also a more 'normal form' representation
  that decomposes simple features and their kin to tables of objects, parts, and unique coordinates.
