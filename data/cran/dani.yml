maintainer: Matteo Quartagno
description: |-
  Provides tools to help the design and analysis of resilient non-inferiority trials. These include functions for sample size
  calculations and analyses of trials, with either a risk difference, risk ratio or arc-sine difference margin, and a function to run simulations to
  design a trial with the methods described in Quartagno et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.00241>.
