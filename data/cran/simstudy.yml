title: Simulation of Study Data
maintainer: Keith Goldfeld
description: |-
  Simulates data sets in order to explore modeling techniques or
  better understand data generating processes. The user specifies a set of
  relationships between covariates, and generates data based on these
  specifications. The final data sets can represent data from randomized
  control trials, repeated measure (longitudinal) designs, and cluster
  randomized trials. Missingness can be generated using various
  mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).
