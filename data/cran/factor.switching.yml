title: Post-Processing MCMC Outputs of Bayesian Factor Analytic Models
maintainer: Panagiotis Papastamoulis
description: A well known identifiability issue in factor analytic models is the invariance
  with respect to orthogonal transformations. This problem burdens the inference under
  a Bayesian setup, where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to generate
  samples from the posterior distribution. The package applies a series of rotation,
  sign and permutation transformations (Papastamoulis and Ntzoufras (2020) <arXiv:2004.05105>)
  into raw MCMC samples of factor loadings, which are provided by the user. The post-processed
  output is identifiable and can be used for MCMC inference on any parametric function
  of factor loadings. Comparison of multiple MCMC chains is also possible.
