title: Multinomial Sparse Group Lasso
maintainer: Niels Richard Hansen
description: |-
  Multinomial logistic regression with sparse group lasso
  penalty. Simultaneous feature selection and parameter
  estimation for classification. Suitable for high dimensional
  multiclass classification with many classes. The algorithm
  computes the sparse group lasso penalized maximum likelihood
  estimate. Use of parallel computing for cross validation and
  subsampling is supported through the 'foreach' and 'doParallel'
  packages. Development version is on GitHub, please report
  package issues on GitHub.
