  Functions for Computing Wavelet Filters, Wavelet Transforms and
  Multiresolution Analyses
maintainer: Eric Aldrich
description: |-
  Contains functions for computing and plotting
  discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and maximal overlap discrete
  wavelet transforms (MODWT), as well as their inverses.
  Additionally, it contains functionality for computing and
  plotting wavelet transform filters that are used in the above
  decompositions as well as multiresolution analyses.
