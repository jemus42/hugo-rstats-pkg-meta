title: Linked Emulator of a Coupled System of Simulators
maintainer: Ksenia N. Kyzyurova
description: 'Prototypes for construction of a Gaussian Stochastic Process emulator
  (GASP) of a computer model. This is done within the objective Bayesian implementation
  of the GASP. The package allows for construction of a linked GASP of the composite
  computer model. Computational implementation follows the mathematical exposition
  given in publication: Ksenia N. Kyzyurova, James O. Berger, Robert L. Wolpert. Coupling
  computer models through linking their statistical emulators. SIAM/ASA Journal on
  Uncertainty Quantification, 6(3): 1151-1171, (2018).<DOI:10.1137/17M1157702>.'
