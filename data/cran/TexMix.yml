  Supporting Functions and Data for Geo-Spatial Analytics Courses
  at UTDallas, Texas
maintainer: Michael Tiefelsdorf
description: |-
  A collection of functions and data - mostly from Texas - is provided.
  These are used as teaching tools for geo-spatial data analytics courses in the
  GISciences program at The University of Texas at Dallas. In addition, several
  vignettes illustrate geo-spatial data analytics practices, such as relative
  risk kernel density estimations based on food store locations within Dallas
  County or the identification of homogenous and spatially contiguous market areas
  built on socio-economic, demographic and infrastructure census information. The
  spatial resolution of the data-sets ranges from 1623 food store locations, over
  geo-referenced areal data of 258 Texan counties, to 529 census tracts as well
  as 1669 block groups in Dallas County. Cartographic, specialized regression and
  data handling functions are provided.
