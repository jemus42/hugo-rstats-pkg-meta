title: Representation of DET Curve with Confidence Intervals
maintainer: '"García-Ródenas, Álvaro"'
description: |2-

  Builds both ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and DET (Detection Error Tradeoff) curves from a set of predictors, which are the
  results of a binary classification system. The curves give a general vision of the performance of the classifier,
  and are useful for comparing performance of different systems.
