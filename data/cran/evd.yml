maintainer: Alec Stephenson
description: |-
  Extends simulation, distribution, quantile and density
  functions to univariate and multivariate parametric extreme

  calculate maximum likelihood estimates for univariate and
  bivariate maxima models, and for univariate and bivariate
  threshold models.
