title: Assertions for Checking the State of R
maintainer: Richard Cotton
description: |-
  A set of predicates and assertions for checking the state and
  capabilities of R, the operating system it is running on, and the IDE
  being used.  This is mainly for use by other package developers who
  want to include run-time testing features in their own packages.
  End-users will usually want to use assertive directly.
