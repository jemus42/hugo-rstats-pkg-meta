title: methods for analyzing introgression between divergent lineages
maintainer: C. Alex Buerkle
description: introgress provides functions for analyzing introgression<U+000a>of genotypes
  between divergent, hybridizing lineages, including<U+000a>estimating genomic clines
  from multi-locus genotype data and<U+000a>testing for deviations from neutral expectations.
  Functions are<U+000a>also provided for maximum likelihood estimation of molecular<U+000a>hybrid
  index and graphical analysis.
