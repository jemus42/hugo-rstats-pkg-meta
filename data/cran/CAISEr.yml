title: Comparison of Algorithms with Iterative Sample Size Estimation
maintainer: Felipe Campelo
description: |-
  Functions for performing experimental comparisons of algorithms
  using adequate sample sizes for power and accuracy. Implements the
  methodology originally presented in Campelo and Takahashi (2019)
  <doi:10.1007/s10732-018-9396-7>
  for the comparison of two algorithms, and later generalised in
  Campelo and Wanner (Submitted, 2019) <arxiv:1908.01720>.
