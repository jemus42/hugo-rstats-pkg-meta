  Power and Sample Size Calculation for Survival Analysis of
  Epidemiological Studies
maintainer: Weiliang Qiu
description: |-
  Functions to calculate power and
  sample size for testing main effect or interaction effect in
  the survival analysis of epidemiological studies
  (non-randomized studies), taking into account the
  correlation between the covariate of the
  interest and other covariates. Some calculations also take
  into account the competing risks and stratified analysis.
  This package also includes
  a set of functions to calculate power and sample size
  for testing main effect in the survival analysis of
  randomized clinical trials.
