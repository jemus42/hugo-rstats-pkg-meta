description: |-
  'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAST2' is a command-line tool.
  This package provides a way to call 'BEAST2'
  from an 'R' function call.
