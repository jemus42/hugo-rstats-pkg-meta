title: Tool for Clustering Genotypes in Haplotypes
maintainer: Gaston Quero
description: |-
  Function to  identify  haplotypes
  within QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). One haplotype is a combination of SNP
  (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) within the QTL. This function groups
  together all individuals of a population with the same haplotype.
  Each group contains individual with the same allele in each SNP,
  whether or not missing data. Thus, haplotyper groups individuals,
  that to be imputed, have a non-zero probability of having the same alleles
  in the entire sequence of SNP's. Moreover, haplotyper calculates such
  probability from relative frequencies.
