  CpG Filtering Method Based on Intra-Class Correlation
  Coefficients
maintainer: Jun Chen
description: Filter CpGs based on Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) when
  replicates are available. ICCs are calculated by fitting linear mixed effects models
  to all samples including the un-replicated samples. Including the large number of
  un-replicated samples improves ICC estimates dramatically. The method accommodates
  any replicate design.
