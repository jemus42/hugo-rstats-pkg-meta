title: Smooth Additive Quantile Regression Models
maintainer: Matteo Fasiolo
description: |-
  Smooth additive quantile regression models, fitted using
  the methods of Fasiolo et al. (2017) <arXiv:1707.03307>. Differently from
  'quantreg', the smoothing parameters are estimated automatically by marginal
  loss minimization, while the regression coefficients are estimated using either
  PIRLS or Newton algorithm. The learning rate is determined so that the Bayesian
  credible intervals of the estimated effects have approximately the correct
  coverage. The main function is qgam() which is similar to gam() in 'mgcv', but
  fits non-parametric quantile regression models.
