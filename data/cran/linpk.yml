title: Generate Concentration-Time Profiles from Linear PK Systems
maintainer: Benjamin Rich
description: |-
  Generate concentration-time profiles from linear pharmacokinetic
  (PK) systems, possibly with first-order absorption or zero-order infusion,
  possibly with one or more peripheral compartments, and possibly under
  steady-state conditions. Single or multiple doses may be specified. Secondary
  (derived) PK parameters (e.g. Cmax, Ctrough, AUC, Tmax, half-life, etc.) are
  computed.
