title: Linear, Quadratic, and Rational Optimization
maintainer: Robin Wellmann
description: Solver for linear, quadratic, and rational programs with linear, quadratic,
  and rational constraints. A unified interface to different R packages is provided.
  Optimization problems are transformed into equivalent formulations and solved by
  the respective package. For example, quadratic programming problems with linear,
  quadratic and rational constraints can be solved by augmented Lagrangian minimization
  using package 'alabama', or by sequential quadratic programming using solver 'slsqp'.  Alternatively,
  they can be reformulated as optimization problems with second order cone constraints
  and solved with package 'cccp'.
