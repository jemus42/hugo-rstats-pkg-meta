title: Synthetic Control Group Method for Comparative Case Studies
maintainer: Jens Hainmueller
description: Implements the synthetic control group method for comparative case studies
  as described in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller
  (2010, 2011, 2014). The synthetic control method allows for effect estimation in
  settings where a single unit (a state, country, firm, etc.) is exposed to an event
  or intervention. It provides a data-driven procedure to construct synthetic control
  units based on a weighted combination of comparison units that approximates the
  characteristics of the unit that is exposed to the intervention. A combination of
  comparison units often provides a better comparison for the unit exposed to the
  intervention than any comparison unit alone.
