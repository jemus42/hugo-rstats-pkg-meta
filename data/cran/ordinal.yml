title: Regression Models for Ordinal Data
maintainer: Rune Haubo Bojesen Christensen
description: |-
  Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known
  as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional
  hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/...
  models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted
  with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
  Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or
  partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be
  imposed on the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model
  methods are available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step,
  confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile methods and slice
  methods for visualizing the likelihood function and checking
  convergence.
