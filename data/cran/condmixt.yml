  Conditional Density Estimation with Neural Network Conditional
  Mixtures
maintainer: Julie Carreau
description: Neural network conditional mixtures are mixture models whose parameters
  are predicted by a neural network. The mixture model can thus change its parameters
  in response to changes in predictive covariates. Mixtures included are gaussian,
  log-normal and hybrid Pareto mixtures. The latter relies on the generalized Pareto
  distribution to account for the presence of large extreme events. The unconditional
  mixtures are also available.
