title: Community Estimation in G-Models via CORD
maintainer: Xi (Rossi) LUO
description: Partition data points (variables) into communities/clusters, similar
  to clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering.  This package
  implements a clustering algorithm based on a new metric CORD, defined for high dimensional
  parametric or semi-parametric distributions.  Read http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01939
  for more details.
