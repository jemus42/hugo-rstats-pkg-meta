description: Functions that compute rational approximations of fractional elliptic
  stochastic partial differential equations. The package also contains functions for
  common statistical usage of these approximations. The main reference for the methods
  is Bolin and Kirchner (2019) <arXiv:1711.04333>, which can be generated by the citation
