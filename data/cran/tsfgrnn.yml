title: Time Series Forecasting Using GRNN
maintainer: Francisco Martinez
description: |-
  A general regression neural network (GRNN) is a variant of a
  Radial Basis Function Network characterized by a fast single-pass learning.
  'tsfgrnn' allows you to forecast time series using a GRNN model Francisco
  Martinez et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_17> and Weizhong Yan
  (2012) <doi:10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2198074>. When the forecasting horizon
  is higher than 1, two multi-step ahead forecasting strategies can be used.
  The model built is autoregressive, that is, it is only based on the
  observations of the time series. You can consult and plot how the
  prediction was done. It is also possible to assess the forecasting accuracy
  of the model using rolling origin evaluation.
