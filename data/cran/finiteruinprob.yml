  Computation of the Probability of Ruin Within a Finite Time
  Horizon
maintainer: Benjamin Baumgartner
description: |-
  In the Cramér–Lundberg risk process perturbed by a Wiener
  process, this packages provides approximations to the probability of
  ruin within a finite time horizon.  Currently, there are three methods
  implemented: The first one uses saddlepoint approximation (two
  variants are provided), the second one uses importance sampling and
  the third one is based on the simulation of a dual process.  This last
  method is not very accurate and only given here for completeness.
