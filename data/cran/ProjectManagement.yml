title: Management of Deterministic and Stochastic Projects
maintainer: Juan Carlos Gonçalves Dosantos
description: Management problems of deterministic and stochastic projects. It obtains
  the duration of a project and the appropriate slack for each activity in a deterministic
  context. In addition it obtains a schedule of activities' time (Castro, Gómez &
  Tejada (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.orl.2007.01.003>). It also allows the management of
  resources. When the project is done, and the actual duration for each activity is
  known, then it can know how long the project is delayed and make a fair delivery
  of the delay between each activity (Bergantiños, Valencia-Toledo & Vidal-Puga (2018)
  <doi:10.1016/j.dam.2017.08.012>). In a stochastic context it can estimate the average
  duration of the project and plot the density of this duration, as well as, the density
  of the early and last times of the chosen activities. As in the deterministic case,
  it can make a distribution of the delay generated by observing the project already
  carried out.
