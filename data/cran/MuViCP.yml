  MultiClass Visualizable Classification using Combination of
  Projections
maintainer: Mohit Dayal
description: An ensemble classifier for multiclass classification. This is a novel
  classifier that natively works as an ensemble. It projects data on a large number
  of matrices, and uses very simple classifiers on each of these projections. The
  results are then combined, ideally via Dempster-Shafer Calculus.
