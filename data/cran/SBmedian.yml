title: Scalable Bayes with Median of Subset Posteriors
maintainer: Kisung You
description: Median-of-means is a generic yet powerful framework for scalable and
  robust estimation. A framework for Bayesian analysis is called M-posterior, which
  estimates a median of subset posterior measures. For general exposition to the topic,
  see the paper by Minsker (2015) <doi:10.3150/14-BEJ645>.
