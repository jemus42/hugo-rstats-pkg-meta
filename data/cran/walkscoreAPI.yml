title: Walk Score and Transit Score API
maintainer: John Whalen
description: |-
  A collection of functions to perform the Application
  Programming Interface (API) calls associated with the Walk
  Score website (www.walkscore.com) within the R environment.
  These functions can be used to query the Walk Score and Transit
  Score database for a wide variety of information using R
  scripts. This package includes the simple Walk Score and
  Transit Score API calls, which return the scores associated
  with an input location, as well as calls which return some data
  used to calculate the scores. These functions are especially
  useful for mass data collection and gathering Walk Score and
  Transit Score values for large lists of locations.
