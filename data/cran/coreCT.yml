  Programmatic Analysis of Sediment Cores Using Computed
  Tomography Imaging
maintainer: Troy D. Hill
description: 'Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a powerful tool for understanding
  the composition of sediment cores. This package streamlines and accelerates the
  analysis of CT data generated in the context of environmental science. Included
  are tools for processing raw DICOM images to characterize sediment composition (sand,
  peat, etc.). Root analyses are also enabled, including measures of external surface
  area and volumes for user-defined root size classes. For a detailed description
  of the application of computed tomography imaging for sediment characterization,
