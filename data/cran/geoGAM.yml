title: Select Sparse Geoadditive Models for Spatial Prediction
maintainer: Madlene Nussbaum
description: A model building procedure to build parsimonious geoadditive model from
  a large number of covariates. Continuous, binary and ordered categorical responses
  are supported. The model building is based on component wise gradient boosting with
  linear effects, smoothing splines and a smooth spatial surface to model spatial
  autocorrelation. The resulting covariate set after gradient boosting is further
  reduced through backward elimination and aggregation of factor levels. The package
  provides a model based bootstrap method to simulate prediction intervals for point
  predictions. A test data set of a soil mapping case study in Berne (Switzerland)
  is provided.
