description: |-
  The data analysis module for the Iterative Optimization Heuristics
  Profiler ('IOHprofiler'). This module provides statistical analysis methods for the
  benchmark data generated by optimization heuristics, which can be visualized through a
  web-based interface. The benchmark data is usually generated by the
  experimentation module, called 'IOHexperimenter'. 'IOHanalyzer' also supports
  the widely used 'COCO' (Comparing Continuous Optimisers) data format for benchmarking.
