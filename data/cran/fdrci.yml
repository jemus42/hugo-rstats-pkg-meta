title: Permutation-Based FDR Point and Confidence Interval Estimation
maintainer: Joshua Millstein
description: |-
  FDR functions for permutation-based estimators, including pi0 as well as FDR
  confidence intervals. The confidence intervals account for dependencies between
  tests by the incorporation of an overdispersion parameter, which is estimated
  from the permuted data.
