description: |-
  Read data in the 'MTConnect'<http://www.mtconnect.org/> standard.
  You can use the package to read data from historical 'MTConnect logs' along
  with the 'devices.xml' describing
  the device. The data is organised into a 'MTConnectDevice' S4 data structure
  and some convenience methods are also provided for basic read/view operations.
  The package also includes some functions for analysis of 'MTConnect' data. This includes
  functions to simulate data (primarily position data, feed rate and velocities)
  based on the G code and visualisation functions to compare the actual and simulated data.
