title: Risk Score Plot for Cox Regression
maintainer: Jing Zhang
description: |-
  The risk plot may be one of the most commonly used figures in
  tumor genetic data analysis. We can conclude the following two points:
  Comparing the prediction results of the model with the real survival situation
  to see whether the survival rate of the high-risk group is lower than that of the
  low-level group, and whether the survival time of the high-risk group is
  shorter than that of the low-risk group. The other is to compare the heat
  map and scatter plot to see the correlation between the predictors and the
  outcome.
