maintainer: Steven Andrew Culpepper
description: |-
  A function and vignettes for computing an intraclass correlation
  described in Aguinis & Culpepper (2015) <doi:10.1177/1094428114563618>.
  This package quantifies the share of variance in a dependent variable that
  is attributed to group heterogeneity in slopes.
