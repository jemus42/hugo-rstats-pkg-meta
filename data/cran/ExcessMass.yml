title: Excess Mass Calculation and Plots
maintainer: Marc-Daniel Mildenberger
description: |-
  Implementation of a function which calculates the empirical excess mass
  for given \eqn{\lambda} and given maximal number of modes (excessm()). Offering
  powerful plot features to visualize empirical excess mass (exmplot()). This
  includes the possibility of drawing several plots (with different maximal
  number of modes / cut off values) in a single graph.
