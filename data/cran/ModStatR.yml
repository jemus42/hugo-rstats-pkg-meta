description: 'Datasets and functions for the book "Mod√©lisation statistique par la
  pratique avec R", F. Bertrand, E. Claeys and M. Maumy-Bertrand (2019, ISBN:9782100793525,
  Dunod, Paris). The first chapter of the book is dedicated to an introduction to
  the R statistical software. The second chapter deals with correlation analysis:
  Pearson, Spearman and Kendall simple, multiple and partial correlation coefficients.
  New wrapper functions for permutation tests or bootstrap of matrices of correlation
  are provided with the package. The third chapter is dedicated to data exploration
  with factorial analyses (PCA, CA, MCA, MDA) and clustering. The fourth chapter is
  dedicated to regression analysis: fitting and model diagnostics are detailed. The
  exercises focus on covariance analysis, logistic regression, Poisson regression,
  two-way analysis of variance for fixed or random factors. Various example datasets
  are shipped with the package: for instance on pokemon, world of warcraft, house
  tasks or food nutrition analyses.'
