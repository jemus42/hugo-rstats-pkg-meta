title: Inference and Analysis for Generalized Quadratic Diffusions
maintainer: Etienne A.D. Pienaar
description: Tools for performing inference and analysis on a class of quadratic diffusion
  processes for both scalar and bivariate diffusion systems. For scalar diffusions,
  a module is provided for solving first passage time problems for both time-homogeneous
  and time-inhomogeneous GQDs.
