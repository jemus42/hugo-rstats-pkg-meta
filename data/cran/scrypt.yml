title: Key Derivation Functions for R Based on Scrypt
maintainer: Bob Jansen
description: |-
  Functions for working with the scrypt key derivation functions
  originally described by Colin Percival
  <https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf> and in Percival and Josefsson
  (2016) <doi:10.17487/RFC7914>. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation
  function created by Colin Percival. The algorithm was specifically designed
  to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by
  requiring large amounts of memory.
