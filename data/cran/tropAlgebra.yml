description: 'It includes functions like tropical addition, tropical multiplication
  for vectors and matrices. In tropical algebra, the tropical sum of two numbers is
  their minimum and the tropical product of two numbers is their ordinary sum. For
  more information see also I. Simon (1988) Recognizable sets with multiplicities
  in the tropical semi ring: Volume 324 Lecture Notes I Computer Science, pages 107-120
