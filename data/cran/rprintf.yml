title: Adaptive Builder for Formatted Strings
maintainer: Kun Ren
description: |-
  Provides a set of functions to facilitate building formatted strings
  under various replacement rules: C-style formatting, variable-based formatting,
  and number-based formatting. C-style formatting is basically identical to built-in
  function 'sprintf'. Variable-based formatting allows users to put variable names
  in a formatted string which will be replaced by variable values. Number-based
  formatting allows users to use index numbers to represent the corresponding
  argument value to appear in the string.
