  Adaptive Lasso for the Cox Regression with Interval Censored and
  Possibly Left Truncated Data
maintainer: Daewoo Pak
description: |-
  Penalized variable selection tools for the Cox
  proportional hazards model with interval censored and possibly
  left truncated data. It performs variable selection via
  penalized nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation with an
  adaptive lasso penalty. The optimal thresholding parameter can be
  searched by the package based on the profile Bayesian information
  criterion (BIC). The asymptotic validity of the methodology is
  established in Li et al. (2019 <doi:10.1177/0962280219856238>).
  The unpenalized nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation for
  interval censored and possibly left truncated data is also
  available.
