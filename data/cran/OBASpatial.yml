title: Objective Bayesian Analysis for Spatial Regression Models
maintainer: Alejandro Ordonez
description: It makes an objective Bayesian analysis of the spatial regression model
  using both the normal (NSR) and student-T (TSR) distributions. The functions provided
  give prior and posterior objective densities and allow default Bayesian estimation
  of the model regression parameters. Details can be found in Ordonez et al. (2020)
