version: 2.5.0
title: Multivariate Permutation Tests
maintainer: Livio Finos
description: |-
  It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation (and
  rotation) tests. Allowed tests: the t one and two samples, ANOVA, linear
  models, Chi Squared test, rank tests (i.e. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney,
  Kruskal-Wallis), Sign test and Mc Nemar. Test on Linear Models are
  performed also in presence of covariates (i.e. nuisance parameters).
  The permutation and the rotation methods to get the null distribution of
  the test statistics are available. It also implements methods for
  multiplicity control such as Westfall & Young minP procedure and Closed
  Testing (Marcus, 1976) and k-FWER. Moreover, it allows to test for fixed
  effects in mixed effects models.
