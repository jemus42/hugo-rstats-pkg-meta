  Estimation of the Proportion of Treatment Effect Explained by
  Surrogate Outcome Information
maintainer: Layla Parast
description: Provides functions to estimate the proportion of treatment effect on
  a censored primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a censored
  surrogate outcome/event. All methods are described in detail in "Assessing the Value
  of a Censored Surrogate Outcome" by Parast L, Tian L, and Cai T which is currently
  in press at Lifetime Data Analysis. The main functions are (1) R.q.event() which
  calculates the proportion of the treatment effect (the difference in restricted
  mean survival time at time t) explained by surrogate outcome information observed
  up to a selected landmark time, (2) R.t.estimate() which calculates the proportion
  of the treatment effect explained by primary outcome information only observed up
  to a selected landmark time, and (3) IV.event() which calculates the incremental
  value of the surrogate outcome information.
