title: Bayesian Inference for Zero-Inflated Count Models
maintainer: Markus Jochmann
description: |-
  Provides MCMC algorithms for the analysis of
  zero-inflated count models. The case of stochastic search
  variable selection (SVS) is also considered.  All MCMC samplers
  are coded in C++ for improved efficiency. A data set
  considering the demand for health care is provided.
