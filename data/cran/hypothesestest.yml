title: Confidence Intervals and Tests of Statistical Hypotheses
maintainer: Chengfeng Liu
description: |-
  Compute the confidence interval of the population mean
  with one sample or of the difference of population means of two
  samples from normal distributions or t-distributions.Compute
  the confidence interval of population variance with one sample
  or of the difference of population variances of two samples by
  chi-square tests.Test for population mean or the differences of
  two normal samples under normality with the given null
  hypothesis H0,which depends on the user,so that he can know if
  he can reject H0 or not at the significance level alpha.Do the
  chi-square tests with one or two samples which have multinomial
  distributions by using an approximate chi-square distribution
  when n is large enough.
