title: Conditional Random Sampling Sparse Matrices
maintainer: Nick Kunz
description: Conducts conditional random sampling on observed values in sparse matrices.
  Useful for training and test set splitting sparse matrices prior to model fitting
  in cross-validation procedures and estimating the predictive accuracy of data imputation
  methods, such as matrix factorization or singular value decomposition (SVD). Although
  designed for applications with sparse matrices, CRASSMAT can also be applied to
  complete matrices, as well as to those containing missing values.
