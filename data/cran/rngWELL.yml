title: Toolbox for WELL Random Number Generators
maintainer: Christophe Dutang
description: It is a dedicated package to WELL pseudo random generators, which were
  introduced in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period Generators Based on
  Linear Recurrences Modulo 2'', ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. But this
  package is not intended to be used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ to
  use the 'randtoolbox' package, which depends on this package.
