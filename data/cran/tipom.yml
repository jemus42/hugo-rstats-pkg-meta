title: Automated measure-based classification for flint tools
maintainer: Stefano Costa
description: |-
  TIPOM is based on a methodology that was developed in the
  1960s by Bernardino Bagolini. The basic idea is to use
  the three simple dimensions of length, width and thickness
  of each lithic artefact to classify them in discrete
  groups and infer their function.
