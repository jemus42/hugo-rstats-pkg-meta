  Interpretation of Point Forecasts as State-Dependent Quantiles
  and Expectiles
maintainer: Patrick Schmidt
description: |-
  Estimate specification models for the state-dependent level of an optimal quantile/expectile forecast.
  Wald Tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions are implemented. Plotting of the estimated specification model is possible.
  The package contains two data sets with forecasts and realizations: the daily accumulated precipitation at London, UK from the high-resolution model of the
  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, <https://www.ecmwf.int/>) and GDP growth Greenbook data by the US Federal Reserve.
  See Schmidt, Katzfuss and Gneiting (2015) <arXiv:1506.01917> for more details on the identification and estimation of a directive behind a point forecast.
