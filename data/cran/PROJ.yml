version: 0.1.6
title: Generic Coordinate System Transformations Using 'PROJ'
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  A wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software 'PROJ'
  that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system ('CRS')
  to another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.
  Version 6.0.0 or higher is required, earlier versions if available are not used
  leaving this package harmlessly non-functional. The intention is for this package
  to be used by user-packages such as 'reproj', and that the older 'PROJ.4' and version 5
  pathways be provided by the 'proj4' package. Separating this disruptive version
  change (from 4.0 and 5.0, to 6.0 and above) allows the use of existing and
  stable code in 'proj4' alongside the new idioms and requirements of modern 'PROJ'
  using this package. The 'PROJ' library is available from <https://proj.org/>.
