title: Variable Selection in Linear Mixed Models for SNP Data
maintainer: Sahir Bhatnagar
description: |-
  Fit penalized multivariable linear mixed models with a single
  random effect to control for population structure in genetic association
  studies. The goal is to simultaneously fit many genetic variants at the
  same time, in order to select markers that are independently associated
  with the response. Can also handle prior annotation information,
  for example, rare variants, in the form of variable weights. For more
  information, see the website below and the accompanying paper:
  Bhatnagar et al., "Simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for
  population structure in high dimensional prediction models", 2020,
