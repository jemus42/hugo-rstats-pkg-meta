title: Evaluation of Diversity in Nucleotide Libraries
maintainer: Eric Hare
description: |-
  Evaluation of diversity in peptide libraries, including NNN, NNB,
  NNK/S, and 20/20 schemes. Custom encoding schemes can also be defined.
  Metrics for evaluation include expected coverage, relative efficiency, and
  the functional diversity of the library. Peptide-level inclusion
  probabilities are computable for both the native and custom encoding
  schemes.
