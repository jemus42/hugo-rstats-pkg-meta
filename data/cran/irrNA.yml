  Coefficients of Interrater Reliability - Generalized for
  Randomly Incomplete Datasets
maintainer: Markus Brueckl
description: Provides coefficients of interrater reliability, that are generalized
  to cope with randomly incomplete (i.e. unbalanced) datasets without any imputation
  of missing values or any (row-wise or column-wise) omissions of actually available
  data. Applied to complete (balanced) datasets, these generalizations yield the same
  results as the common procedures, namely the Intraclass Correlation according to
  McGraw & Wong (1996) <doi:10.1037/1082-989X.1.1.30> and the Coefficient of Concordance
  according to Kendall & Babington Smith (1939) <doi:10.1214/aoms/1177732186>.
