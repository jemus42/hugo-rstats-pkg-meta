title: Work with Custom Distribution Functions
maintainer: Evgeni Chasnovski
description: |-
  Create, transform, and summarize custom random
  variables with distribution functions (analogues of 'p*()', 'd*()',
  'q*()', and 'r*()' functions from base R). Two types of distributions
  are supported: "discrete" (random variable has finite number of output
  values) and "continuous" (infinite number of values in the form of
  continuous random variable). Functions for distribution
  transformations and summaries are available. Implemented approaches
  often emphasize approximate and numerical solutions: all distributions
  assume finite support and finite values of density function; some
  methods implemented with simulation techniques.
