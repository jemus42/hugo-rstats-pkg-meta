title: Variance Dispersion Graphs and Fraction of Design Space Plots
maintainer: Pieter Schoonees
description: |-
  Facilities for constructing variance dispersion graphs, fraction-
  of-design-space plots and similar graphics for exploring the properties of
  experimental designs. The design region is explored via random sampling, which
  allows for more flexibility than traditional variance dispersion graphs. A
  formula interface is leveraged to provide access to complex model formulae.
  Graphics can be constructed simultaneously for multiple experimental designs
  and/or multiple model formulae. Instead of using pointwise optimization to
  find the minimum and maximum scaled prediction variance curves, which can be
  inaccurate and time consuming, this package uses quantile regression as an
  alternative.
