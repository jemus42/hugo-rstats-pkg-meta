title: Developing a core collections
maintainer: Marcin Studnicki
description: ccChooser can be used to developing and evaluation of core<U+000a>collections
  for germplasm collections (entire collection). This<U+000a>package used to develop
  a core collection for biological<U+000a>resources like genbanks. A core collection
  is defined as a<U+000a>sample of accessions that represent, with the lowest possible<U+000a>level
  of redundancy, the genetic diversity (the richness of<U+000a>gene or genotype categories)
  of the entire collection. The<U+000a>establishing a core collection that represents
  genetic<U+000a>diversity of the entire collection with minimum loss of its<U+000a>original
  diversity and minimum redundancies is an important<U+000a>problem for gene-banks
  curators and crop breeders. ccChooser<U+000a>establish core collection base on phenotypic
  data (agronomic,<U+000a>morphological, phenological).
