title: Integrative Visualizations of the Lipidome
maintainer: Tommi Suvitaival
description: |-
  Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'.
  The 'lipidomeR' provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic
  interpretation of the lipidome through publication-ready visualizations
  of regression models fitted on lipidomics data.
  With 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the lipidome
  can be interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where
  lipids are categorized by the lipid class and are presented on
  two-dimensional maps organized by the lipid size and level of saturation.
  This way, the 'lipidomeR' helps you gain an immediate understanding of
  the multivariate patterns in the lipidome already at first glance.
  You can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical associations, changes,
  differences, variation, or other lipid-specific values.
  The heatmaps are provided with publication-ready quality and the results
  behind the visualizations are based on rigorous statistical models.
