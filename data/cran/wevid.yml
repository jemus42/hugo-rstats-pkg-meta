  Quantifying Performance of a Binary Classifier Through Weight of
  Evidence
maintainer: Marco Colombo
description: The distributions of the weight of evidence (log Bayes factor) favouring
  case over noncase status in a test dataset (or test folds generated by cross-validation)
  can be used to quantify the performance of a diagnostic test (McKeigue (2019), <doi:10.1177/0962280218776989>).
  The package can be used with any test dataset on which you have observed case-control
  status and have computed prior and posterior probabilities of case status using
  a model learned on a training dataset. To quantify how the predictor will behave
  as a risk stratifier, the quantiles of the distributions of weight of evidence in
  cases and controls can be calculated and plotted.
