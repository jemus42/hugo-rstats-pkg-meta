title: Post-Selection Inference for Nonlinear Variable Selection
maintainer: Lotfi Slim
description: |-
  Different post-selection inference strategies for kernel
  selection, as described in "kernelPSI: a Post-Selection Inference Framework
  for Nonlinear Variable Selection", Slim et al., Proceedings of Machine
  Learning Research, 2019, <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/slim19a/slim19a.pdf>. The strategies rest upon quadratic kernel
  association scores to measure the association between a given kernel and an
  outcome of interest. The inference step tests for the joint effect of the
  selected kernels on the outcome. A fast constrained sampling algorithm is
  proposed to derive empirical p-values for the test statistics.
