title: Perform Tensor-on-Tensor Regression
maintainer: Eric F. Lock
description: Functions to predict one multi-way array (i.e., a tensor) from another
  multi-way array, using a low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization and a ridge
  (L_2) penalty [Lock, EF (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1401544>].  Also includes
  functions to sample from the Bayesian posterior of a tensor-on-tensor model.
