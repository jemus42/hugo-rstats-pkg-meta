  Estimation of Smooth Hazard Models for Interval-Censored Data
  with Applications to Survival and Illness-Death Models

description: |-
  Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible illness-
  death models with possibly interval-censored,left-truncated and right-censored
  data. Proportional intensities regression models can be specified to allow for
  covariates effects separately for each transition. We use either a parametric
  approach with Weibull baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with
  M-splines approximation of baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth
  estimates of the hazard functions. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum
  likelihood in the parametric approach and by penalized maximum likelihood in the
  semi-parametric approach.
