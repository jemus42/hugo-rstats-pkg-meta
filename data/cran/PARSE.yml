  Model-Based Clustering with Regularization Methods for
  High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Lulu Wang
description: Model-based clustering and identifying informative features based on
  regularization methods. The package includes three regularization methods - PAirwise
  Reciprocal fuSE (PARSE) penalty proposed by Wang, Zhou and Hoeting (2016), the adaptive
  L1 penalty (APL1) and the adaptive pairwise fusion penalty (APFP). Heatmaps are
