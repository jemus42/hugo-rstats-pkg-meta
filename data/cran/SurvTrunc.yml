description: 'Package performs Cox regression and survival distribution function estimation
  when the survival times are subject to double truncation. The estimation procedure
  for each method involves inverse probability weighting, where the weights correspond
  to the inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using the survival
  times and truncation times only. Both methods require that the survival and truncation
  times are quasi-independent. A test for checking this independence assumption is
  also included in this package. The functions available in this package for Cox regression,
  survival distribution function estimation, and testing independence under double
  truncation are based on the following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2017)

  Betensky (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001538>.'
