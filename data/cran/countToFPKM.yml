  Convert Counts to Fragments per Kilobase of Transcript per
  Million (FPKM)
maintainer: Ahmed Alhendi
description: 'Implements the algorithm described in Trapnell,C. et al. (2010) <doi:
  10.1038/nbt.1621>. This function takes read counts matrix of RNA-Seq data, feature
  lengths which can be retrieved using ''biomaRt'' package, and the mean fragment
  lengths which can be calculated using the ''CollectInsertSizeMetrics(Picard)'' tool.
  It then returns a matrix of FPKM normalised data by library size and feature effective
  length. It also provides the user with a quick and reliable function to generate
  FPKM heatmap plot of the highly variable features in RNA-Seq dataset.'
