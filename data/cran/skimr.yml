version: 2.1.1
title: Compact and Flexible Summaries of Data
maintainer: Elin Waring
description: |-
  A simple to use summary function that can be used with pipes
  and displays nicely in the console. The default summary statistics may
  be modified by the user as can the default formatting.  Support for
  data frames and vectors is included, and users can implement their own
  skim methods for specific object types as described in a vignette.
  Default summaries include support for inline spark graphs.
  Instructions for managing these on specific operating systems are
  given in the "Using skimr" vignette and the README.
