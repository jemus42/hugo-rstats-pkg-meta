title: Create Pivot Tables
maintainer: Christopher Bailiss
description: |-
  Create regular pivot tables with just a few lines of R.
  More complex pivot tables can also be created, e.g. pivot tables
  with irregular layouts, multiple calculations and/or derived
  calculations based on multiple data frames.  Pivot tables are
  constructed using R only and can be written to a range of
  output formats (plain text, 'HTML', 'Latex' and 'Excel'),
  including with styling/formatting.
