maintainer: Juergen Niedballa
description: Management of and data extraction from camera trap data in wildlife studies.
  The package provides a workflow for storing and sorting camera trap photos (and
  videos), tabulates records of species and individuals, and creates detection/non-detection
  matrices for occupancy and spatial capture-recapture analyses with great flexibility.
  In addition, it can visualise species activity data and provides simple mapping
  functions with GIS export.
