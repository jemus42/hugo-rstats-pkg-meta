  with Partially Overlapping Gene Sets
maintainer: Safiye Celik
description: |-
  A method to infer modules of co-expressed genes and the
  dependencies among the modules from multiple expression datasets that may
  contain different sets of genes. Please refer to: Extracting a low-dimensional
  description of multiple gene expression datasets reveals a potential driver for
