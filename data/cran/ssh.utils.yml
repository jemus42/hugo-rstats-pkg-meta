version: '1.0'
title: Local and remote system commands with output and error capture.
maintainer: Sergei Izrailev
description: |-
  This package provides utility functions for system command
  execution, both locally and remotely using ssh/scp. The command
  output is captured and provided to the caller. This functionality is
  intended to streamline calling shell commands from R, retrieving and
  using their output, while instrumenting the calls with appropriate
  error handling. NOTE: this first version is limited to unix with local
  and remote systems running bash as the default shell.
