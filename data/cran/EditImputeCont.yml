title: Simultaneous Edit-Imputation for Continuous Microdata
maintainer: Hang J. Kim
description: An integrated editing and imputation method for continuous microdata
  under linear constraints is implemented. It relies on a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical
  modeling approach as described in Kim et al. (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1040881>.
  In this approach, the joint distribution of the data is estimated by a flexible
  joint probability model. The generated edit-imputed data are guaranteed to satisfy
  all imposed edit rules, whose types include ratio edits, balance edits and range
  restrictions.
