title: Large, Sparse Optimal Matching with Refined Covariate Balance
maintainer: Samuel D. Pimentel
description: |-
  Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units
  and control units in observational studies.  Provisions are
  made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include
  fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are
  optimal in the sense that they are computed as solutions to
  network optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms.
