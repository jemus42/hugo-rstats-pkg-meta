title: Markov Model for the Online Multi-Channel Attribution Problem
maintainer: Davide Altomare
description: Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers
  and they want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success.
  This is called the online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains
  a probabilistic algorithm for the attribution problem. The model uses a k-order
  Markov representation to identify structural correlations in the customer journey
  data. The package also contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch, last-touch
  and linear-touch approach) for the same problem. The algorithms are implemented
  in C++.
