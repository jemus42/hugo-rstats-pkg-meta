  Bradley-Terry Model with Exponential Time Decayed Log-Likelihood
  and Adaptive Lasso
maintainer: Yunpeng Zhou
description: We apply Bradley-Terry Model to estimate teams' ability in paired comparison
  data. Exponential Decayed Log-likelihood function is applied for dynamic approximation
  of current rankings and Lasso penalty is applied for variance reduction and grouping.
  The main algorithm applies the Augmented Lagrangian Method described by Masarotto
  and Varin (2012) <doi:10.1214/12-AOAS581>.
