  U.S. State Cartogram Heatmaps in R; an Alternative to Choropleth
  Maps for USA States
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  Cartogram heatmaps are an alternative to choropleth maps for USA States
  and are based on work by the Washington Post graphics department in their report
  on "The states most threatened by trade". "State bins" preserve as much of the
  geographic placement of the states as possible but has the look and feel of a
  traditional heatmap. Functions are provided that allow for use of a binned,
  discrete scale, a continuous scale or manually specified colors depending on
  what is needed for the underlying data.
