title: Separate a Data Frame by Normalization
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Separate a data frame in two based on key columns. The function
  unjoin() provides an inside-out version of a nested data frame. This is used
  to identify duplication and normalize it (in the database sense) by linking
  two tables with the redundancy removed. This is a basic requirement for
  detecting topology within spatial structures that has motivated the need for
  this package as a building block for workflows within more applied projects.
