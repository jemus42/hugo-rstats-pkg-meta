title: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae
maintainer: Simon Trimborn
description: Several Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) tests for Copulae are provided. A new hybrid
  test, Zhang et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.017> is implemented which
  supports all of the individual tests in the package, e.g. Genest et al. (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2007.10.005>.
  Estimation methods for the margins are provided and all the tests support parameter
  estimation and predefined values. The parameters are estimated by pseudo maximum
  likelihood but if it fails the estimation switches automatically to inversion of
  Kendall's tau. For reproducibility of results, the functions support the definition
  of seeds. Also all the tests support automatized parallelization of the bootstrapping
  tasks. The package provides an interface to perform new GoF tests by submitting
  the test statistic.
