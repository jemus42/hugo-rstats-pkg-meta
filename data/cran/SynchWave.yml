version: 1.1.1
title: Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform
maintainer: Donghoh Kim
description: 'This package carries out synchrosqueezed wavelet transform. The package
  is a translation of MATLAB Synchrosqueezing Toolbox, version 1.1 originally developed
  by Eugene Brevdo (2012). The C code for curve_ext was authored by Jianfeng Lu, and
  translated to Fortran by Dongik Jang. Synchrosqueezing is based on the papers: [1]
  Daubechies, I., Lu, J. and Wu, H. T. (2011) Synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms:
  An empirical mode decomposition-like tool. Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis,
  30. 243-261. [2] Thakur, G., Brevdo, E., Fukar, N. S. and Wu, H-T. (2013) The Synchrosqueezing
  algorithm for time-varying spectral analysis: Robustness properties and new paleoclimate
  applications. Signal Processing, 93, 1079-1094.'
