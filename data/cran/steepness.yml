title: Testing Steepness of Dominance Hierarchies
maintainer: David Leiva
description: steepness is a package that computes steepness as a<U+000a>property of
  dominance hierarchies. Steepness is defined as the<U+000a>absolute slope of the
  straight line fitted to the normalized<U+000a>David's scores. The normalized David's
  scores can be obtained<U+000a>on the basis of dyadic dominance indices corrected
  for chance<U+000a>or by means of proportions of wins. Given an observed<U+000a>sociomatrix,
  it computes hierarchy's steepness and estimates<U+000a>statistical significance
  by means of a randomization test.
