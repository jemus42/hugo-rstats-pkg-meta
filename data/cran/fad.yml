title: Factor Analysis for Data
maintainer: Somak Dutta
description: |-
  Compute maximum likelihood estimators of parameters in a Gaussian factor model using
  the the matrix-free methodology described in Dai et al. (2019) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1704296>.
  In contrast to the factanal() function from 'stats' package, fad() can handle high-dimensional datasets where
  number of variables exceed the sample size and is also substantially faster than the EM algorithms.
