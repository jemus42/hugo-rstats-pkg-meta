title: Harvest the Classification Tree
maintainer: Bingyuan Liu
description: Aimed at applying the Harvest classification tree algorithm, modified
  algorithm of classic classification tree.The harvested tree has advantage of deleting
  redundant rules in trees, leading to a simplify and more efficient tree model.It
  was firstly used in drug discovery field, but it also performs well in other kinds
  of data, especially when the region of a class is disconnected. This package also
  improves the basic harvest classification tree algorithm by extending the field
  of data of algorithm to both continuous and categorical variables. To learn more
  about the harvest classification tree algorithm, you can go to http://www.stat.ubc.ca/Research/TechReports/techreports/220.pdf
  for more information.
