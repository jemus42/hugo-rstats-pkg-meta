  Q-Kernel-Based and Conditionally Negative Definite Kernel-Based
  Machine Learning Tools
maintainer: Yusen Zhang
description: |-
  Nonlinear machine learning tool for classification, clustering
  and dimensionality reduction. It integrates 12 q-kernel functions and
  15 conditional negative definite kernel functions and includes the
  q-kernel and conditional negative definite kernel version of
  density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,
  spectral clustering, generalized discriminant analysis, principal
  component analysis, multidimensional scaling, locally linear embedding,
  sammon's mapping and t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
