title: Set of Tools to Compute Various Climate Indices
maintainer: Nuria Perez-Zanon
description: |-
  Set of tools to compute metrics and indices for climate analysis.
  The package provides functions to compute extreme indices, evaluate the
  agreement between models and combine theses models into an ensemble. Multi-model
  time series of climate indices can be computed either after averaging the 2-D
  fields from different models provided they share a common grid or by combining
  time series computed on the model native grid. Indices can be assigned weights
  and/or combined to construct new indices.
