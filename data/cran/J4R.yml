title: Create 'Java' Objects and Execute 'Java' Methods
maintainer: Mathieu Fortin
description: |-
  Makes it possible to create 'Java' objects and to execute 'Java' methods from the 'R' environment.
  The 'Java' Virtual Machine is handled by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server
  through a socket connection from the 'R' environment. Calls to 'Java' methods allow for
  vectors so that a particular method is iteratively run on each element of the vector. A
  score algorithm also makes the calls to 'Java' methods less restrictive. The gateway server
  relies on the runnable 'Java' library 'j4r.jar'. This library is licensed under the LGPL-3. Its
  sources are included in this package.
