description: |-
  Multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) (Giera≈Çtowski et al.,
  2012)<DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.85.021915> is a time series analysis method,
  designed to describe scaling properties of fluctuations within the signal
  analyzed. The main result of this procedure is the so called Hurst surface
  h(q,s) , which is a dependence of the local Hurst exponent h (fluctuation
  scaling exponent) on the multifractal parameter q and the scale of observation s
  (data window width).
