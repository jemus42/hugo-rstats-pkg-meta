  Training Multi-Layer Neural Network for Softmax Regression and
  Classification
maintainer: Xichen Ding
description: Implementation of 'softmax' regression and classification models with
  multiple layer neural network. It can be used for many tasks like word embedding
  based document classification, 'MNIST' dataset handwritten digit recognition and
  so on. Multiple optimization algorithm including 'SGD', 'Adagrad', 'RMSprop', 'Moment',
  'NAG', etc are also provided.
