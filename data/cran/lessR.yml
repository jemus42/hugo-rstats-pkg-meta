title: Less Code, More Results
maintainer: David W. Gerbing
description: Each function accomplishes the work of several or more standard R functions.
  For example, two function calls, Read() and CountAll(), read the data and generate
  summary statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus histograms and bar
  charts as appropriate. Other functions provide for descriptive statistics, a comprehensive
  regression analysis, analysis of variance and t-test, plotting including the introduced
  here Violin/Box/Scatter plot for a numerical variable, bar chart, histogram, box
  plot, density curves, calibrated power curve, reading multiple data formats with
  the same function call, variable labels, color themes, Trellis graphics and a built-in
  help system. Also includes a confirmatory factor analysis of multiple indicator
  measurement models, pedagogical routines for data simulation such as for the Central
  Limit Theorem, and generation and rendering of R markdown instructions for interpretative
  output.
