title: Tools for the Analysis of Animal Track Data
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Functions for accessing and manipulating spatial data for animal
  tracking, with straightforward coercion from and to other formats. Filter
  for speed and create time spent maps from animal track data. There are
  coercion methods to convert between 'trip' and 'ltraj' from 'adehabitatLT',
  and between 'trip' and 'psp' and 'ppp' from 'spatstat'. Trip objects
  can be created from raw or grouped data frames, and from types in the 'sp',
  'sf', 'amt', 'trackeR', 'mousetrap', and other packages.
