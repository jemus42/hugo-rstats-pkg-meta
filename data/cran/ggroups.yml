title: Pedigree and Genetic Groups
maintainer: Mohammad Ali Nilforooshan
description: Calculates additive and dominance genetic relationship matrices and their
  inverses, in matrix and tabular-sparse formats. It includes functions for checking
  and processing pedigree, as well as functions to calculate the matrix of genetic
  group contributions (Q), and adding those contributions to the genetic merit of
  animals (Quaas (1988) <doi:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79691-5>). Calculation of Q
  is computationally extensive. There are computationally optimized functions to calculate
  Q.
