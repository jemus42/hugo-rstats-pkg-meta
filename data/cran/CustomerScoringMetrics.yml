  Evaluation Metrics for Customer Scoring Models Depending on
  Binary Classifiers
maintainer: Koen W. De Bock
description: 'Functions for evaluating and visualizing predictive model performance
  (specifically: binary classifiers) in the field of customer scoring. These metrics
  include lift, lift index, gain percentage, top-decile lift, F1-score, expected misclassification
  cost and absolute misclassification cost. See Berry & Linoff (2004, ISBN:0-471-47064-3),
  Witten and Frank (2005, 0-12-088407-0) and Blattberg, Kim & Neslin (2008, ISBN:978–0–387–72578–9)
  for details. Visualization functions are included for lift charts and gain percentage
  charts. All metrics that require class predictions offer the possibility to dynamically
  determine cutoff values for transforming real-valued probability predictions into
  class predictions.'
