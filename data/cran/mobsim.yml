description: |-
  Tools for the simulation, analysis and sampling of spatial
  biodiversity data (May et al. 2017) <doi:10.1101/209502>.
  In the simulation tools user define the numbers of
  species and individuals, the species abundance distribution and species
  aggregation. Functions for analysis include species rarefaction
  and accumulation curves, species-area relationships and the distance
  decay of similarity.
