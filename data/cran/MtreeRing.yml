  A Shiny Application for Automatic Measurements of Tree-Ring
  Widths on Digital Images
maintainer: Jingning Shi
description: Use morphological image processing and edge detection algorithms to automatically
  measure tree ring widths on digital images. Users can also manually mark tree rings
  on species with complex anatomical structures. The arcs of inner-rings and angles
  of successive inclined ring boundaries are used to correct ring-width series. The
  package provides a Shiny-based application, allowing R beginners to easily analyze
  tree ring images and export ring-width series in standard file formats.
