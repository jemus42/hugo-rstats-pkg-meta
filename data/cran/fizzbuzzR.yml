title: Fizz Buzz Implementation
maintainer: Ansgar Wenzel
description: |-
  An implementation of the Fizz Buzz algorithm, as defined e.g. in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz>.
  It provides the standard algorithm with 3 replaced by Fizz and 5 replaced by Buzz, with the option of specifying start
  and end numbers, step size and the numbers being replaced by fizz and buzz, respectively. This package gives
  interviewers the optional answer of "I use fizzbuzzR::fizzbuzz()" when interviewing rather than having to write an algorithm
  themselves.
