title: Read Rectangular Text Data
maintainer: Jim Hester
description: |-
  The goal of 'readr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to read
  rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf'). It is designed to flexibly
  parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when
  data unexpectedly changes.
