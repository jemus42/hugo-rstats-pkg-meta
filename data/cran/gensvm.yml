title: A Generalized Multiclass Support Vector Machine
maintainer: Gertjan van den Burg
description: |-
  The GenSVM classifier is a generalized multiclass support vector
  machine (SVM). This classifier aims to find decision boundaries that
  separate the classes with as wide a margin as possible. In GenSVM, the
  loss function is very flexible in the way that misclassifications are
  penalized.  This allows the user to tune the classifier to the dataset
  at hand and potentially obtain higher classification accuracy than
  alternative multiclass SVMs.  Moreover, this flexibility means that
  GenSVM has a number of other multiclass SVMs as special cases. One of
  the other advantages of GenSVM is that it is trained in the primal
  space, allowing the use of warm starts during optimization.  This
  means that for common tasks such as cross validation or repeated model
  fitting, GenSVM can be trained very quickly. Based on: G.J.J. van den
