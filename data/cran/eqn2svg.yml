title: Create an SVG-Based Mathematical Formula
maintainer: Richard Iannone
description: |-
  If you have a mathematical formula and the need to have that
  formula in the form of scalable vector graphics (SVG), you'll be
  delighted by what 'eqn2svg' will let you do. The incoming LaTeX math formula
  will be nicely converted to SVG tags. And you can use that code wherever
  SVGs are accepted.
