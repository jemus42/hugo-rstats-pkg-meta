  'Simulates Univariate and Semi-Competing Risks Data Given
  Covariates and Piecewise Exponential Baseline Hazards'
maintainer: Andrew G Chapple
description: Contains two functions for simulating survival data from piecewise exponential
  hazards with a proportional hazards adjustment for covariates. The first function
  SimUNIVPiecewise simulates univariate survival data based on a piecewise exponential
  hazard, covariate matrix and true regression vector. The second function SimSCRPiecewise
  semi-competing risks data based on three piecewise exponential hazards, three true
  regression vectors and three matrices of patient covariates (which can be different
  or the same). This simulates from the Semi-Markov model of Lee et al (2015) given
  patient covariates, regression parameters, patient frailties and baseline hazard
  functions.
