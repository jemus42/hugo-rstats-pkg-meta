title: Evaluation of Genotyping Error in Genotype-by-Sequencing Data
maintainer: Eric C. Anderson
description: This is a small, lightweight package that lets users investigate the
  distribution of genotypes in genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data where they expect
  (by and large) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, in order to assess rates of genotyping
  errors and the dependence of those rates on read depth.  It implements a Markov
  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using 'Rcpp' to compute a Bayesian estimate of
  what we call the heterozygote miscall rate for restriction-associated digest (RAD)
  sequencing data and other types of reduced representation GBS data. It also provides
  functions to generate plots of expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some
  background on these topics can be found in a recent paper "Recent advances in conservation
  and population genomics data analysis" by Hendricks et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/eva.12659>,
  and another paper describing the MCMC approach is in preparation with Gordon Luikart
  and Thierry Gosselin.
