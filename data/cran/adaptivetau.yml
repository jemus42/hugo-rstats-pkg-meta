title: Tau-Leaping Stochastic Simulation
maintainer: Philip Johnson
description: |-
  Implements adaptive tau leaping to approximate the
  trajectory of a continuous-time stochastic process as
  described by Cao et al. (2007) The Journal of Chemical Physics
  <doi:10.1063/1.2745299> (aka. the Gillespie stochastic
  simulation algorithm).  This package is based upon work
  supported by NSF DBI-0906041 and NIH K99-GM104158 to Philip
  Johnson and NIH R01-AI049334 to Rustom Antia.
