title: K-Sample Rank Tests and their Combinations
maintainer: Fritz Scholz
description: |-
  Compares k samples using the Anderson-Darling test, Kruskal-Wallis type tests
  with different rank score criteria, Steel's multiple comparison test, and the
  Jonckheere-Terpstra (JT) test. It computes asymptotic, simulated or (limited) exact
  P-values, all valid under randomization, with or without ties, or conditionally
  under random sampling from populations, given the observed tie pattern.  Except for
  Steel's test and the JT test it also combines these tests across several blocks of
  samples.  Also analyzed are 2 x t contingency tables and their blocked combinations
  using the Kruskal-Wallis criterion.  Steel's test is inverted to provide simultaneous
  confidence bounds for shift parameters.  A plotting function compares tail probabilities
  obtained under asymptotic approximation with those obtained via simulation or exact
  calculations.
