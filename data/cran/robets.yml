title: Forecasting Time Series with Robust Exponential Smoothing
maintainer: Ruben Crevits
description: We provide an outlier robust alternative of the function ets() in the
  'forecast' package of Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v027.i03>.
  For each method of a class of exponential smoothing variants we made a robust alternative.
  The class includes methods with a damped trend and/or seasonal components. The robust
  method is developed by robustifying every aspect of the original exponential smoothing
  variant. We provide robust forecasting equations, robust initial values, robust
  smoothing parameter estimation and a robust information criterion. The method is
  described in more detail in Crevits and Croux (2016) <DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.11791.18080>.
