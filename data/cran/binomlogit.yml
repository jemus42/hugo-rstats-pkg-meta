title: Efficient MCMC for Binomial Logit Models
maintainer: Agnes Fussl
description: 'The R package contains different MCMC schemes to estimate the regression
  coefficients of a binomial (or binary) logit model within a Bayesian framework:
  a data-augmented independence MH-sampler, an auxiliary mixture sampler and a hybrid
  auxiliary mixture (HAM) sampler. All sampling procedures are based on algorithms
  using data augmentation, where the regression coefficients are estimated by rewriting
  the logit model as a latent variable model called difference random utility model
  (dRUM).'
