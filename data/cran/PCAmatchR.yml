title: Match Cases to Controls Based on Genotype Principal Components
maintainer: Derek W. Brown
description: |-
  Matches cases to controls based on genotype principle components (PC).
  In order to produce better results, matches are based on the weighted
  distance of PCs where the weights are equal to the % variance explained
  by that PC. A weighted Mahalanobis distance metric (Kidd et al. (1987)
  <DOI:10.1016/0031-3203(87)90066-5>) is used to determine matches.
