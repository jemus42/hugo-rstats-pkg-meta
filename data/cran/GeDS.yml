title: Geometrically Designed Spline Regression
maintainer: Andrea Lattuada
description: |-
  Geometrically Designed Spline ('GeDS') Regression is a non-parametric geometrically
  motivated method for fitting variable knots spline predictor models in one or two independent
  variables, in the context of generalized (non-)linear models. 'GeDS' estimates the number and
  position of the knots and the order of the spline, assuming the response variable has a
  distribution from the exponential family. A description of the method can be found in
  Kaishev et al. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s00180-015-0621-7> and Dimitrova et al. (2017) <https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/18460>.
