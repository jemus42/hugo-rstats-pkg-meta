title: Frechet Random Forests
maintainer: Louis Capitaine
description: Random forests are a statistical learning method widely used in many
  areas of scientific research essentially for its ability to learn complex relationships
  between input and output variables and also its capacity to handle high-dimensional
  data. However, current random forests approaches are not flexible enough to handle
  longitudinal heterogeneous data.  In this package, we introduce Fréchet trees and
  Fréchet random forests, which allow to manage data for which input and output variables
  are curves. To this end, a new way of splitting the nodes of trees is introduced
  and the prediction procedures of trees and forests are generalized.
