version: 0.1.0
title: Spatial Entropy Measures
maintainer: L. Altieri
description: The heterogeneity of spatial data presenting a finite number of categories
  can be measured via computation of spatial entropy. Functions are available for
  the computation of the main entropy and spatial entropy measures in the literature.
  They include the traditional version of Shannon's entropy, Batty's spatial entropy,
  O'Neill's entropy, Li and Reynolds' contagion index, Karlstrom and Ceccato's entropy,
  Leibovici's entropy, Parresol and Edwards' entropy and Altieri's entropy. References
  for all measures can be found under the topic 'SpatEntropy'. The package is able
  to work with lattice and point data.
