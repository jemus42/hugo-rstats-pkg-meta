title: Optimal Experimental Designs for Accelerated Life Testing
maintainer: Kangwon Seo
description: |-
  Creates the optimal (D, U and I) designs for the accelerated life
  testing with right censoring or interval censoring. It uses generalized
  linear model (GLM) approach to derive the asymptotic variance-covariance
  matrix of regression coefficients. The failure time distribution is assumed
  to follow Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter and log-linear
  link functions are used to model the relationship between failure time
  parameters and stress variables. The acceleration model may have multiple
  stress factors, although most ALTs involve only two or less stress factors.
  ALTopt package also provides several plotting functions including contour plot,
  Fraction of Use Space (FUS) plot and Variance Dispersion graphs of Use Space
  (VDUS) plot. For more details, see Seo and Pan (2015) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2015-029>.
