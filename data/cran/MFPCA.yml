  Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis for Data
  Observed on Different Dimensional Domains
maintainer: Clara Happ-Kurz
description: |-
  Calculate a multivariate functional principal component analysis
  for data observed on different dimensional domains. The estimation algorithm
  relies on univariate basis expansions for each element of the multivariate
  functional data  (Happ & Greven, 2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1273115>.
  Multivariate and univariate functional data objects are
  represented by S4 classes for this type of data implemented in the package
  'funData'. For more details on the general concepts of both packages and a case
  study, see Happ-Kurz (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v093.i05>.
