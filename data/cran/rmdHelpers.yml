title: Helper Functions for Rmd Documents
maintainer: Mark Peterson
description: A series of functions to aid in repeated tasks for Rmd documents. All
  details are to my personal preference, though I am happy to add flexibility if there
  are use cases I am missing. I will continue updating with new functions as I add
  utility functions for myself.
