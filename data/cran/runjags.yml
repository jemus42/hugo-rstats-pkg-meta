  Interface Utilities, Model Templates, Parallel Computing Methods
  and Additional Distributions for MCMC Models in JAGS
maintainer: Matthew Denwood
description: |-
  User-friendly interface utilities for MCMC models via
  Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS), facilitating the use of parallel
  (or distributed) processors for multiple chains, automated control
  of convergence and sample length diagnostics, and evaluation of the
  performance of a model using drop-k validation or against simulated
  data. Template model specifications can be generated using a standard
  lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the
  BUGS syntax.  A JAGS extension module provides additional distributions
  including the Pareto family of distributions, the DuMouchel prior and
  the half-Cauchy prior.
