  Tools to run system processes in the background.
  It can check if a background process is running; wait on a background
  process to finish; get the exit status of finished processes; kill
  background processes. It can read the standard output and error of
  the processes, using non-blocking connections. 'processx' can poll
  a process for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can also
  poll several processes at once.
