title: Lightweight Reproducible Reporting
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Order, create and store reports from R.  By defining a
  lightweight interface around the inputs and outputs of an
  analysis, a lot of the repetitive work for reproducible research
  can be automated.  We define a simple format for organising and
  describing work that facilitates collaborative reproducible
  research and acknowledges that all analyses are run multiple
  times over their lifespans.
