title: Hyperparameter Search for Gradient Boosted Trees
maintainer: Waley W. J. Liang
description: |-
  An implementation of hyperparameter optimization for Gradient
  Boosted Trees on binary classification and regression problems. The current
  version provides two optimization methods: Bayesian optimization and random
  search. Instead of giving the single best model, the final output is an
  ensemble of Gradient Boosted Trees constructed via the method of ensemble
  selection.
