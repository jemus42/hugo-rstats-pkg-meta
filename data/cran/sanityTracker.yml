title: Keeps Track of all Performed Sanity Checks
maintainer: Marsel Scheer
description: |-
  During the preparation of data set(s) one usually performs
  some sanity checks. The idea is that irrespective of where the
  checks are performed, they are centralized by this package in order
  to list all at once with examples if a check failed.
