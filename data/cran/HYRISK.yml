title: Hybrid Methods for Addressing Uncertainty in RISK Assessments
maintainer: Jeremy Rohmer
description: Methods for addressing uncertainty in risk assessments using hybrid representations
  of uncertainty (probability distributions, fuzzy numbers, intervals, probability
  distributions with imprecise parameters). The uncertainty propagation procedure
  combines random sampling using Monte Carlo method with fuzzy interval analysis of
  Baudrit et al. (2007) <doi:10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.876720>. The sensitivity analysis
  is based on the pinching method of Ferson and Tucker (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.ress.2005.11.052>.
