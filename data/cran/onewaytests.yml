title: One-Way Tests in Independent Groups Designs
maintainer: Osman Dag
description: Performs one-way tests in independent groups designs; one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA), Welch's heteroscedastic F test, Welch's heteroscedastic F test
  with trimmed means and Winsorized variances, Brown-Forsythe test, Alexander-Govern
  test, James second order test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Scott-Smith test, Box F test
  and Johansen F test, Generalized tests equivalent to Parametric Bootstrap and Fiducial
  tests. The package performs pairwise comparisons and graphical approaches. Also,
  the package includes Student's t test, Welch's t test and Mann-Whitney U test for
  two samples. Moreover, it assesses variance homogeneity and normality of data in
  each group via tests and plots (Dag et al., 2018, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-022/RJ-2018-022.pdf>).
