title: Distance Metrics for Image Color Similarity
maintainer: Hannah Weller
description: |-
  Loads and displays images, selectively masks specified background
  colors, bins pixels by color using either data-dependent or
  automatically generated color bins, quantitatively measures color
  similarity among images using one of several distance metrics for
  comparing pixel color clusters, and clusters images by object color
  similarity. Uses CIELAB, RGB, or HSV color spaces. Originally written
  for use with organism coloration (reef fish color diversity, butterfly
  mimicry, etc), but easily applicable for any image set.
