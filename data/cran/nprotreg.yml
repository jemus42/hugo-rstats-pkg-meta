title: Nonparametric Rotations for Sphere-Sphere Regression
maintainer: Giovanni Lafratta
description: |-
  Fits sphere-sphere regression models by estimating locally weighted rotations.
  Simulation of sphere-sphere data according to non-rigid rotation models.
  Provides methods for bias reduction applying iterative
  procedures within a Newton-Raphson learning scheme.
  Cross-validation is exploited to select smoothing parameters.
