title: Relational Data Modeler
maintainer: Patrice Godard
description: |-
  The aim of this package is to manipulate relational data models in R.
  It provides functions to create, modify and export data models in json format.
  It also allows importing models created with 'MySQL Workbench' (<https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/>).
  These functions are accessible through a graphical user interface made with 'shiny'.
  Constraints such as types, keys, uniqueness and mandatory fields are automatically checked and corrected when editing a model.
  Finally, real data can be confronted to a model to check their compatibility.
