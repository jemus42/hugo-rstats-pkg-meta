  Bayesian Classification and Information Sharing (BaCIS) Tool for
  the Design of Multi-Group Phase II Clinical Trials
maintainer: Nan Chen
description: |-
  Provides the design of multi-group phase
  II clinical trials with binary outcomes using the hierarchical Bayesian
  classification and information sharing (BaCIS) model. Subgroups are classified
  into two clusters on the basis of their outcomes mimicking the hypothesis
  testing framework. Subsequently, information sharing takes place within
  subgroups in the same cluster, rather than across all subgroups. This method can
  be applied to the design and analysis of multi-group clinical trials with binary
  outcomes. Reference: Nan Chen and J. Jack Lee (2019) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700275>.
