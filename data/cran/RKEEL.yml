title: Using KEEL in R Code
maintainer: Jose M. Moyano
description: |-
  'KEEL' is a popular Java software for a large number of different knowledge data discovery tasks.
  This package takes the advantages of 'KEEL' and R, allowing to use 'KEEL' algorithms in simple R code.
  The implemented R code layer between R and 'KEEL' makes easy both using 'KEEL' algorithms in R as implementing new algorithms for 'RKEEL' in a very simple way.
  It includes more than 100 algorithms for classification, regression, preprocess, association rules and imbalance learning, which allows a more complete experimentation process.
  For more information about KEEL, see <http://www.keel.es/>.
