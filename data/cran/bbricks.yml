  Bayesian Methods and Graphical Model Structures for Statistical
  Modeling
maintainer: Haotian Chen
description: A set of frequently used Bayesian parametric and nonparametric model
  structures, as well as a set of tools for common analytical tasks. Structures include
  linear Gaussian systems, Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Wishart conjugate structure,
  Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gamma conjugate structure, Categorical and Dirichlet
  conjugate structure, Dirichlet Process on positive integers, Dirichlet Process in
  general, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ... Tasks include updating posteriors, sampling
  from posteriors, calculating marginal likelihood, calculating posterior predictive
  densities, sampling from posterior predictive distributions, calculating "Maximum
  A Posteriori" (MAP) estimates ... See <https://chenhaotian.github.io/Bayesian-Bricks/>
