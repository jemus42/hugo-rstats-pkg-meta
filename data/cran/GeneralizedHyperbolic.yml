title: The Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution
maintainer: David Scott
description: |-
  Functions for the hyperbolic and related distributions.
  Density, distribution and quantile functions and random number generation
  are provided for the hyperbolic distribution, the generalized hyperbolic
  distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and
  the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is
  provided for the hyperbolic distribution, normal inverse
  Gaussian distribution and generalized inverse Gaussian distribution,
  including fitting of these distributions to data. Linear models with
  hyperbolic errors may be fitted using hyperblmFit.
