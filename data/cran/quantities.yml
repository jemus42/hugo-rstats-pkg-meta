maintainer: IÃ±aki Ucar
description: |-
  Integration of the 'units' and 'errors' packages for a complete
  quantity calculus system for R vectors, matrices and arrays, with automatic
  propagation, conversion, derivation and simplification of magnitudes and
  uncertainties. Documentation about 'units' and 'errors' is provided in the
  papers by Pebesma, Mailund & Hiebert (2016, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-061>) and
