  Endpoints'
maintainer: Muhtarjan Osman
description: A Bayesian testing procedure for noninferiority trials<U+000a>with binary
  endpoints. The prior is constructed based on<U+000a>Bernstein polynomials with options
  for both informative and<U+000a>non-informative prior. The critical value of the
  test statistic<U+000a>(Bayes factor) is determined by minimizing total weighted
  error<U+000a>(TWE) criteria
