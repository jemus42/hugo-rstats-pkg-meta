title: Interpolate Data for Smooth Animations
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  In order to create smooth animation between states of data,
  tweening is necessary. This package provides a range of functions for
  creating tweened data that can be used as basis for animation. Furthermore
  it adds a number of vectorized interpolaters for common R data
  types such as numeric, date and colour.
