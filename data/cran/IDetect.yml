title: Isolate-Detect Methodology for Multiple Change-Point Detection
maintainer: Andreas Anastasiou
description: |-
  Provides efficient implementation of the Isolate-Detect
  methodology for the consistent estimation of the number and location of multiple
  change-points in one-dimensional data sequences from the "deterministic
  + noise" model. For details on the Isolate-Detect methodology, please see Anastasiou and
  Fryzlewicz (2018) <https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/24cdcc_6a0866c574654163b8255e272bc0001b.pdf>.
  Currently implemented scenarios are: piecewise-constant signal with Gaussian
  noise, piecewise-constant signal with heavy-tailed noise, continuous piecewise-linear
  signal with Gaussian noise, continuous piecewise-linear signal with heavy-tailed noise.
