title: Sensitivity analysis for Observational studies.
maintainer: Greg Snow
description: |-
  Observational studies are limited in that there could be
  an unmeasured variable related to both the response variable
  and the primary predictor.  If this unmeasured variable were
  included in the analysis it would change the relationship
  (possibly changing the conclusions).  Sensitivity analysis is a
  way to see how much of a relationship needs to exist with the
  unmeasured variable before the conclusions change.  This
  package provides tools for doing a sensitivity analysis for
  regression (linear, logistic, and cox) style models.
