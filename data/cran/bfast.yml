title: Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST)
maintainer: Jan Verbesselt
description: BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend,<U+000a>seasonal,
  and remainder components with methods for detecting<U+000a>and characterizing abrupt
  changes within the trend and seasonal<U+000a>components. BFAST can be used to analyze
  different types of<U+000a>satellite image time series and can be applied to other
  disciplines<U+000a>dealing with seasonal or non-seasonal time series, such as hydrology,<U+000a>climatology,
  and econometrics. The algorithm can be extended to<U+000a>label detected changes
  with information on the parameters of the<U+000a>fitted piecewise linear models.
  BFAST monitoring functionality is added<U+000a>based on a paper that has been submitted
  to Remote Sensing of Environment.<U+000a>BFAST monitor provides functionality to
  detect disturbance in near real-time based on BFAST-type models.<U+000a>BFAST approach
  is flexible approach that handles missing data without interpolation.<U+000a>Furthermore
  now different models can be used to fit the time series data and detect structural
  changes (breaks).
