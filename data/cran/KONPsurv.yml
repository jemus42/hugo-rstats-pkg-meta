title: 'KONP Tests: Powerful K-Sample Tests for Right-Censored Data'
maintainer: Matan Schlesinger
description: The K-sample omnibus non-proportional hazards (KONP) tests are powerful
  non-parametric tests for comparing K (>=2) hazard functions based on right-censored
  data (Gorfine, Schlesinger and Hsu, 2019, <arXiv:1901.05739v1>). These tests are
  consistent against any differences between the hazard functions of the groups. The
  KONP tests are often more powerful than other existing tests, especially under non-proportional
  hazard functions.
