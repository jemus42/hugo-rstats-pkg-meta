title: Path Algorithm for Generalized Lasso Problems
maintainer: Taylor Arnold
description: Provides fast algorithms for computing the solution path for generalized
  lasso problems. Important use cases are the fused lasso over an arbitrary graph,
  and trend fitting of any given polynomial order. Specialized implementations for
  the latter two problems are given to improve stability and speed.
