title: Wild Bootstrap Size Diagnostics
maintainer: David Preinerstorfer
description: Implements the diagnostic "theta" developed in Poetscher and Preinerstorfer
  (2020) "How Reliable are Bootstrap-based Heteroskedasticity Robust Tests?" <arXiv:2005.04089>.
  This diagnostic can be used to detect and weed out bootstrap-based procedures that
  provably have size equal to one for a given testing problem. The implementation
  covers a large variety of bootstrap-based procedures, cf. the above mentioned article
  for details. A function for computing bootstrap p-values is provided.
