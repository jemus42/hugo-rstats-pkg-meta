title: Discretization-Based Direct Random Sample Generation
maintainer: Chel Hee Lee
description: Two discretization-based Monte Carlo algorithms, namely the Fu-Wang algorithm
  and the Wang-Lee algorithm, are provided for random sample generation from a high
  dimensional distribution of complex structure.  The normalizing constant of the
  target distribution needs not to be known.
