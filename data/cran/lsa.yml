title: Latent Semantic Analysis
maintainer: Fridolin Wild
description: |-
  The basic idea of latent semantic analysis (LSA) is,
  that text do have a higher order (=latent semantic) structure which,
  however, is obscured by word usage (e.g. through the use of synonyms
  or polysemy). By using conceptual indices that are derived statistically
  via a truncated singular value decomposition (a two-mode factor analysis)
  over a given document-term matrix, this variability problem can be overcome.
