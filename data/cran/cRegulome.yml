  Obtain and Visualize Regulome-Gene Expression Correlations in
  Cancer
maintainer: Mahmoud Ahmed
description: |-
  Builds a 'SQLite' database file of pre-calculated transcription
  factor/microRNA-gene correlations (co-expression) in cancer from the
  Cistrome Cancer Liu et al. (2011) <doi:10.1186/gb-2011-12-8-r83> and
  'miRCancerdb' databases (in press). Provides custom classes and functions
  to query, tidy and plot the correlation data.
