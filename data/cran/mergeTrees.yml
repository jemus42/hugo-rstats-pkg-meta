title: Aggregating Trees
maintainer: Audrey Hulot
description: |-
  Aggregates a set of trees with the same leaves to create a consensus tree. The trees are typically
  obtained via hierarchical clustering, hence the hclust format is used to encode both the aggregated trees and the final
  consensus tree. The method is exact and proven to be O(nqlog(n)), n being the individuals and q being the number of trees to aggregate.
