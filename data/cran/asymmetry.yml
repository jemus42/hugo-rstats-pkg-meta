title: Multidimensional Scaling of Asymmetric Data
maintainer: Berrie Zielman
description: Multidimensional scaling models and methods for the visualization for
  asymmetric data <doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1996.tb01078.x>. An asymmetric matrix has
  the same number of rows and columns, and these rows and columns refer to the same
  set of objects. At least some elements in the upper-triangle are different from
  the corresponding elements in the lower triangle. An example is a  student migration
  table, where the rows correspond to the countries of origin of the students and
  the columns to the destination countries. This package provides the slide-vector
  model <doi:10.1007/BF02294474>, a scaling model with unique dimensions and the asymscal
  model for asymmetric multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, a heat map for skew-symmetric
  data, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided for the analysis of asymmetric
  tables.
