title: A 'ggplot2' Extension for Plotting Unimodal Distributions
maintainer: Joseph M. Burling
description: |2-

  The 'ggdistribute' package is an extension for plotting posterior or other
  types of unimodal distributions that require overlaying information about a
  distribution's intervals. It makes use of the 'ggproto' system to extend
  'ggplot2', providing additional "geoms", "stats", and "positions."
  The extensions integrate with existing 'ggplot2' layer elements.
