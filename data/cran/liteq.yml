title: Lightweight Portable Message Queue Using 'SQLite'
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  Temporary and permanent message queues for R. Built on top of
  'SQLite' databases. 'SQLite' provides locking, and makes it possible
  to detect crashed consumers. Crashed jobs can be automatically marked
  as "failed", or put in the queue again, potentially a limited number of times.
