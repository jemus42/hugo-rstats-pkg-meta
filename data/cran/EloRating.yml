title: Animal Dominance Hierarchies by Elo Rating
maintainer: Christof Neumann
description: Provides functions to quantify animal dominance hierarchies. The major
  focus is on Elo rating and its ability to deal with temporal dynamics in dominance
  interaction sequences. For static data, David's score and de Vries' I&SI are also
  implemented. In addition, the package provides functions to assess transitivity,
  linearity and stability of dominance networks. See Neumann et al (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.016>
  for an introduction.
