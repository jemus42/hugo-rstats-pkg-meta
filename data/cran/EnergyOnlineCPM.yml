  Distribution Free Multivariate Control Chart Based on Energy
  Test
maintainer: Yafei Xu
description: Provides a function for distribution free control chart based on the
  change point model, for multivariate statistical process control. The main constituent
  of the chart is the energy test that focuses on the discrepancy between empirical
  characteristic functions of two random vectors. This new control chart highlights
  in three aspects. Firstly, it is distribution free, requiring no knowledge of the
  random processes. Secondly, this control chart can monitor mean and variance simultaneously.
  Thirdly it is devised for multivariate time series which is more practical in real
  data application. Fourthly, it is designed for online detection (Phase II), which
  is central for real time surveillance of stream data. For more information please
  refer to O. Okhrin and Y.F. Xu (2017) <https://github.com/YafeiXu/working_paper/raw/master/CPM102.pdf>.
