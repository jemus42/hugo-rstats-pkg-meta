title: Randomized Response Techniques for Complex Surveys
maintainer: Beatriz Cobo Rodr√≠guez
description: |-
  Point and interval estimation of linear parameters with data
  obtained from complex surveys (including stratified and clustered samples)
  when randomization techniques are used. The randomized response technique
  was developed to obtain estimates that are more valid when studying
  sensitive topics. Estimators and variances for 14 randomized response
  methods for qualitative variables and 7 randomized response methods for
  quantitative variables are also implemented. In addition, some data sets
  from surveys with these randomization methods are included in the package.
