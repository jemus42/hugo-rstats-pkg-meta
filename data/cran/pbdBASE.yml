  Programming with Big Data -- Base Wrappers for Distributed
  Matrices
maintainer: Wei-Chen Chen
description: |-
  An interface to and extensions for the 'PBLAS' and 'ScaLAPACK'
  numerical libraries.  This enables R to utilize distributed linear algebra
  for codes written in the 'SPMD' fashion.  This interface is deliberately
  low-level and mimics the style of the native libraries it wraps.  For a much
  higher level way of managing distributed matrices, see the 'pbdDMAT'
  package.
