title: Copy Number Profile Curve-Based Association Test
maintainer: Shannon T. Holloway
description: |-
  Implements a kernel-based association test for copy number
  variation (CNV) aggregate analysis
  in a certain genomic region (e.g., gene set, chromosome, or genome) that is
  robust to the within-locus and across-locus etiological heterogeneity, and
  bypass the need to define a "locus" unit for CNVs.
