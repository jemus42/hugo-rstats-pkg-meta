  Neural Networks using the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator
  (SNNS)
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: |-
  The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a library
  containing many standard implementations of neural networks. This
  package wraps the SNNS functionality to make it available from
  within R. Using the 'RSNNS' low-level interface, all of the
  algorithmic functionality and flexibility of SNNS can be accessed.
  Furthermore, the package contains a convenient high-level
  interface, so that the most common neural network topologies and
  learning algorithms integrate seamlessly into R.
