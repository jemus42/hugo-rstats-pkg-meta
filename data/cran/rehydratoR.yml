title: Downloads Tweets from a List of Tweet IDs
maintainer: Kevin Coakley
description: |-
  Facilitates replication of Twitter-based research by handling
  common programming tasks needed when downloading tweets.  Specifically, it ensures a
  user does not exceed Twitterâ€™s rate limits, and it saves tweets in moderately sized files.
  While a user could perform these tasks in their own code, doing so may be beyond the
  capabilities of many users.
