title: Backward Procedure for Change-Point Detection
maintainer: Seung Jun Shin
description: Implements a backward procedure for single and multiple change point
  detection proposed by Shin et al. <arXiv:1812.10107>. The backward approach is particularly
  useful to detect short and sparse signals which is common in copy number variation
  (CNV) detection.
