title: Analyze and Create Elegant Directed Acyclic Graphs
maintainer: Malcolm Barrett
description: |-
  Tidy, analyze, and plot directed acyclic graphs
  (DAGs). 'ggdag' is built on top of 'dagitty', an R package that uses
  the 'DAGitty' web tool (<http://dagitty.net>) for creating and
  analyzing DAGs. 'ggdag' makes it easy to tidy and plot 'dagitty'
  objects using 'ggplot2' and 'ggraph', as well as common analytic and
  graphical functions, such as determining adjustment sets and node
  relationships.
