  Importing and Analysing SNP and Silicodart Data Generated by
  Genome-Wide Restriction Fragment Analysis
maintainer: Bernd Gruber
description: |-
  Functions are provided that facilitate the import and analysis of
  SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and silicodart (presence/absence) data. The main focus is on data generated
  by DarT (Diversity Arrays Technology). However, once SNP or related fragment
  presence/absence data from any source is imported into a genlight object many
  of the functions can be used. Functions are available for input and output of
  SNP and silicodart data, for reporting on and filtering on various criteria
  (e.g. CallRate, Heterozygosity, Reproducibility, maximum allele frequency).
  Advanced filtering is based on Linkage Disequilibrium and HWE (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). Other functions
  are available for visualization after PCoA (Principle Coordinate Analysis), or to facilitate transfer of data
  between genlight/genind objects and newhybrids, related, phylip, structure, faststructure packages.
