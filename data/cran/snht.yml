title: Standard Normal Homogeneity Test
maintainer: Josh Browning
description: |-
  Implementation of robust and non-robust Standard Normal Homogeneity
  Test (SNHT) for changepoint detection. This test statistic is equal sided,
  as proposed in "Homogenization of Radiosonde Temperature Time Series Using
  Innovation Statistics" by Haimberger, L., 2007. However, the statistic contains
  an estimate of sigma^2 in the denominator instead of sigma, which seems to
  be a more appropriate value (based on the paper "Homogenization of Swedish
  temperature data. Part I: Homogeneity test for linear trends." by Alexandersson,
  H., and A. Moberg, 1997).
