title: Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models
maintainer: Rense Nieuwenhuis
description: |-
  Provides a collection of tools for
  detecting influential cases in generalized mixed effects
  models. It analyses models that were estimated using 'lme4'. The
  basic rationale behind identifying influential data is that
  when single units are omitted from the data, models
  based on these data should not produce substantially different
  estimates. To standardize the assessment of how influential a
  (single group of) observation(s) is, several measures of
  influence are common practice, such as Cook's Distance.
  In addition, we provide a measure of percentage change of the fixed point
  estimates and a simple procedure to detect changing levels of significance.
