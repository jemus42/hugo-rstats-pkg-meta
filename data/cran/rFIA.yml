title: Space-Time Estimation of Forest Variables using the FIA Database
maintainer: Hunter Stanke
description: The goal of 'rFIA' is to increase the accessibility and use of the United
  States Forest Services (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database by providing
  a user-friendly, open source toolkit to easily query and analyze FIA Data. Designed
  to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives, 'rFIA' simplifies the
  estimation of forest variables from the FIA Database and allows all R users (experts
  and newcomers alike) to unlock the flexibility inherent to the Enhanced FIA design.
  Specifically, 'rFIA' improves accessibility to the spatio-temporal estimation capacity
  of the FIA Database by producing space-time indexed summaries of forest variables
  within user-defined population boundaries. Direct integration with other popular
  R packages (e.g., 'dplyr', 'tidyr', and 'sf') facilitates efficient space-time query
  and data summary, and supports common data representations and API design. The package
  implements design-based estimation procedures outlined by Bechtold & Patterson (2005)
  <doi:10.2737/SRS-GTR-80>, and has been validated against estimates and sampling
  errors produced by FIA 'EVALIDator'. Current development is focused on the implementation
  of spatially-enabled model-assisted estimators to improve population, change, and
  ratio estimates.
