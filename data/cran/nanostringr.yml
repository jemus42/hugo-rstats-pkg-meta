  Performs Quality Control, Data Normalization, and Batch Effect
  Correction for 'NanoString nCounter' Data
maintainer: Derek Chiu
description: |-
  Provides quality control (QC), normalization, and
  batch effect correction operations for 'NanoString nCounter' data,
  Talhouk et al. (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153844>.  Various
  metrics are used to determine which samples passed or failed QC.  Gene
  expression should first be normalized to housekeeping genes, before a
  reference-based approach is used to adjust for batch effects.  Raw
  NanoString data can be imported in the form of Reporter Code Count
  (RCC) files.
