  Bayesian Analysis of Location-Scale Mixture Models using a
  Weakly Informative Prior
maintainer: Kaniav Kamary
description: A generic reference Bayesian analysis of unidimensional mixture distributions
  obtained by a location-scale parameterisation of the model is implemented. The including
  functions simulate and summarize posterior samples for location-scale mixture models
  using a weakly informative prior. There is no need to define priors for scale-location
  parameters except two hyperparameters in which are associated with a Dirichlet prior
  for weights and a simplex.
