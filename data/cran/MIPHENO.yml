  Mutant Identification through Probabilistic High throughput
  Enabled NOrmalization
maintainer: Shannon M. Bell
description: |-
  This package contains functions to carry out processing of
  high throughput data analysis and detection of putative
  hits/mutants.  Contents include a function for post-hoc quality
  control for removal of outlier sample sets, a median-based
  normalization method for use in datasets where there are no
  explicit controls and where most of the responses are of the
  wildtype/no response class (see accompanying paper).  The
  package also includes a way to prioritize individuals of
  interest using am empirical cumulative distribution function.
  Methods for generating synthetic data as well as data from the
  Chloroplast 2010 project are included.
