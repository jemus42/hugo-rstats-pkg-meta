title: A Computer Program to Detect Markers Responding to Selection
maintainer: Renaud Vitalis
description: In the new era of population genomics, surveys of genetic polymorphism
  ("genome scans") offer the opportunity to distinguish locus-specific from genome
  wide effects at many loci. Identifying presumably neutral regions of the genome
  that are assumed to be influenced by genome-wide effects only, and excluding presumably
  selected regions, is therefore critical to infer population demography and phylogenetic
  history reliably. Conversely, detecting locus-specific effects may help identify
  those genes that have been, or still are, targeted by natural selection. The software
  package DetSel has been developed to identify markers that show deviation from neutral
  expectation in pairwise comparisons of diverging populations.
