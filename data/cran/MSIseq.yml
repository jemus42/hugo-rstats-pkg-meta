  Assess Tumor Microsatellite Instability with a Decision Tree
  Classifier from Exome Somatic Mutations
maintainer: Mini Huang
description: A decision tree classifier for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI)
  in somatic mutation data from whole exome sequencing. MSI is detected based on different
  mutation rates in all sites as well as in simple sequence repeats. This mechanism
  can also be applied to sequence data of targeted gene panels with shorter sequence
  length.
