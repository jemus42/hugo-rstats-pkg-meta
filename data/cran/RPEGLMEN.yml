  Gamma and Exponential Generalized Linear Models with Elastic Net
  Penalty
maintainer: Anthony Christidis
description: |-
  Implements the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm
  (FISTA) algorithm to fit a Gamma distribution with an elastic net
  penalty as described in Chen, Arakvin and Martin (2018)
  <arxiv:1804.07780>. An implementation for the case of the
  exponential distribution is also available, with details available
  in Chen and Martin (2018) <https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=3085672>.
