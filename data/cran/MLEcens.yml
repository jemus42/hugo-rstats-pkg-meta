title: Computation of the MLE for bivariate (interval) censored data
maintainer: Marloes Maathuis
description: This package contains functions to compute the<U+000a>nonparametric maximum
  likelihood estimator (MLE) for the<U+000a>bivariate distribution of (X,Y), when
  realizations of (X,Y)<U+000a>cannot be observed directly.  To be more precise, we
  consider<U+000a>the situation where we observe a set of rectangles that are<U+000a>known
  to contain the unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We<U+000a>compute the MLE based
  on such a set of rectangles.  The methods<U+000a>can also be used for univariate
  censored data (see data set<U+000a>'cosmesis'), and for censored data with competing
  risks (see<U+000a>data set 'menopause').  We also provide functions to visualize<U+000a>the
  observed data and the MLE.
