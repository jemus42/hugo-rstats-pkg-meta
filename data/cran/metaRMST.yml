title: Meta-Analysis of RMSTD
maintainer: Isabelle Weir
description: 'R implementation of a multivariate meta-analysis of randomized controlled
  trials (RCT) with the difference in restricted mean survival times (RMSTD). Use
  this package with individual patient level data from an RCT for a time-to-event
  outcome to determine combined effect estimates according to 4 methods: 1)  a univariate
  meta-analysis using observed treatment effects, 2) a univariate meta-analysis using
  effects predicted by fitted Royston-Parmar flexible parametric models, 3) multivariate
  meta-analysis with analytically derived covariance, 4) multivariate meta-analysis
  with bootstrap derived covariance. This package computes all combined effects and
  provides an RMSTD curve with combined effect estimates and their confidence intervals.'
