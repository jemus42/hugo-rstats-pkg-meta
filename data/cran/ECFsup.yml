title: Equal Covariance Functions Testing by L2-Norm and Sup-Norm
maintainer: Bu Zhou
description: 'Testing the equality of several covariance functions of functional data.
  Four different methods are implemented: L2-norm with W-S naive, L2-norm with W-S
  bias-reduced, L2-norm (Zhang 2013) <ISBN:9781439862735>, and sup-norm with resampling
  (Guo et al. 2017) <arXiv:1609.04232>.'
