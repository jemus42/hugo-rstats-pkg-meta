title: Imputation Regularized Optimization Algorithm
maintainer: Bochao Jia
description: Missing data are frequently encountered in high-dimensional data analysis,
  but they are usually difficult to deal with using standard algorithms, such as the
  EM algorithm and its variants. This package provides a general algorithm, the so-called
  Imputation Regularized Optimization (IRO) algorithm, for high-dimensional missing
  data problems. You can refer to Liang, F., Jia, B., Xue, J., Li, Q. and Luo, Y.
