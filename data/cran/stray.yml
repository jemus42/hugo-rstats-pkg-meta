title: Anomaly Detection in High Dimensional and Temporal Data
maintainer: Priyanga Dilini Talagala
description: |2-

  This is a modification of 'HDoutliers' package. The 'HDoutliers' algorithm is a powerful
  unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a
  strong theoretical foundation. However, it suffers from some limitations that
  significantly hinder its performance level, under certain circumstances. This package
  implements the algorithm proposed in Talagala, Hyndman and Smith-Miles (2019)
  <arXiv:1908.04000>  for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data
  that addresses these limitations of 'HDoutliers' algorithm. We define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority
  with a large distance gap. An approach based on extreme value theory is used
  for the anomalous threshold calculation.
