title: Explore classification models in high dimensions
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: Given $p$-dimensional training data containing<U+000a>$d$ groups (the
  design space), a classification<U+000a>algorithm (classifier) predicts which group
  new data<U+000a>belongs to.  Generally the input to these algorithms is<U+000a>high
  dimensional, and the boundaries between groups<U+000a>will be high dimensional and
  perhaps curvilinear or<U+000a>multi-faceted. This package implements methods for<U+000a>understanding
  the division of space between the groups.
