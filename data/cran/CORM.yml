title: The Clustering of Regression Models Method
maintainer: Jiejun Shi
description: 'We proposed a new model-based clustering method, called the clustering
  of<U+000a>regression models method(CORM), which groups genes that share a similar<U+000a>relationship
  to the covariate(s). This method provides a unified approach<U+000a>for a family
  of clustering procedures and can be applied to data collected<U+000a>with various
  experimental designs. This package includes the implementation<U+000a>for two such
  clustering procedures: (1) the Clustering of Linear Models<U+000a>(CLM) method,
  and (2) the Clustering of Linear Mixed Models (CLMM) method.'
