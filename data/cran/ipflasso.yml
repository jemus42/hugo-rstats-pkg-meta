title: Integrative Lasso with Penalty Factors
maintainer: Anne-Laure Boulesteix
description: The core of the package is cvr2.ipflasso(), an extension of glmnet to
  be used when the (large) set of available predictors is partitioned into several
  modalities which potentially differ with respect to their information content in
  terms of prediction. For example, in biomedical applications patient outcome such
  as survival time or response to therapy may have to be predicted based on, say,
  mRNA data, miRNA data, methylation data, CNV data, clinical data, etc. The clinical
  predictors are on average often much more important for outcome prediction than
  the mRNA data. The ipflasso method takes this problem into account by using different
  penalty parameters for predictors from different modalities. The ratio between the
  different penalty parameters can be chosen from a set of optional candidates by
  cross-validation or alternatively generated from the input data.
