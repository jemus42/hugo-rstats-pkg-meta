title: Generalized Archimedean Copula
maintainer: Veronica Andrea Gonzalez-Lopez
description: 'Bi-variate data fitting is done by two stochastic<U+000a>components:
  the marginal distributions and the dependency<U+000a>structure. The dependency structure
  is modeled through a<U+000a>copula. An algorithm was implemented considering seven
  families<U+000a>of copulas (Generalized Archimedean Copulas), the best fitting<U+000a>can
  be obtained looking all copula''s options (totally positive<U+000a>of order 2 and
  stochastically increasing models).'
