title: Simulation of Ecological (and Other) Dynamic Systems
maintainer: Thomas Petzoldt
description: |-
  An object oriented framework to simulate
  ecological (and other) dynamic systems. It can be used for
  differential equations, individual-based (or agent-based) and other
  models as well. It supports structuring of simulation scenarios (to avoid copy
  and paste) and aims to improve readability and re-usability of code.
