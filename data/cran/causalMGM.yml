title: Causal Learning of Mixed Graphical Models
maintainer: Neha Abraham
description: Allows users to learn undirected and directed (causal) graphs over mixed
  data types (i.e., continuous and discrete variables). To learn a directed graph
  over mixed data, it first calculates the undirected graph (Sedgewick et al, 2016)
  and then it uses local search strategies to prune-and-orient this graph (Sedgewick
  et al, 2017). AJ Sedgewick, I Shi, RM Donovan, PV Benos (2016) <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1039-0>.
