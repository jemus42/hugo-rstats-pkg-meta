title: Hierarchical Bayesian Species Distribution Models
maintainer: Ghislain Vieilledent
description: User-friendly and fast set of functions for estimating parameters of
  hierarchical Bayesian species distribution models (Latimer et al. 2006 <doi:10.1890/04-0609>).
  Such models allow interpreting the observations (occurrence and abundance of a species)
  as a result of several hierarchical processes including ecological processes (habitat
  suitability, spatial dependence and anthropogenic disturbance) and observation processes
  (species detectability). Hierarchical species distribution models are essential
  for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting
  their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results.
