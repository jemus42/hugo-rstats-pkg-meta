description: |-
  Programs to find the sample size or power of studies using the
  Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD) and programs to analyze
  such studies. This is a clinical trial design where
  patients initially on placebo who did not respond are re-randomized between
  placebo and active drug in a second phase and the results of the two phases are
  pooled. The method of analyzing binary data with this design is described in
  Fava,Evins, Dorer and Schoenfeld(2003) <doi:10.1159/000069738>, and the
  method of analyzing continuous data is described in Chen, Yang,
  Hung and Wang (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.04.006>.
