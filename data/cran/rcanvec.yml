  Access and Plot CanVec and CanVec+ Data for Rapid Basemap
  Creation in Canada
maintainer: Dewey Dunnington
description: |-
  Provides an interface to the National Topographic System (NTS),
  which is the way in which a number of freely available Canadian datasets are
  organized. CanVec and CanVec+ datasets, which include all data used to create
  Canadian topographic maps, are two such datasets that are useful in creating
  vector-based maps for locations across Canada. This packages searches CanVec
  data by location, plots it using pretty defaults, and exports it to human-
  readable shapefiles for use in another GIS.
