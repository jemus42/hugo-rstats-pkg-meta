title: Bivariate Segmentation/Clustering Methods and Tools
maintainer: Remi Patin
description: |-
  Provides two methods for segmentation and joint segmentation/clustering of
  bivariate time-series. Originally intended for ecological segmentation
  (home-range and behavioural modes) but easily applied on other series,
  the package also provides tools for analysing outputs from R packages 'moveHMM' and 'marcher'.
  The segmentation method is a bivariate extension of  Lavielle's method available in 'adehabitatLT'
  (Lavielle, 1999 <doi:10.1016/S0304-4149(99)00023-X> and 2005 <doi:10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.01.012>).
  This method rely on dynamic programming for efficient segmentation.
  The segmentation/clustering method alternates steps of dynamic programming with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
  This is an extension of Picard et al (2007) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00729.x> method
  (formerly available in 'cghseg' package) to the bivariate case.
  The method is fully described in Patin et al (2018) <doi:10.1101/444794>.
