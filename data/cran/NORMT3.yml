description: |-
  Evaluates the probability density function of the sum of
  the Gaussian and Student's t density on 3 degrees of freedom.
  Evaluates the p.d.f. of the sphered Student's t density
  function.  Also evaluates the erf, and erfc functions on
  complex-valued arguments. Thanks to Krishna Myneni the function
  is calculates the Faddeeva function also!
