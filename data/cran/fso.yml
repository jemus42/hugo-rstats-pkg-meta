title: Fuzzy Set Ordination
maintainer: David W. Roberts
description: |-
  Fuzzy set ordination is a multivariate analysis used in ecology to
  relate the composition of samples to possible explanatory variables.  While
  differing in theory and method, in practice, the use is similar to 'constrained
  ordination.'  The package contains plotting and summary functions as well as
  the analyses.
