maintainer: Drew Schmidt
description: |-
  Utilities for secure password hashing via the argon2 algorithm.
  It is a relatively new hashing algorithm and is believed to be very secure.
  The 'argon2' implementation included in the package is the reference
  implementation.  The package also includes some utilities that should be
  useful for digest authentication, including a wrapper of 'blake2b'.  For
  similar R packages, see sodium and 'bcrypt'.  See
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2> or
  <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf> for more information.
