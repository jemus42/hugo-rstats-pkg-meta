title: Extracts Sentiment and Sentiment-Derived Plot Arcs from Text
maintainer: Matthew Jockers
description: |-
  Extracts sentiment and sentiment-derived plot arcs
  from text using a variety of sentiment dictionaries conveniently
  packaged for consumption by R users.  Implemented dictionaries include
  "syuzhet" (default) developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab
  "afinn" developed by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen, "bing" developed by Minqing Hu
  and Bing Liu, and "nrc" developed by Mohammad, Saif M. and Turney, Peter D.
  Applicable references are available in README.md and in the documentation
  for the "get_sentiment" function.  The package also provides a hack for
  implementing Stanford's coreNLP sentiment parser. The package provides
  several methods for plot arc normalization.
