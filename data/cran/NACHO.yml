description: |-
  NanoString nCounter data are gene expression assays
  where there is no need for the use of enzymes or amplification
  protocols and work with fluorescent barcodes (Geiss et al. (2018)
  <doi:10.1038/nbt1385>).  Each barcode is assigned a
  messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) which after bonding with its
  target can be counted.  As a result each count of a specific barcode
  represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.  'NACHO' (NAnoString
  quality Control dasHbOard) is able to analyse the exported NanoString
  nCounter data and facilitates the user in performing a quality
  control.  'NACHO' does this by visualising quality control metrics,
  expression of control genes, principal components and sample specific
  size factors in an interactive web application.
