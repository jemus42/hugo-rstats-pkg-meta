title: Incrementally Build Complex Plots using Natural Semantics
maintainer: Wanding Zhou
description: Builds complex plots, heatmaps in particular, using natural semantics.
  Bigger plots can be assembled using directives such as 'LeftOf', 'RightOf', 'TopOf',
  and 'Beneath' and more. Other features include clustering, dendrograms and integration
  with 'ggplot2' generated grid objects. This package is particularly designed for
  bioinformaticians to assemble complex plots for publication.
