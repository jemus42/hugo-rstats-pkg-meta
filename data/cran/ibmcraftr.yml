  Toolkits to Develop Individual-Based Models in Infectious
  Disease
maintainer: Sai Thein Than Tun
description: |-
  It provides a generic set of tools for initializing a synthetic
  population with each individual in specific disease states, and
  making transitions between those disease states according to the rates
  calculated on each timestep. The new version 1.0.0 has C++ code
  integration to make the functions run faster. It has also a higher level
  function to actually run the transitions for the number of timesteps
  that users specify. Additional functions will follow for changing
  attributes on demographic, health belief and movement.
