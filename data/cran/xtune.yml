  Regularized Regression with Differential Penalties Integrating
  External Information
maintainer: Chubing Zeng
description: Extends standard penalized regression (Lasso and Ridge) to allow differential
  shrinkage based on external information with the goal of achieving a better prediction
  accuracy. Examples of external information include the grouping of predictors, prior
  knowledge of biological importance, external p-values, function annotations, etc.
  The choice of multiple tuning parameters is done using an Empirical Bayes approach.
  A majorization-minimization algorithm is employed for implementation.
