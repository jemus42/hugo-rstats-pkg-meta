title: An Individual-Based Population Genetic Simulation Environment
maintainer: Allan Strand
description: |-
  An interface between R and the metasim simulation engine.
  The simulation environment is documented in: "Strand, A.(2002) <DOI:10.1046/j.1471-8286.2002.00208.x> Metasim 1.0: an individual-based environment for simulating population genetics of
  complex population dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes.
  Please see the vignettes CreatingLandscapes and Simulating to get some ideas on how to use the packages.
  See the rmetasim vignette to get an overview and to see important changes to the
  code in the most recent version.
