title: Estimation of Entropy, Mutual Information and Related Quantities
maintainer: Korbinian Strimmer
description: This package implements various estimators of entropy, such<U+000a>as
  the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum likelihood<U+000a>and
  the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and the<U+000a>Chao-Shen
  estimator.  It also offers an R interface to the NSB estimator.<U+000a>Furthermore,
  it provides functions for estimating Kullback-Leibler divergence,<U+000a>chi-squared,
  mutual information, and chi-squared statistic of independence.<U+000a>In addition
  there are functions for discretizing continuous random variables.
