title: Solver for Delay Differential Equations
maintainer: Rowan Haigh
description: |-
  Functions for solving systems of delay differential equations by
  interfacing with numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood, including
  contributions from Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines first
  appeared in Simon Wood's 'solv95' program. This package includes a vignette
  and a complete user's guide. 'PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under
  the name 'ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported. The current name
  emphasizes a close association with other 'PBS' packages, particularly
  'PBSmodelling'.
