  Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) Regression for Covariance
  Matrix Outcomes
maintainer: Yi Zhao
description: Performs Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) Regression for covariance
  matrix outcomes. The method identifies the optimal projection direction which maximizes
  the log-likelihood function of the log-linear heteroscedastic regression model in
  the projection space. See Zhao et al. (2018), Covariate Assisted Principal Regression
  for Covariance Matrix Outcomes, <doi:10.1101/425033> for details.
