title: Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations and Model Selection
maintainer: Zheng Li
description: Weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) is an extension of generalized
  linear models to longitudinal clustered data by incorporating the correlation within-cluster
  when data is missing at random (MAR). The parameters in mean, scale correlation
  structures are estimated based on quasi-likelihood. Multiple model selection criterion
  are provided for selection of mean model and working correlation structure based
  on WGEE/GEE.
