title: Bootstrap Resampling for Mixed Effects and Plain Models
maintainer: Colman Humphrey
description: |-
  Performs bootstrap resampling for most models that update() works for. There
  are two primary functions: bootstrap_model() performs block resampling if random effects
  are present, and case resampling if not; bootstrap_ci() converts output from
  bootstrap model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By default,
  bootstrap_model() calls bootstrap_ci().
  Package motivated by Humphrey and Swingley (2018) <arXiv:1805.08670>.
