title: Multivariate Renewal Hawkes Process
maintainer: Tom Stindl
description: |-
  Simulate a (bivariate) multivariate renewal Hawkes (MRHawkes)
  self-exciting process, with given immigrant hazard rate functions and
  offspring density function. Calculate the likelihood of a MRHawkes process
  with given hazard rate functions and offspring density function for an
  (increasing) sequence of event times. Calculate the Rosenblatt residuals of the
  event times. Predict future event times based on observed event times up to a
  given time. For details see Stindl and Chen (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2018.01.021>.
