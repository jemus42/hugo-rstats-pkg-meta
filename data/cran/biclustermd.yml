title: Biclustering with Missing Data
maintainer: John Reisner
description: |-
  Biclustering is a statistical learning technique that simultaneously
  partitions and clusters rows and columns of a data matrix. Since the solution
  space of biclustering is in infeasible to completely search with current
  computational mechanisms, this package uses a greedy heuristic. The algorithm
  featured in this package is, to the best our knowledge, the first biclustering
  algorithm to work on data with missing values. Li, J., Reisner, J., Pham, H.,
