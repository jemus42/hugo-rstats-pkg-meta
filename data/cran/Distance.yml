title: Distance Sampling Detection Function and Abundance Estimation
maintainer: Laura Marshall
description: |-
  A simple way of fitting detection functions to distance sampling
  data for both line and point transects. Adjustment term selection, left and
  right truncation as well as monotonicity constraints and binning are
  supported. Abundance and density estimates can also be calculated (via a
  Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator) if survey area information is provided.
