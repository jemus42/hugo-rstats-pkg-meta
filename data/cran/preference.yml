title: 2-Stage Preference Trial Design and Analysis
maintainer: Michael Kane
description: |-
  Design and analyze two-stage randomized trials with a continuous
  outcome measure. The package contains functions to compute the required
  sample size needed to detect a given preference, treatment, and selection
  effect; alternatively, the package contains functions that can report the
  study power given a fixed sample size. Finally, analysis functions are
  provided to test each effect using either summary data (i.e. means,
  variances) or raw study data.
