  Models

description: |-
  State space modelling is an efficient and flexible framework for
  statistical inference of a broad class of time series and other data. KFAS
  includes computationally efficient functions for Kalman filtering, smoothing,
  forecasting, and simulation of multivariate exponential family state space models,
  with observations from Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and gamma
  distributions. See the paper by Helske (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v078.i10> for details.
