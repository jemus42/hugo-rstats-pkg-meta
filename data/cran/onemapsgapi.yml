title: R Wrapper for the 'OneMap.Sg API'
maintainer: Jolene Lim
description: |-
  An R wrapper for the 'OneMap.Sg' API <https://docs.onemap.sg/>.
  Functions help users query data from the API and return raw JSON data
  in "tidy" formats. Support is also available for users to retrieve data from multiple API calls
  and integrate results into single dataframes, without
  needing to clean and merge the data themselves. This package is best suited for users who would
  like to perform analyses with Singapore's spatial data without having to perform excessive data cleaning.
