description: |-
  Comfortable ways to work with hyperspectral data sets.
  I.e. spatially or time-resolved spectra, or spectra with any other kind
  of information associated with each of the spectra. The spectra can be data
  as obtained in XRF, UV/VIS, Fluorescence, AES, NIR, IR, Raman, NMR, MS,
  etc. More generally, any data that is recorded over a discretized variable,
  e.g. absorbance = f (wavelength), stored as a vector of absorbance values
  for discrete wavelengths is suitable.
