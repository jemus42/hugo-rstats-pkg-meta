title: Dimension Reduction for Outlier Detection
maintainer: Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi
description: |-
  A dimension reduction technique for outlier detection. DOBIN: a Distance
  based Outlier BasIs using Neighbours, constructs a set of basis vectors for outlier
  detection. This is not an outlier detection method; rather it is a pre-processing
  method for outlier detection. It brings outliers to the fore-front using fewer basis
  vectors (Kandanaarachchi, Hyndman 2019) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.15437.18403>.
