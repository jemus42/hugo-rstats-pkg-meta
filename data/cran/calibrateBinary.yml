title: Calibration for Computer Experiments with Binary Responses
maintainer: Chih-Li Sung
description: Performs the calibration procedure proposed by Sung et al. (2018+) <arXiv:1806.01453>.
  This calibration method is particularly useful when the outputs of both computer
  and physical experiments are binary and the estimation for the calibration parameters
  is of interest.
