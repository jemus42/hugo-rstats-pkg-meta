version: 2.1.1
title: Threads Environment for R
maintainer: Norm Matloff
description: |-
  Provides a threads-type programming environment for R.
  The package gives the R programmer the clearer, more concise
  shared memory world view, and in some cases gives superior
  performance as well.  In addition, it enables parallel processing on
  very large, out-of-core matrices.
