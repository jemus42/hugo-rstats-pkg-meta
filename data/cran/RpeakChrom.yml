  Tools for Chromatographic Column Characterization and Modelling
  Chromatographic Peak
maintainer: Manuel David Peris Diaz
description: The quantitative measurement and detection of molecules in HPLC should
  be carried out by an accurate description of chromatographic peaks. In this package
  non-linear fitting using a modified Gaussian model with a parabolic variance (PVMG)
  has been implemented to obtain the retention time and height at the peak maximum.
  This package also includes the traditional Van Deemter approach and two alternatives
  approaches to characterize chromatographic column.
