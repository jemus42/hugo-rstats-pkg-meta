title: Extracts Environmental Data from 'ERDDAP' Web Services
maintainer: Roy Mendelssohn
description: |-
  Contains three functions that access
  environmental data from any 'ERDDAP' data web service. The rxtracto() function extracts
  data along a trajectory for a given "radius" around the point. The
  rxtracto_3D() function extracts data in a box. The rxtractogon() function
  extracts data in a polygon. All of those three function use the 'rerddap' package
  to extract the data, and should work with any 'ERDDAP' server.
  There are also two functions, plotBBox() and plotTrack() that use the 'plotdap'
  package to simplify the creation of maps of the data.
