  One-to-One Gene-Probeset Mapping for Affymetrix Human
  Microarrays
maintainer: Aron Eklund
description: 'On Affymetrix gene expression microarrays, a single gene may be measured
  by multiple probe sets. This can present a mild conundrum when attempting to evaluate
  a gene "signature" that is defined by gene names rather than by specific probe sets.
  This package provides a one-to-one mapping from gene to "best" probe set for four
  Affymetrix human gene expression microarrays: hgu95av2, hgu133a, hgu133plus2, and
  u133x3p. This package also includes the pre-calculated probe set quality scores
  that were used to define the mapping.'
