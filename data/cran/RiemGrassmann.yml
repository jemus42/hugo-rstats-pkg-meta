title: Inference, Learning, and Optimization on Grassmann Manifold
maintainer: Kisung You
description: Grassmann manifold is a set of k-planes or linear subspaces in Euclidean
  space. We provide algorithms for statistical inference, optimization, and learning
  over the Grassmann manifold. For general exposition to the statistics on the manifold,
  see the book by Chikuse (2003) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-21540-2>.
