title: Look Up Time Zones of Point Coordinates
maintainer: Andy Teucher
description: |-
  Input latitude and longitude values or an 'sf/sfc' POINT
  object and get back the time zone in which they exist. Two methods are implemented.
  One is very fast and uses 'Rcpp' in conjunction with data from the 'Javascript' library
  (<https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup/>). This method also works outside of countries'
  borders and in international waters, however speed comes at the cost of accuracy - near time
  zone borders away from populated centres there is a chance that it will return the incorrect
  time zone. The other method is slower but more accurate - it uses the 'sf' package to intersect
  points with a detailed map of time zones from here:
  <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/>. The package also
  contains several utility functions for helping to understand and visualize
  time zones, such as listing of world time zones, including information about
  daylight savings times and their offsets from UTC. You can also plot a
  time zone to visualize the UTC offset over a year and when daylight savings
  times are in effect.
