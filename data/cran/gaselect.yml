  Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Variable Selection from
  High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: David Kepplinger
description: |-
  Provides a genetic algorithm for finding variable
  subsets in high dimensional data with high prediction performance. The
  genetic algorithm can use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models or
  partial least squares (PLS) regression models to evaluate the prediction
  power of variable subsets. By supporting different cross-validation
  schemes, the user can fine-tune the tradeoff between speed and quality of
  the solution.
