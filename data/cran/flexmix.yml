title: Flexible Mixture Modeling
maintainer: Bettina Gruen
description: |-
  A general framework for finite mixtures of regression
  models using the EM algorithm is implemented. The E-step and all
  data handling are provided, while the M-step can be supplied by the
  user to easily define new models. Existing drivers implement
  mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear models and
  model-based clustering.
