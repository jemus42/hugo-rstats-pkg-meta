title: Additional Operators to Help you Write Cleaner R Code
maintainer: Ben Wiseman
description: Provides string arithmetic, reassignment operators, logical operators
  that handle missing values, and extra logical operators such as floating point equality
  and all or nothing. The intent is to allow R users to write code that is easier
  to read, write, and maintain while providing a friendlier experience to new R users
  from other language backgrounds (such as 'Python') who are used to concepts such
  as x += 1 and 'foo' + 'bar'.
