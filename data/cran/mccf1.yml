  Creates the MCC-F1 Curve and Calculates the MCC-F1 Metric and
  the Best Threshold
maintainer: Chang Cao
description: |-
  The MCC-F1 analysis is a method to evaluate the performance of binary classifications.
  The MCC-F1 curve is more reliable than the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Precision-Recall (PR)curve under imbalanced ground truth.
  The MCC-F1 analysis also provides the MCC-F1 metric that integrates classifier performance over varying thresholds, and the best threshold of binary classification.
