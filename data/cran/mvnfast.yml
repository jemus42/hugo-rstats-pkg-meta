title: Fast Multivariate Normal and Student's t Methods
maintainer: Matteo Fasiolo
description: |-
  Provides computationally efficient tools related to
  the multivariate normal and Student's t distributions. The main functionalities are:
  simulating multivariate random vectors, evaluating multivariate
  normal or Student's t densities and Mahalanobis distances. These tools are very efficient
  thanks to the use of C++ code and of the OpenMP API.
