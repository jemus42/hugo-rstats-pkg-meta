title: Chaos Game
maintainer: Florian Griessenberger
description: The main objective of the package is to enter a word of at least two
  letters based on which an Iterated Function System with Probabilities is constructed,
  and a two-dimensional fractal containing the chosen word infinitely often is generated
  via the Chaos Game. Additionally, the package allows to project the two-dimensional
  fractal on several three-dimensional surfaces and to transform the fractal into
  another fractal with uniform marginals.
