title: Statistical Inference for Enzyme Kinetics
maintainer: Donghyun Ra
description: |-
  Functions for estimating catalytic constant and Michaelis-Menten constant (MM constant) of
  stochastic Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics model are provided. The likelihood functions
  based on stochastic simulation approximation (SSA), diffusion approximation (DA), and
  Gaussian processes (GP) are provided to construct posterior functions for the Bayesian
  estimation. All functions utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with Metropolis-
  Hastings algorithm with random walk chain and robust adaptive Metropolis-Hastings
  algorithm based on Bayesian framework.
