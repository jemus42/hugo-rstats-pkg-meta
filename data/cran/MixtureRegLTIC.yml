maintainer: Yuh-Chyuan Tsay
description: Fit mixture regression models with nonsusceptibility/cure for left-truncated
  and interval-censored (LTIC) data (see Chen et al. (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5845>).
  This package also provides the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE)
  for the survival/event curves with LTIC data.
