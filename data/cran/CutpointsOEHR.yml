  Optimal Equal-HR Method to Find Two Cutpoints for U-Shaped
  Relationships in Cox Model
maintainer: Yimin Chen
description: Use optimal equal-HR method to determine two optimal cutpoints of a continuous
  predictor that has a U-shaped relationship with survival outcomes based on Cox regression
  model. The optimal equal-HR method estimates two optimal cut-points that have approximately
  the same log hazard value based on Cox regression model and divides individuals
  into different groups according to their HR values.
