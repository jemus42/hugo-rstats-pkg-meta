version: 1.0.2
title: Biogeographic Regionalization and Spatial Conservation
maintainer: Barnabas H. Daru
description: |-
  Computational infrastructure for biogeography, community ecology,
  and biodiversity conservation (Daru et al. 2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.02.12.945691>. It is
  based on the conceptual work in Daru et al.(2017) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.08.013> on
  patterns and processes of biogeographical regionalization. Additionally, the package
  contains fast and efficient functions to compute more standard conservation measures
  such as phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism, evolutionary distinctiveness
  and global endangerment, as well as compositional turnover (e.g., beta diversity).
