title: Smart Adaptive Recommendations
maintainer: Hong Ooi
description: '''Smart Adaptive Recommendations'' (SAR) is the name of a fast, scalable,
  adaptive algorithm for personalized recommendations based on user transactions and
  item descriptions. It produces easily explainable/interpretable recommendations
  and handles "cold item" and "semi-cold user" scenarios. This package provides two
  implementations of ''SAR'': a standalone implementation, and an interface to a web
  service in Microsoft''s ''Azure'' cloud: <https://github.com/Microsoft/Product-Recommendations/blob/master/doc/sar.md>.
  The former allows fast and easy experimentation, and the latter provides robust
  scalability and extra features for production use.'
