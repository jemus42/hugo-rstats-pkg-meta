title: A Parallel-Voting Algorithm for many Classifiers
maintainer: Wannes Rosiers
description: By sampling your data, running the provided classifier on these samples
  in parallel on your own machine and letting your models vote on a prediction, we
  return much faster predictions than the regular machine learning algorithm and possibly
  even more accurate predictions.
