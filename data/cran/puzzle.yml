title: Assembling Data Sets for Non-Linear Mixed Effects Modeling
maintainer: Mario Gonzalez Sales
description: To Simplify the time consuming and error prone task of assembling complex
  data sets for non-linear mixed effects modeling. Users are able to select from different
  absorption processes such as zero and first order, or a combination of both. Furthermore,
  data sets containing data from several entities, responses, and covariates can be
  simultaneously assembled.
