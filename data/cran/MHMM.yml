title: Finite Mixture of Hidden Markov Model
maintainer: Matthieu Marbac
description: Estimation of the latent states and partition by maximum likelihood.
  Model can be used for analyzing accelerometer data. In such a case, the latent states
  corresponds to activity levels and the partition permits to consider heterogeneity
  within the population. Emission laws are zero-inflated gamma distributions. Their
  parameters depends on the latent states but not on the partition, to compare the
  time spent by activity levels between classes. Model description is available in
  Du Roy de Chaumaray, M. and Marbac, M. and Navarro, F. (2019) <arXiv:1906.01547>.
