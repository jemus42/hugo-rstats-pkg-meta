  Simulate Longitudinal Dataset with Time-Varying Correlated
  Covariates
maintainer: Maya B. Mathur
description: Flexibly simulates a dataset with time-varying covariates with user-specified
  exchangeable correlation structures across and within clusters. Covariates can be
  normal or binary and can be static within a cluster or time-varying. Time-varying
  normal variables can optionally have linear trajectories within each cluster. See
  ?make_one_dataset for the main wrapper function. See Montez-Rath et al. <arXiv:1709.10074>
  for methodological details.
