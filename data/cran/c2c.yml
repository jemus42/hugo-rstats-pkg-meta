  Compare Two Classifications or Clustering Solutions of Varying
  Structure
maintainer: Mitchell Lyons
description: |-
  Compare two classifications or clustering solutions that may or may
  not have the same number of classes, and that might have hard or soft
  (fuzzy, probabilistic) membership. Calculate various metrics to assess how
  the clusters compare to each other. The calculations are simple, but provide
  a handy tool for users unfamiliar with matrix multiplication. This package
  is not geared towards traditional accuracy assessment for classification/
  mapping applications - the motivating use case is for comparing a
  probabilistic clustering solution to a set of reference or existing class
  labels that could have any number of classes (that is, without having to
  degrade the probabilistic clustering to hard classes).
