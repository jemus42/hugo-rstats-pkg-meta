title: Assertions to Check Properties of Data
maintainer: Richard Cotton
description: |-
  A set of predicates and assertions for checking the properties of
  (country independent) complex data types.  This is mainly for use by other
  package developers who want to include run-time testing features in
  their own packages.  End-users will usually want to use assertive directly.
