title: Rationalizing Rational Expectations. Tests and Deviations
maintainer: Christophe Gaillac
description: We implement a test of the rational expectations hypothesis based on
  the marginal distributions of realizations and subjective beliefs from D'Haultfoeuille,
  Gaillac, and Maurel (2018) <doi:10.3386/w25274>. This test can be used in cases
  where realizations and subjective beliefs are observed in two different datasets
  that cannot be matched, or when they are observed in the same dataset. The package
  also computes the estimator of the minimal deviations from rational expectations
  than can be rationalized by the data.
