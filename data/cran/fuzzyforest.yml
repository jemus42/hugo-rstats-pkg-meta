title: Fuzzy Forests
maintainer: Daniel Conn
description: |-
  Fuzzy forests, a new algorithm based on random forests,
  is designed to reduce the bias seen in random forest feature selection
  caused by the presence of correlated features.  Fuzzy forests uses
  recursive feature elimination random forests to select
  features from separate blocks of correlated features where the
  correlation within each block of features is high
  and the correlation between blocks of features is low.
  One final random forest is fit using the surviving features.
  This package fits random forests using the 'randomForest' package and
  allows for easy use of 'WGCNA' to split features into distinct blocks.
