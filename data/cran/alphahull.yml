  Generalization of the Convex Hull of a Sample of Points in the
  Plane
maintainer: Beatriz Pateiro-Lopez
description: |-
  Computation of the alpha-shape and alpha-convex
  hull of a given sample of points in the plane. The concepts of
  alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull generalize the definition of
  the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is
  based on the duality between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay
  triangulation. The package also includes a function that
  returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its
  dual Voronoi diagram in one single object.
