  Hidden Markov Models with Discrete Non-Parametric Observation
  Distributions
maintainer: Rolf Turner
description: |-
  Fits hidden Markov models with discrete non-parametric
  observation distributions to data sets.  The observations may
  be univariate or bivariate. Simulates data from such models.
  Finds most probable underlying hidden states, the most
  probable sequences of such states, and the log likelihood
  of a collection of observations given the parameters of
  the model.  Auxiliary predictors are accommodated in the
  univariate setting.
