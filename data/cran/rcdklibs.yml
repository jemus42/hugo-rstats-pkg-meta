version: '2.3'
title: The CDK Libraries Packaged for R
maintainer: Zachary Charlop-Powers
description: |-
  An R interface to the Chemistry Development Kit, a Java library
  for chemoinformatics. Given the size of the library itself, this package is
  not expected to change very frequently. To make use of the CDK within R, it is
  suggested that you use the 'rcdk' package. Note that it is possible to directly
  interact with the CDK using 'rJava'. However 'rcdk' exposes functionality in a more
  idiomatic way. The CDK library itself is released as LGPL and the sources can be
  obtained from <https://github.com/cdk/cdk>.
