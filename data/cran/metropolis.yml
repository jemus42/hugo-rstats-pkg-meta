title: The Metropolis Algorithm
maintainer: Alexander Keil
description: |-
  Learning and using the Metropolis algorithm for
  Bayesian fitting of a generalized linear model. The package vignette
  includes examples of hand-coding a logistic model using several
  variants of the Metropolis algorithm. The package also contains R
  functions for simulating posterior distributions of Bayesian
  generalized linear model parameters using guided, adaptive,
  guided-adaptive and random walk Metropolis algorithms. The random walk
  Metropolis algorithm was originally described in Metropolis et al
  (1953) <doi:10.1063/1.1699114>.
