title: Bayesian Estimation of Intervention Effects
maintainer: Jack Kuipers
description: An implementation of intervention effect estimation for DAGs (directed
  acyclic graphs) learned from binary data. First, parameters are estimated or sampled
  for the DAG and then interventions on each node (variable) are propagated through
  the network (do-calculus). Both exact computation (up to around 20 variables) and
  Monte Carlo schemes (for larger networks) are implemented.
