title: Robust Linear Quantile Regression
maintainer: Christian E. Galarza
description: |-
  It fits a robust linear quantile regression model using a new
  family of zero-quantile distributions for the error term. This family of
  distribution includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's t, Laplace, Slash
  and Contaminated Normal distribution. It also performs logistic quantile regression for bounded responses
  as shown in Bottai et.al.(2009) <doi:10.1002/sim.3781>. It provides estimates and full inference.
  It also provides envelopes plots for assessing the fit and confidences bands
  when several quantiles are provided simultaneously.
