title: Extract Equations from a Nomogram
maintainer: Zhicheng Du<dgdzc@hotmail.com>
description: |2-

  A nomogram can not be easily applied,
  because it is difficult to calculate the points or even the survival probability.
  The package, including a function of nomogramEx(),
  is to extract the polynomial equations to calculate the points of each variable,
  and the survival probability corresponding to the total points.
