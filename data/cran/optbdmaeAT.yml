title: Optimal Block Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray Experiments
maintainer: Dibaba Bayisa Gemechu
description: Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block designs for
  two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed
  effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all possible elementary
  treatment contrasts. The algorithms used in this package are based on the treatment
  exchange and array exchange algorithms of Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished).
  The package also provides an optional method of using the graphical user interface
  (GUI) R package tcltk to ensure that it is user friendly.
