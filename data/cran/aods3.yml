title: Analysis of Overdispersed Data using S3 Methods
maintainer: Renaud Lancelot
description: |-
  Provides functions to analyse overdispersed
  counts or proportions.  These functions should be considered as
  complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
  estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect
  models (GLMM). aods3 is an S3 re-implementation of the
  deprecated S4 package aod.
