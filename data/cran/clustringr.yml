title: Cluster Strings by Edit-Distance
maintainer: Dan S. Reznik
description: |-
  Returns an edit-distance based clusterization of an input vector of strings.
  Each cluster will contain a set of strings w/ small mutual edit-distance
  (e.g., Levenshtein, optimum-sequence-alignment, Damerau-Levenshtein), as computed by
  stringdist::stringdist(). The set of all mutual edit-distances is then used by
  graph algorithms (from package 'igraph') to single out subsets of high connectivity.
