title: Visualization of Multivariate Functions, Sets, and Data
maintainer: Jussi Klemela
description: |2-

  We provide tools to
  (1) visualize multivariate density functions and density estimates
  with level set trees,
  (2) visualize level sets with shape trees,
  (3) visualize multivariate data with tail trees,
  (4) visualize scales of multivariate density estimates with
  mode graphs and branching maps, and
  (5) visualize anisotropic spread with 2D volume functions and
  2D probability content functions.
  Level set trees visualize mode structure,
  shape trees visualize shapes of level sets of unimodal densities,
  and tail trees visualize connected data sets.
  The kernel estimator is implemented
  but the package may  also be applied for visualizing other density estimates.
