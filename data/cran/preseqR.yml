title: Predicting Species Accumulation Curves
maintainer: Chao Deng
description: Originally as an R version of Preseq <doi:10.1038/nmeth.2375>, the package
  has extended its functionality to predict the r-species accumulation curve (r-SAC),
  which is the number of species represented at least r times as a function of the
  sampling effort. When r = 1, the curve is known as the species accumulation curve,
  or the library complexity curve in high-throughput genomic sequencing. The package
  includes both parametric and nonparametric methods, as described by Deng C, et al.
