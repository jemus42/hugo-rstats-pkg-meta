  Within-Species Variation
maintainer: Eric W. Goolsby
description: Tools for performing phylogenetic comparative methods for datasets with
  with multiple observations per species (intraspecific variation or measurement error)
  and/or missing data. Performs ancestral state reconstruction and missing data imputation
  on the estimated evolutionary model, which can be specified as Brownian Motion,
  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Early-Burst, Pagel's lambda, kappa, or delta, or a star phylogeny.
