title: Isotope Origin Clustering and Assignment Tools
maintainer: Caitlin Campbell
description: |-
  This resource provides tools to create, compare, and post-process
  spatial isotope assignment models of animal origin. It generates
  probability-of-origin maps for individuals based on user-provided tissue and
  environment isotope values (e.g., as generated by IsoMAP, Bowen [2010]
  <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12147>) using the framework established in Bowen
  (2014) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12147>. The package 'isocat' can then
  quantitatively compare and cluster these maps to group individuals by
  similar origin. It also includes techniques for applying four approaches
  (cumulative sum, odds ratio, quantile only, and quantile simulation) with
  which users can summarize geographic origins and probable distance traveled
  by individuals.
