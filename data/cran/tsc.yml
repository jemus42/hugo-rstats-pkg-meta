title: Likelihood-ratio Tests for Two-Sample Comparisons
maintainer: Yang Zhao
description: 'Performs the two-sample comparisons using the following exact test procedures:
  the exact likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for equality of two normal populations proposed
  in Zhang et al. (2012); the combined test based on the LRT and Shapiro-Wilk test
  for normality via the Bonferroni correction technique; the newly proposed density-based
  empirical likelihood (DBEL) ratio test. To calculate p-values of the DBEL procedures,
  three procedures are used: (a) the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method implemented
  in C++, (b) a new interpolation method based on regression techniques to operate
  with tabulated critical values of the test statistic; (c) a Bayesian type method
  that uses the tabulated critical values as the prior information and  MC generated
  DBEL-test-statistic''s values as data.'
