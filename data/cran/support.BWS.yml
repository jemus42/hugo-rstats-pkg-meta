title: Tools for Case 1 Best-Worst Scaling
maintainer: Hideo Aizaki
description: 'Provides basic functions that support an implementation of object case
  (Case 1) best-worst scaling: a function for converting a two-level orthogonal main-effect
  design/balanced incomplete block design into questions; two functions for creating
  a data set suitable for analysis; a function for calculating count-based scores;
  a function for calculating shares of preference; and a function for generating artificial
  responses to questions. For details on best-worst scaling, see Louviere et al. (2015)
  <doi:10.1017/CBO9781107337855>.'
