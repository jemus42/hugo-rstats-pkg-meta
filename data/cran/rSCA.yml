title: An R Package for Stepwise Cluster Analysis
maintainer: Xiuquan (Xander) Wang
description: A statistical tool for multivariate modeling and clustering using stepwise
  cluster analysis. The modeling output of rSCA is constructed as a cluster tree to
  represent the complicated relationships between multiple dependent and independent
  variables. A free tool (named rSCA Tree Generator) for visualizing the cluster tree
  from rSCA is also released and it can be downloaded at <https://rscatree.weebly.com/>.
