  Squared Extrapolation Methods for Accelerating EM-Like Monotone
  Algorithms
maintainer: Ravi Varadhan
description: |-
  Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow,
  monotone sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the
  EM algorithm. It can be used to accelerate any smooth, linearly
  convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction
  to this package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download
  page or, when the package is loaded in an R session, with
  vignette("SQUAREM"). Refer to the J Stat Software article: <doi:10.18637/jss.v092.i07>.
