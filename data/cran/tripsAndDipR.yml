  Identification of 2n and 3n Samples from Amplicon Sequencing
  Data
maintainer: Thomas Delomas
description: |-
  Uses read counts for biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  to compare the likelihoods for the observed read counts given that a sample is
  either diploid or triploid. It allows parameters to be specified to account for
  sequencing error rates and allelic bias. For details of the algorithm, please see
  Delomas (2019) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13073>.
