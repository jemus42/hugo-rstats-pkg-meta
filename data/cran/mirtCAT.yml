  Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item
  Response Theory
maintainer: Phil Chalmers
description: |-
  Provides tools to generate an HTML interface for creating adaptive
  and non-adaptive educational and psychological tests using the shiny
  package (Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i05>).
  Suitable for applying unidimensional and multidimensional
  computerized adaptive tests (CAT) using item response theory methodology and for
  creating simple questionnaires forms to collect response data directly in R.
  Additionally, optimal test designs (e.g., "shadow testing") are supported
  for tests which contain a large number of item selection constraints.
  Finally, package contains tools useful for performing Monte Carlo simulations
  for studying the behavior of computerized adaptive test banks.
