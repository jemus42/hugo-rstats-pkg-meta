  Survival Trees to Fit Left-Truncated and Right-Censored and
  Interval-Censored Survival Data
maintainer: Wei Fu

  Recursive partition algorithms designed for fitting survival tree with left-truncated and right censored (LTRC) data, as well as interval-censored data.
  The LTRC trees can also be used to fit survival tree with time-varying covariates.
