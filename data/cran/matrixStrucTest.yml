title: Tests of Matrix Structure for Construct Validation
maintainer: Brian D. Segal
description: Tests for block-diagonal structure in symmetric matrices (e.g. correlation
  matrices) under the null hypothesis of exchangeable off-diagonal elements. As described
  in Segal et al. (2019), these tests can be useful for construct validation either
  by themselves or as a complement to confirmatory factor analysis. Monte Carlo methods
  are used to approximate the permutation p-value with Hubert's Gamma (Hubert, 1976)
  and a t-statistic. This package also implements the chi-squared statistic described
  by Steiger (1980). Please see Segal, et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9647-4>
  for more information.
