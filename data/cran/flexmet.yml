  Flexible Latent Trait Metrics using the Filtered Monotonic
  Polynomial Item Response Model
maintainer: Leah Feuerstahler
description: |-
  Application of the filtered monotonic polynomial (FMP) item response
  model to flexibly fit item response models. The package includes tools that
  allow the item response model to be build on any monotonic transformation of
  the latent trait metric, as described by Feuerstahler (2016) <http://hdl.handle.net/11299/182267>.
