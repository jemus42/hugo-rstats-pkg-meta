title: Empirical CDF for Heavy Tailed Data
maintainer: John P Nolan
description: |-
  Computes and plots a transformed empirical CDF (ecdf) as a
  diagnostic for heavy tailed data, specifically data with power law decay on the
  tails.  Routines for annotating the plot, comparing data to a model, fitting a
