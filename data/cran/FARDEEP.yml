  Fast and Robust Deconvolution of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte
  from Expression Profiles using Least Trimmed Squares
maintainer: Yuying Xie
description: Using the idea of least trimmed square, it could automatically detects
  and removes outliers from data before estimating the coefficients. It is a robust
  machine learning tool which can be applied to gene-expression deconvolution technique.
