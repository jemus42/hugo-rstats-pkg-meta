description: 'The basic idea of this package is provides some tools to help the researcher
  to work with geostatistics. Initially, we present a collection of functions that
  allow the researchers to deal with spatial data using bootstrap procedure.There
  are five methods available and two ways to display them: bootstrap confidence interval
