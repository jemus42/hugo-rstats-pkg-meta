  Simulation and Parameter Estimation of Randomized Sierpinski
  Carpets using the p-p-p-q-Model
maintainer: Philipp Hermann
description: The parameters p and q are estimated with the aid of a randomized Sierpinski
  Carpet which is built on a [p-p-p-q]-model. Thereby, for three times a simulation
  with a p-value and once with a q-value is assumed. Hence, these parameters are estimated
  and displayed. Moreover, functions for simulating random Sierpinski-Carpets with
  constant and variable probabilities are included. For more details on the method
  please see Hermann et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/sim.6497>.
