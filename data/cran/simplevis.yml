version: 1.1.3
title: Simple Visualisation with 'ggplot2' and 'leaflet' Wrappers
maintainer: David Hodge
description: Provides 'ggplot2' and 'leaflet' wrapper functions designed to simplify
  the creation of high quality graph and map visualisations. These functions only
  require inputs of data, variables and titles to provide beautiful interactive or
  image visualisations. However they allow for more flexibility if required. The intent
  is that high quality well-designed graphs and maps can be made more consistently
  with less effort, code and expertise than would otherwise be required.
