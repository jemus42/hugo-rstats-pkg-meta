title: Analyzing Ecological Networks
maintainer: Vincent Miele
description: A collection of advanced tools, methods and models specifically  designed  for  analyzing
  different  types  of  ecological  networks - especially  antagonistic  (food  webs,  host-parasite),  mutualistic
  (plant-pollinator, plant-fungus, etc)  and competitive networks, as well as their
  variability in time and space. Statistical models are developed to describe and
  understand the mechanisms that determine species interactions, and to decipher the
  organization of these (multi-layer) ecological networks.
