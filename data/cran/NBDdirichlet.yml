  NBD-Dirichlet Model of Consumer Buying Behavior for Marketing
  Research
maintainer: Feiming Chen
description: |-
  The Dirichlet (aka NBD-Dirichlet) model describes the
  purchase incidence and brand choice of consumer products.  We
  estimate the model and summarize various theoretical quantities
  of interest to marketing researchers. Also provides functions
  for making tables that compare observed and theoretical
  statistics.
