title: Simulate Expression Data from 'igraph' Networks
maintainer: S. Thomas Kelly
description: Functions to develop simulated continuous data (e.g., gene expression)
  from a sigma covariance matrix derived from a graph structure in 'igraph' objects.
  Intended to extend 'mvtnorm' to take 'igraph' structures rather than sigma matrices
  as input.
