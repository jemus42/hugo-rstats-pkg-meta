description: 'A generic tool for manifold analysis. It allows to infer a relevant
  transition or evolutionary path which can highlights the features involved in a
  specific process. ''spathial'' can be useful in all the scenarios where the temporal
  (or pseudo-temporal) evolution is the main problem (e.g. tumor progression). The
  algorithm for finding the principal path is described in: Ferrarotti et al., (2019)
  <doi:10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2884792>."'
