title: Multiple Hypothesis Test Based on Distribution of p Values
maintainer: Abhirup Mallik
description: |-
  A framework for multiple hypothesis testing based on distribution
  of p values. It is well known that the p values come from different
  distribution for null and alternatives, in this package we provide
  functions to detect that change. We provide a method for using the change
  in distribution of p values as a way to detect the true signals in the
  data.
