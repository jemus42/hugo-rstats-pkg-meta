  Censoring

description: Semiparametric regression models on the cumulative incidence function
  for interval-censored competing risks data as described in Bakoyannis, Yu, & Yiannoutsos
  (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7350>. In addition, missing event types or left truncation
  are considered. We provide the proportional subdistribution hazards model (Fine-Gray
  model), the proportional odds model, and other models that belong to the class of
  semiparametric generalized odds rate transformation models.
