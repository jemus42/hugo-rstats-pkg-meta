title: Node Harvest for Regression and Classification
maintainer: Nicolai Meinshausen
description: Node harvest is a simple interpretable tree-like estimator for high-dimensional
  regression and classification. A few nodes are selected from an initially large
  ensemble of nodes, each associated with a positive weight. New observations can
  fall into one or several nodes and predictions are the weighted average response
  across all these groups. The package offers visualization of the estimator. Predictions
  can return the nodes a new observation fell into, along with the mean response of
  training observations in each node, offering a simple explanation of the prediction.
