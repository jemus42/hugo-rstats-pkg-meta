description: Perform FlexBoost in R. FlexBoost is a newly suggested algorithm based
  on AdaBoost by adjusting adaptive loss functions. Not only FlexBoost but also other
  machine learning algorithms (e.g. Support Vector Machines) will be added. For more
  details on FlexBoost see Jeon, Y. S., Yang, D. H., & Lim, D. J. (2019) <doi:10.1109/access.2019.2938356>.
