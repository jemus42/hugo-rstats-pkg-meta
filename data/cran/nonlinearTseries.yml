title: Nonlinear Time Series Analysis
maintainer: Constantino A. Garcia
description: |-
  Functions for nonlinear time series analysis. This package permits
  the computation of the  most-used nonlinear statistics/algorithms
  including generalized correlation dimension, information dimension,
  largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy and Recurrence
  Quantification Analysis (RQA), among others. Basic routines
  for surrogate data testing are also included. Part of this work
  was based on the  book "Nonlinear time series analysis" by
  Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber (ISBN: 9780521529020).
