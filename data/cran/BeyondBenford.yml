  Compare the Goodness of Fit of Benford's and Blondeau Da Silva's
  Digit Distributions to a Given Dataset
maintainer: Blondeau Da Silva Stephane
description: 'Allows to compare the goodness of fit of Benford''s and Blondeau Da
  Silva''s digit distributions in a dataset. It is used to check whether the data
  distribution is consistent with theoretical distributions highlighted by Blondeau
  Da Silva or not (through the dat.distr() function): this ideal theoretical distribution
  must be at least approximately followed by the data for the use of Blondeau Da Silva''s
  model to be well-founded. It also enables to plot histograms of digit distributions,
  both observed in the dataset and given by the two theoretical approaches (with the
  digit.ditr() function). Finally, it proposes to quantify the goodness of fit via
  Pearson''s chi-squared test (with the chi2() function).'
