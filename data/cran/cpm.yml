  Sequential and Batch Change Detection Using Parametric and
  Nonparametric Methods
maintainer: Gordon J. Ross
description: Sequential and batch change detection for univariate data streams, using
  the change point model framework. Functions are provided to allow nonparametric
  distribution-free change detection in the mean, variance, or general distribution
  of a given sequence of observations. Parametric change detection methods are also
  provided for Gaussian, Bernoulli and Exponential sequences. Both the batch (Phase
  I) and sequential (Phase II) settings are supported, and the sequences may contain
  either a single or multiple change points.
