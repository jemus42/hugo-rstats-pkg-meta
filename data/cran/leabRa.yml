title: The Artificial Neural Networks Algorithm Leabra
maintainer: Johannes Titz
description: |-
  The algorithm Leabra (local error driven and associative
  biologically realistic algorithm) allows for the construction of artificial
  neural networks that are biologically realistic and balance supervised and
  unsupervised learning within a single framework. This package is based on
  the 'MATLAB' version by Sergio Verduzco-Flores, which in turn was based on
  the description of the algorithm by Randall O'Reilly (1996)
  <ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/thesis/oreilly_thesis.all.pdf>. For
  more general (not 'R' specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see
