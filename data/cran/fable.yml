title: Forecasting Models for Tidy Time Series
maintainer: Mitchell O'Hara-Wild
description: |-
  Provides a collection of commonly used univariate and multivariate
  time series forecasting models including automatically selected exponential
  smoothing (ETS) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.
  These models work within the 'fable' framework provided by the 'fabletools'
  package, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualise, and combine models
  in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.
