title: Variable Selection via Tilted Correlation Screening Algorithm
maintainer: Haeran Cho
description: Implements an algorithm for variable selection in high-dimensional linear
  regression using the "tilted correlation", a new way of measuring the contribution
  of each variable to the response which takes into account high correlations among
  the variables in a data-driven way.
