title: Evolutionary Learning of Globally Optimal Trees
maintainer: Thomas Grubinger
description: |-
  Commonly used classification and regression tree methods like the CART algorithm
  are recursive partitioning methods that build the model in a forward stepwise search.
  Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive
  tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at
  the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is
  to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. The 'evtree' package
  implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and
  regression trees in R. CPU and memory-intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while
  the 'partykit' package is leveraged to represent the resulting trees in R, providing
  unified infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions.
