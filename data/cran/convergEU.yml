maintainer: Federico M. Stefanini
description: |-
  Indicators and measures by country and time describe
  what happens at economic and social levels. This package provides
  functions to calculate several measures of convergence after imputing
  missing values. The automated downloading of Eurostat data,
  followed by the production of country fiches and indicator fiches,
  makes possible to produce automated reports.
