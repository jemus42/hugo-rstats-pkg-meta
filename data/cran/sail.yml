title: Sparse Additive Interaction Learning
maintainer: Sahir Bhatnagar
description: |-
  Sparse additive interaction learning with the strong heredity property, i.e.,
  an interaction is selected only if its corresponding main effects are also included.
  Fits a linear model with non-linear interactions via penalized maximum likelihood.
  Interactions are limited to a single exposure or environment variable. For more information,
  see the website below and the accompanying paper: Bhatnagar et al., "A sparse additive model for
  high-dimensional interactions with an exposure variable", 2019, <DOI:10.1101/445304>.
