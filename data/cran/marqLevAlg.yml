  A Parallelized General-Purpose Optimization Based on
  Marquardt-Levenberg Algorithm
maintainer: Viviane Philipps
description: |-
  This algorithm provides a numerical solution to the
  problem of minimizing (or maximizing) a function. It is particularly suited for complex problems and more efficient than
  the Gauss-Newton-like algorithm when starting from points very
  far from the final minimum (or maximum). Each iteration is parallelized and convergence relies on a stringent stopping criterion based on the first and second derivatives.
