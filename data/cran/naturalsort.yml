title: Natural Ordering
maintainer: Kosei Abe
description: |-
  Provides functions related to human natural ordering.
  It handles adjacent digits in a character sequence as a number so that
  natural sort function arranges a character vector by their numbers, not digit
  characters. It is typically seen when operating systems lists file names. For
  example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png looks naturally ordered because 1
  < 2 < 10 and natural sort algorithm arranges so whereas general sort algorithms
  arrange it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their third and fourth
  characters.
