title: Binning and Plotting of Linearly Referenced Data
maintainer: Ethan Z. Welty
description: |-
  Short for 'linear binning', the linbin package provides functions
  for manipulating, binning, and plotting linearly referenced data. Although
  developed for data collected on river networks, it can be used with any interval
  or point data referenced to a 1-dimensional coordinate system. Flexible bin
  generation and batch processing makes it easy to compute and visualize variables
  at multiple scales, useful for identifying patterns within and between variables
  and investigating the influence of scale of observation on data interpretation.
