title: Three-Way / Multigroup Data Analysis Through Densities
maintainer: Rachid Boumaza
description: The data consist of a set of variables measured on several groups of
  individuals. To each group is associated an estimated probability density function.
  The package provides tools to create or manage such data and functional methods
  (principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, discriminant
  analysis...) for such probability densities.
