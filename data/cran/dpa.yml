description: A GUI or command-line operated data analysis tool, for<U+000a>analyzing
  time-dependent simulation data in which multiple<U+000a>instantaneous or time-lagged
  relations are assumed. This<U+000a>package uses Structural Equation Modeling (the
  sem package). It<U+000a>is aimed to deal with time-dependent data and estimate whether<U+000a>a
  causal diagram fits data from an (agent-based) simulation<U+000a>model.
