title: Linear Splines with Convenient Parametrisations
maintainer: Michal Bojanowski
description: |-
  Linear splines with convenient parametrisations such that
  (1) coefficients are slopes of consecutive segments or (2) coefficients are
  slope changes at consecutive knots. Knots can be set manually or at break points
  of equal-frequency or equal-width intervals covering the range of 'x'.
  The implementation follows Greene (2003), chapter 7.2.5.
