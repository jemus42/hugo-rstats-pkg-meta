description: Approximations of global p-values when testing hypothesis in presence
  of non-identifiable nuisance parameters. The method relies on the Euler characteristic
  heuristic and the expected Euler characteristic is efficiently computed by  in Algeri
  and van Dyk (2018) <arXiv:1803.03858>.
