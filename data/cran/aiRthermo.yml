title: Atmospheric Thermodynamics and Visualization
maintainer: Santos J. González-Rojí
description: Deals with many computations related to the thermodynamics of atmospheric
  processes. It includes many functions designed to consider the density of air with
  varying degrees of water vapour in it, saturation pressures and mixing ratios, conversion
  of moisture indices, computation of atmospheric states of parcels subject to dry
  or pseudoadiabatic vertical evolutions and atmospheric instability indices that
  are routinely used for operational weather forecasts or meteorological diagnostics.
