title: Exact Test and Visualization of Multi-Set Intersections
maintainer: Minghui Wang
description: Identification of sets of objects with shared features is a common operation
  in all disciplines. Analysis of intersections among multiple sets is fundamental
  for in-depth understanding of their complex relationships. This package implements
  a theoretical framework for efficient computation of statistical distributions of
  multi-set intersections based upon combinatorial theory, and provides multiple scalable
  techniques for visualizing the intersection statistics. The statistical algorithm
  behind this package was published in Wang et al. (2015) <doi:10.1038/srep16923>.
