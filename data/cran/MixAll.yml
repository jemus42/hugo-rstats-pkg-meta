maintainer: Serge Iovleff
description: |-
  Algorithms and methods for model-based clustering and classification.
  It supports various types of data: continuous, categorical and counting
  and can handle mixed data of these types. It can fit Gaussian (with diagonal
  covariance structure), gamma, categorical and Poisson models. The algorithms
  also support missing values. This package can be used as an independent
  alternative to the (not free) 'mixtcomp' software available at
  <https://massiccc.lille.inria.fr/>.
