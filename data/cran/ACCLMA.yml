description: The main function is plotLMA(sourcefile,header) that takes<U+000a>a data
  set and plots the appropriate LMA and ACC graphs. If no<U+000a>sourcefile (a string)
  was passed, a manual data entry window is<U+000a>opened. The header parameter indicates

  not. The data<U+000a>set should contain only one independent variable (X) and one<U+000a>dependent
  varialbe (Y) and can contain a weight for each<U+000a>observation
