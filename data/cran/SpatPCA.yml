title: Regularized Principal Component Analysis for Spatial Data
maintainer: Wen-Ting Wang
description: |-
  Provide regularized principal component analysis incorporating smoothness, sparseness and orthogonality of eigenfunctions
  by using the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm (Wang and Huang, 2017, <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2016.1157483>). The
  method can be applied to either regularly or irregularly spaced data, including 1D, 2D, and 3D.
