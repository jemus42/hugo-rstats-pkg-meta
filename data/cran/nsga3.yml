description: |-
  An adaptation of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III for multi objective
  feature selection tasks. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III is a genetic algorithm
  that solves multiple optimization problems simultaneously by applying a non-dominated sorting
  technique. It uses a reference points based selection operator to explore
  solution space and preserve diversity. See the original paper by K. Deb and
  H. Jain (2014) <DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281534> for a detailed description.
