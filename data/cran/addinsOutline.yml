  'RStudio' Addins for Show Outline of a R Markdown/'LaTeX'
  Project
maintainer: Pedro L. Luque-Calvo
description: |-
  'RStudio' allows to show and navigate for the outline of a
  R Markdown file, but not for R Markdown projects with multiple
  files. For this reason, I have developed several 'RStudio' addins capable
  of show project outline. Each addin is specialized in showing projects
  of different types: R Markdown project, 'bookdown' package project
  and 'LaTeX' project. There is a configuration file that allows you
  to customize additional searches.
