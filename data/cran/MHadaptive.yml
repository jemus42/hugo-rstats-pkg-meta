title: General Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference using<U+000a>adaptive
  Metropolis-Hastings sampling
maintainer: Corey Chivers
description: Performs general Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte<U+000a>Carlo
  sampling of a user defined function which returns the<U+000a>un-normalized value
  (likelihood times prior) of a Bayesian<U+000a>model.  The proposal variance-covariance
  structure is updated<U+000a>adaptively for efficient mixing when the structure of
  the<U+000a>target distribution is unknown.  The package also provides some<U+000a>functions
  for Bayesian inference including Bayesian Credible<U+000a>Intervals (BCI) and Deviance
  Information Criterion (DIC)<U+000a>calculation.
