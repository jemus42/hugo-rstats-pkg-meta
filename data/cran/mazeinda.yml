description: |-
  Methods for calculating and testing the significance of
  pairwise monotonic association from and based on the work of
  Pimentel (2009) <doi:10.4135/9781412985291.n2>. Computation of association of vectors from one
  or multiple sets can be performed in parallel thanks to the
  packages 'foreach' and 'doMC'.
