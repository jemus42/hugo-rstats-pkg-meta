  Extensible Classes and Methods for Penalized-Regression-Based
  Integration of Base Learners
maintainer: Alireza S. Mahani
description: Extending the base classes and methods of EnsembleBase package for Penalized-Regression-based
  (Ridge and Lasso) integration of base learners. Default implementation uses cross-validation
  error to choose the optimal lambda (shrinkage parameter) for the final predictor.
  The package takes advantage of the file method provided in EnsembleBase package
  for writing estimation objects to disk in order to circumvent RAM bottleneck. Special
  save and load methods are provided to allow estimation objects to be saved to permanent
  files on disk, and to be loaded again into temporary files in a later R session.
  Users and developers can extend the package by extending the generic methods and
  classes provided in EnsembleBase package as well as this package.
