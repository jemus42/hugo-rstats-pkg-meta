title: Fast Mutual Information Based Independence Test
maintainer: Shiyun Lin
description: A mutual information estimator based on k-nearest neighbor method proposed
  by A. Kraskov, et al. (2004) <doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138> to measure general
  dependence and the time complexity for our estimator is only squared to the sample
  size, which is faster than other statistics. Besides, an implementation of mutual
  information based independence test is provided for analyzing multivariate data
  in Euclidean space (T B. Berrett, et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asz024>); furthermore,
  we extend it to tackle datasets in metric spaces.
