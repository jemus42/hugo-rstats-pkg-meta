  A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
  Management
maintainer: Eliot J B McIntire
description: |-
  Collection of high-level, robust, machine- and OS-independent tools
  for making deeply reproducible and reusable content in R.
  The three workhorse functions are Cache, prepInputs, and Require;
  these allow for nested caching, robust to environments, and objects with
  environments (like functions), and data retrieval and processing, and
  package handling in continuous workflow environments. In all cases,
  efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of functions have
  the same result, but vastly faster at subsequent times by way of checksums
  and digesting. Several features are still under active development, including
  cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing between users.
