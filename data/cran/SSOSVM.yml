title: Stream Suitable Online Support Vector Machines
maintainer: Andrew Thomas Jones
description: Soft-margin support vector machines (SVMs) are a common class of classification
  models. The training of SVMs usually requires that the data be available all at
  once in a single batch, however the Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) algorithm
  framework allows for the training of SVMs on streamed data instead Nguyen, Jones
  & McLachlan(2018)<doi:10.1007/s42081-018-0001-y>. This package utilizes the SMM
  framework to provide functions for training SVMs with hinge loss, squared-hinge
  loss, and logistic loss.
