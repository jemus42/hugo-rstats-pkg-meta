title: Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis
maintainer: Francois Semecurbe
description: Performs Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis (GWFA) to calculate
  the local fractal dimension of a set of points. GWFA mixes the Sandbox multifractal
  algorithm and the Geographically Weighted Regression. Unlike fractal box-counting
  algorithm, the sandbox algorithm avoids border effects because the boxes are adjusted
  on the set of points. The Geographically Weighted approach consists in applying
  a kernel that describes the way the neighbourhood of each estimated point is taken
  into account to estimate its fractal dimension. GWFA can be used to discriminate
  built patterns of a city, a region, or a whole country.
