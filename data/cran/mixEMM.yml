  A Mixed-Effects Model for Analyzing Cluster-Level Non-Ignorable
  Missing Data
maintainer: Lin S. Chen
description: |-
  Contains functions for estimating a mixed-effects model for
  clustered data (or batch-processed data) with cluster-level (or batch-
  level) missing values in the outcome, i.e., the outcomes of some
  clusters are either all observed or missing altogether. The model is
  developed for analyzing incomplete data from labeling-based quantitative
  proteomics experiments but is not limited to this type of data.
  We used an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for model
  estimation. The cluster-level missingness may depend on the average
  value of the outcome in the cluster (missing not at random).
