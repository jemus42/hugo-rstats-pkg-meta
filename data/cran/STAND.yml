  Provides functions for the analysis of
  occupational and environmental data with non-detects. Maximum
  likelihood (ML) methods for censored log-normal data and
  non-parametric methods based on the product limit estimate (PLE)
  for left censored data are used to calculate all of the
  statistics recommended by the American Industrial Hygiene
  Association (AIHA) for the complete data case. Functions for
  the analysis of complete samples using exact methods are also
  provided for the lognormal model. Revised from 2007-11-05
