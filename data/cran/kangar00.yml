title: Kernel Approaches for Nonlinear Genetic Association Regression
maintainer: Juliane Manitz
description: 'Methods to extract information on pathways, genes and various single-nucleotid
  polymorphisms (SNPs) from online databases. It provides functions for data preparation
  and evaluation of genetic influence on a binary outcome using the logistic kernel
  machine test (LKMT). Three different kernel functions are offered to analyze genotype
  information in this variance component test: A linear kernel, a size-adjusted kernel
  and a network-based kernel (Friedrichs et al., 2017, <doi:10.1155/2017/6742763>).'
