version: 0.3.0
title: Support for the 'Mathpix' API (Image to 'LaTeX')
maintainer: Jonathan Carroll
description: |-
  Given an image of a formula (typeset or handwritten) this package
  provides calls to the 'Mathpix' service to produce the 'LaTeX' code which should
  generate that image, and pastes it into a (e.g. an 'rmarkdown') document.
  See <https://docs.mathpix.com/> for full details. 'Mathpix' is an external service
  and use of the API is subject to their terms and conditions.
