title: Statistical Inference for Partially Observed Markov Processes
maintainer: Aaron A. King
description: Tools for data analysis with partially observed Markov process (POMP)
  models (also known as stochastic dynamical systems, hidden Markov models, and nonlinear,
  non-Gaussian, state-space models).  The package provides facilities for implementing
  POMP models, simulating them, and fitting them to time series data by a variety
  of frequentist and Bayesian methods.  It is also a versatile platform for implementation
  of inference methods for general POMP models.
