title: Datasets to Align Financial Markets with Climate Goals
maintainer: Mauro Lepore
description: |-
  These datasets support the implementation in R of
  the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
  which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
  assets and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
  Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
  allocation impacts the climate. Because both financial institutions
  and market data providers keep their data private, this package
  provides fake, public data to enable the development and use of
  'PACTA' in R.
