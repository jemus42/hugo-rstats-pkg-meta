title: Bayesian Projected Normal Regression Models for Circular Data
maintainer: Jolien Cremers
description: |-
  Fitting Bayesian multiple and mixed-effect regression models for
  circular data based on the projected normal distribution. Both continuous
  and categorical predictors can be included. Sampling from the posterior is
  performed via an MCMC algorithm. Posterior descriptives of all parameters,
  model fit statistics and Bayes factors for hypothesis tests for inequality
  constrained hypotheses are provided. See Cremers, Mulder & Klugkist (2018)
