  Multi-Label Prediction Using Gibbs Sampling (and Classifier
  Chains)
maintainer: Mikhail Popov
description: |-
  An implementation of classifier chains (CC's) for multi-label
  prediction. Users can employ an external package (e.g. 'randomForest',
  'C50'), or supply their own. The package can train a single set of CC's or
  train an ensemble of CC's -- in parallel if running in a multi-core
  environment. New observations are classified using a Gibbs sampler since
  each unobserved label is conditioned on the others. The package includes
  methods for evaluating the predictions for accuracy and aggregating across
  iterations and models to produce binary or probabilistic classifications.
