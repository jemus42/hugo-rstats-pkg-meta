title: Variable Selection for Gaussian Model-Based Clustering
maintainer: Luca Scrucca
description: Variable selection for Gaussian model-based clustering as implemented
  in the 'mclust' package. The methodology allows to find the (locally) optimal subset
  of variables in a data set that have group/cluster information. A greedy or headlong
  search can be used, either in a forward-backward or backward-forward direction,
  with or without sub-sampling at the hierarchical clustering stage for starting 'mclust'
  models. By default the algorithm uses a sequential search, but parallelisation is
  also available.
