  Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares Robust to Missing
  Samples for Mono and Multi-Block Data Sets
maintainer: Hadrien Lorenzo
description: |-
  Allows to build Multi-Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares models. Multi-blocks with
  high-dimensional settings are particularly sensible to this. It comes with visualization
  functions and uses 'Rcpp' functions for fast computations and 'doParallel' to parallelize cross-validation.
  This is based on H Lorenzo, J Saracco, R Thiebaut (2019) <arXiv:1901.04380>.
  Many applications have been successfully realized.
