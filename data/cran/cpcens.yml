title: Changepoint Analysis using Censored Time Series Data
maintainer: Sajid Ali<sajidali@qau.edu.pk>
description: To detect the changepoint, this package uses most recent changepoint,
  double cumulative sum binary segmentation, multiple changepoints in multivariate
  time series, analyzing each series in the panel independently, and analyzing aggregated
  data methods. This package is useful to simulate censored time series to detect
  the most recent changepoint in censored panel data as well as to assess prediction
  accuracy.
