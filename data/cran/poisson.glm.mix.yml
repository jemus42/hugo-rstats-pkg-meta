title: Fit high dimensional mixtures of Poisson GLMs
maintainer: Panagiotis Papastamoulis
description: High dimensional mixtures of Poisson Generalized Linear models with three
  different parameterizations of Poisson means are considered. Moreover, partitioning
  the response variables into a set of blocks is possible. The package estimates parameters
  via EM algorithm. For an efficient initialization, a random splitting small-EM is
  introduced.
