maintainer: Jaroslav Kuchar
description: |-
  Provides implementations of a classifier based on the
  "Classification Based on Associations" (CBA). It can be used for building
  classification models from association rules. Rules are pruned in the order of
  precedence given by the sort criteria and a default rule is added. The final
  classifier labels provided instances. CBA was originally proposed by Liu,
  B. Hsu, W. and Ma, Y. Integrating Classification and Association Rule
  Mining. Proceedings KDD-98, New York, 27-31 August. AAAI. pp80-86 (1998, ISBN:1-57735-070-7).
