title: Select Features Reliably with Cohen's Effect Sizes
maintainer: Lang Ho Lee
description: Functions using Cohen's effect sizes (Cohen, Jacob. Statistical power
  analysis for the behavioral sciences. Academic press, 2013) are provided for reliable
  feature selection in biology data analysis.  In addition to Cohen's effect sizes,
  p-values are calculated and adjusted from quasi-Poisson GLM, negative binomial GLM
  and Normal distribution ANOVA.  Significant features (genes, RNAs or proteins) are
  selected by adjusted p-value and minimum Cohen's effect sizes, calculated to keep
  certain level of statistical power of biology data analysis given p-value threshold
  and sample size.
