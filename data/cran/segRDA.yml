title: Modeling Non-Continuous Linear Responses of Ecological Data
maintainer: Danilo C Vieira
description: 'Tools for modeling non-continuous linear responses of ecological communities
  to environmental data. The package is straightforward through three steps: (1) data
  ordering (function OrdData()), (2) split-moving-window analysis (function SMW())
  and (3) piecewise redundancy analysis (function pwRDA()). Relevant references include
  Cornelius and Reynolds (1991) <doi:10.2307/1941559> and Legendre and Legendre (2012,
  ISBN: 9780444538697).'
