title: Optimal Thresholding Fisher's P-Value Combination Method
maintainer: Hong Zhang
description: |-
  We provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF),
  quantile, and statistical power calculator for a collection of
  thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including Fisher's
  p-value combination method, truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding
  Fisher's p-value combination method which is proven to be optimal in some
  context of signal detection. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version
  of these tests are also included. For reference, please see Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu. "TFisher Tests: Optimal and Adaptive Thresholding for Combining p-Values", submitted.
