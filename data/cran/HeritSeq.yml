title: Heritability of Gene Expression for Next-Generation Sequencing
maintainer: W. Jenny Shi
description: |-
  Statistical framework to analyze heritability of gene expression
  based on next-generation sequencing data and simulating sequencing reads.
  Variance partition coefficients (VPC) are computed using linear mixed effects
  and generalized linear mixed effects models. Compound Poisson and negative
  binomial models are included. Reference: Rudra, Pratyaydipta, et al. "Model based heritability scores for high-throughput sequencing data." BMC bioinformatics 18.1 (2017): 143.
