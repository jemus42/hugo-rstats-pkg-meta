title: High Precision Swiss Ephemeris
maintainer: Ralf Stubner
description: |-
  The Swiss Ephemeris (version 2.08) is a high precision ephemeris based upon the
  DE431 ephemerides from NASA's JPL. It covers the time range 13201 BCE to
  17191 CE. This package uses the semi-analytic theory by Steve Moshier.
  For faster and more accurate calculations, the compressed Swiss Ephemeris
  data is available in the 'swephRdata' package. To access this data package,
  run 'install.packages("swephRdata", repos = "https://rstub.github.io/drat/",
  type = "source")'. The size of the 'swephRdata' package is approximately
  115 MB. The user can also use the original JPL DE431 data.
