title: Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models
maintainer: Roman Minguez
description: |-
  A collection of functions to test and estimate Seemingly
  Unrelated Regression (usually called SUR) models, with spatial structure, by maximum
  likelihood and three-stage least squares. The package estimates the
  most common spatial specifications, that is, SUR with Spatial Lag of
  X regressors (called SUR-SLX), SUR with Spatial Lag Model (called SUR-SLM),
  SUR with Spatial Error Model (called SUR-SEM), SUR with Spatial Durbin Model (called SUR-SDM),
  SUR with Spatial Durbin Error Model (called SUR-SDEM),
  SUR with Spatial Autoregressive terms and Spatial Autoregressive
  Disturbances (called SUR-SARAR) and SUR with Spatially Independent Model (called SUR-SIM).
  The methodology of these models can be found in next references
