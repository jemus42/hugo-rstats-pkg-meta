title: Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation
maintainer: John Muschelli
description: |-
  An implementation of Simultaneous Truth and
  Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) <doi:10.1109/TMI.2004.828354>.  This
  method is used when there are multiple raters for an object, typically an
  image, and this method fuses these ratings into one rating.  It uses an
  expectation-maximization method to estimate this rating and the individual
  specificity/sensitivity for each rater.
