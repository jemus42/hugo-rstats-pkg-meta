title: SNPs-based whole genome association studies
maintainer: Juan R Gonz√°lez
description: This package carries out most common analysis when performing whole genome
  association studies. These analyses include descriptive statistics and exploratory
  analysis of missing values, calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis
  of association based on generalized linear models (either for quantitative or binary
  traits), and analysis of multiple SNPs (haplotype and epistasis analysis). Permutation
  test and related tests (sum statistic and truncated product) are also implemented.
  Max-statistic and genetic risk-allele score exact distributions are also possible
  to be estimated.
