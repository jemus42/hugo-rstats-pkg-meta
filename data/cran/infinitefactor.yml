title: Bayesian Infinite Factor Models
maintainer: Evan Poworoznek
description: Sampler and post-processing functions for semi-parametric Bayesian infinite
  factor models, motivated by the Multiplicative Gamma Shrinkage Prior of Bhattacharya
  and Dunson (2011) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3419391/>. Contains
  component C++ functions for building samplers for linear and 2-way interaction factor
  models using the multiplicative gamma and Dirichlet-Laplace shrinkage priors. The
  package also contains post processing functions to return matrices that display
  rotational ambiguity to identifiability through successive application of orthogonalization
  procedures and resolution of column label and sign switching. This package was developed
  with the support of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences grant
  1R01ES028804-01.
