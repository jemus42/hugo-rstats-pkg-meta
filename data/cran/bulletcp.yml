  Automatic Groove Identification via Bayesian Changepoint
  Detection
maintainer: Nathaniel Garton
description: |-
  Provides functionality to automatically detect groove locations via a Bayesian changepoint detection method to be used in the data preprocessing step
  of forensic bullet matching algorithms. The methods in this package are based on those in Stephens (1994) <doi:10.2307/2986119>. Bayesian changepoint detection will simply be an option
  in the function from the package 'bulletxtrctr' which identifies the groove locations.
