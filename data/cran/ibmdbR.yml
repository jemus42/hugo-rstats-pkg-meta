description: |2-

  Functionality required to efficiently use R with IBM(R) Db2(R)
  Warehouse offerings (formerly IBM dashDB(R)) and IBM Db2 for z/OS(R) in
  conjunction with IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS.
  Many basic and complex R operations are pushed down into the database,
  which removes the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full
  use of parallel processing in the underlying database.
