title: General Linear Ballistic Accumulator Models
maintainer: Ingmar Visser
description: Analyses response times and accuracies from psychological experiments
  with the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model from Brown and Heathcote (2008).
  The LBA model is optionally fitted with explanatory variables on the parameters
  such as the drift rate, the boundary and the starting point parameters. A log-link
  function on the linear predictors can be used to ensure that parameters remain positive
  when needed.
