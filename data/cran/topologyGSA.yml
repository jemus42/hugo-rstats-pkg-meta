title: Gene Set Analysis Exploiting Pathway Topology
maintainer: Gabriele Sales
description: |-
  Using Gaussian graphical models we propose a novel approach to
  perform pathway analysis using gene expression. Given the
  structure of a graph (a pathway) we introduce two statistical
  tests to compare the mean and the concentration matrices between
  two groups. Specifically, these tests can be performed on the
  graph and on its connected components (cliques).
