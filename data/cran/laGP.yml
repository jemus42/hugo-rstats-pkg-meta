title: Local Approximate Gaussian Process Regression
maintainer: Robert B. Gramacy
description: Performs approximate GP regression for large computer experiments and
  spatial datasets.  The approximation is based on finding small local designs for
  prediction (independently) at particular inputs. OpenMP and SNOW parallelization
  are supported for prediction over a vast out-of-sample testing set; GPU acceleration
  is also supported for an important subroutine.  OpenMP and GPU features may require
  special compilation.  An interface to lower-level (full) GP inference and prediction
  is provided. Wrapper routines for blackbox optimization under mixed equality and
  inequality constraints via an augmented Lagrangian scheme, and for large scale computer
  model calibration, are also provided.
