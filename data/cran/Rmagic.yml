title: MAGIC - Markov Affinity-Based Graph Imputation of Cells
maintainer: Scott Gigante
description: 'MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells) is a method
  for addressing technical noise in single-cell data, including under-sampling of
  mRNA molecules, often termed "dropout" which can severely obscure important gene-gene
  relationships. MAGIC shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion,
  to denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. Read more: van
