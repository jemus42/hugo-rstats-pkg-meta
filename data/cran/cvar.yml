  Compute Expected Shortfall and Value at Risk for Continuous
  Distributions
maintainer: Georgi N. Boshnakov
description: |-
  Compute expected shortfall (ES) and Value at Risk (VaR) from a
  quantile function, distribution function, random number generator or
  probability density function.  ES is also known as Conditional Value at
  Risk (CVaR). Virtually any continuous distribution can be specified.
  The functions are vectorized over the arguments. The computations are
  done directly from the definitions, see e.g. Acerbi and Tasche (2002)
  <doi:10.1111/1468-0300.00091>. Some support for GARCH models is provided,
  as well.
