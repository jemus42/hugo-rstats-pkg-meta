  Statistical Inference for Online Learning and Stochastic
  Approximation via HiGrad
maintainer: Yuancheng Zhu
description: |-
  Implements the Hierarchical Incremental GRAdient Descent (HiGrad) algorithm,
  a first-order algorithm for finding the minimizer of a function in online learning just like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
  In addition, this method attaches a confidence interval to assess the uncertainty of its predictions.
  See Su and Zhu (2018) <arXiv:1802.04876> for details.
