title: Bayesian Analysis of Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models
maintainer: Ethan Alt
description: |-
  Implementation of the direct Monte Carlo approach of
  Zellner and Ando (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2010.04.005>
  to sample from posterior of
  Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models. In
  addition, a Gibbs sampler is implemented that allows
  the user to analyze SUR models using the power prior.
