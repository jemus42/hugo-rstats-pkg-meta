title: Discrete Distribution Approximations
maintainer: Steph Locke
description: |-
  Creates discretised versions of continuous
  distribution functions by mapping continuous values
  to an underlying discrete grid, based on a (uniform)
  frequency of discretisation, a valid discretisation
  point, and an integration range. For a review of
  discretisation methods, see
  Chakraborty (2015) <doi:10.1186/s40488-015-0028-6>.
