  Shape-Constrained Additive Regression: a Maximum Likelihood
  Approach
maintainer: Yining Chen
description: 'This package computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the generalised
  additive and index regression with shape constraints. Each additive component function
  is assumed to obey one of the nine possible shape restrictions: linear, increasing,
  decreasing, convex, convex increasing, convex decreasing, concave, concave increasing,
  or concave decreasing.'
