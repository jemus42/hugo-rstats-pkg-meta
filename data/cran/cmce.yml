  Computer Model Calibration for Deterministic and Stochastic
  Simulators
maintainer: Matthew T. Pratola
description: |-
  Implements the Bayesian calibration model described
  in Pratola and Chkrebtii (2018) <DOI:10.5705/ss.202016.0403> for stochastic
  and deterministic simulators.  Additive and multiplicative discrepancy models
  are currently supported. See <http://www.matthewpratola.com/software> for
  more information and examples.
