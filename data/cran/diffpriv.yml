title: Easy Differential Privacy
maintainer: Benjamin Rubinstein
description: |-
  An implementation of major general-purpose mechanisms for privatizing
  statistics, models, and machine learners, within the framework of differential
  privacy of Dwork et al. (2006) <doi:10.1007/11681878_14>. Example mechanisms
  include the Laplace mechanism for releasing numeric aggregates, and the
  exponential mechanism for releasing set elements. A sensitivity sampler
  (Rubinstein & Alda, 2017) <arXiv:1706.02562> permits sampling target
  non-private function sensitivity; combined with the generic mechanisms, it
  permits turn-key privatization of arbitrary programs.
