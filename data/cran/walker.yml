description: |-
  Bayesian generalized linear models with time-varying coefficients.
  Gaussian, Poisson, and binomial observations are supported.
  The Markov chain Monte Carlo computations are done using
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provided by Stan, using a state space representation
  of the model in order to marginalise over the coefficients for efficient sampling.
  For non-Gaussian models, the package uses the importance sampling type estimators based on
  approximate marginal MCMC as in Vihola, Helske, Franks (2017, <arXiv:1609.02541>).
