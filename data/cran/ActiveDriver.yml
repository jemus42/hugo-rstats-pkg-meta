  Finding Cancer Driver Proteins with Enriched Mutations in
  Post-Translational Modification Sites
maintainer: Juri Reimand
description: 'A mutation analysis tool that discovers cancer driver genes with frequent
  mutations in protein signalling sites such as post-translational modifications (phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, etc). The Poisson generalised linear regression model identifies
  genes where cancer mutations in signalling sites are more frequent than expected
  from the sequence of the entire gene. Integration of mutations with signalling information
  helps find new driver genes and propose candidate mechanisms to known drivers. Reference:

  cancer drivers. Juri Reimand and Gary D Bader. Molecular Systems Biology (2013)
