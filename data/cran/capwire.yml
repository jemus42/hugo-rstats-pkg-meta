title: Estimates population size from non-invasive sampling
maintainer: Matthew W. Pennell
description: Fits models from Miller et al. 2005 to estimate population<U+000a>sizes
  from natural populations. Several models are implemented.<U+000a>Package also includes
  functions to perform a likelihood ratio<U+000a>test to choose between models, perform
  parametric bootstrapping<U+000a>to obtain confidence intervals and multiple functions
