  Dams in the United States from the National Inventory of Dams

description: |-
  The single largest source of dams in the United States is the
  National Inventory of Dams (NID) <http://nid.usace.army.mil> from the US
  Army Corps of Engineers. Entire data from the NID cannot be obtained all at
  once and NID's website limits extraction of more than a couple of thousand
  records at a time. Moreover, selected data from the NID's user interface
  cannot not be saved to a file. In order to make the analysis of this data
  easier, all the data from NID was extracted manually. Subsequently, the raw
  data was checked for potential errors and cleaned. This package provides
  sample cleaned data from the NID and provides functionality to access the
  entire cleaned NID data.
