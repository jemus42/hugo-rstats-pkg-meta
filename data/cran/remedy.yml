title: '''RStudio'' Addins to Simplify ''Markdown'' Writing'
maintainer: Colin Fay
description: |-
  An 'RStudio' addin providing shortcuts for writing in 'Markdown'. This package provides a series of
  functions that allow the user to be more efficient when using 'Markdown'. For example, you can select
  a word, and put it in bold or in italics, or change the alignment of elements inside you Rmd. The idea
  is to map all the functionalities from 'remedy' on keyboard shortcuts, so that it provides an interface
  close to what you can find in any other text editor.
