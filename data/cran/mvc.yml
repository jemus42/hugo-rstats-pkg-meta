maintainer: Andreas Maunz
description: An implementation of Multi-View Clustering (Bickel and Scheffer, 2004).
  Documents are generated by drawing word values from a categorical distribution for
  each word, given the cluster. This means words are not counted (multinomial, as
  in the paper), but words take on different values from a finite set of values (categorical).
  Thus, it implements Mixture of Categoricals EM (as opposed to Mixture of Multinomials
  developed in the paper), and Spherical k-Means. The latter represents documents
  as vectors in the categorical space.
