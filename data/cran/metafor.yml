title: Meta-Analysis Package for R
maintainer: Wolfgang Viechtbauer
description: A comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses
  in R. The package includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome
  measures, fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out
  moderator and meta-regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical
  plots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat, GOSH plots). For meta-analyses
  of binomial and person-time data, the package also provides functions that implement
  specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a
  variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects
  logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally, the package provides functionality
  for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent
  sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment
  studies, multiple endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses
  and meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic
  relatedness) can also be conducted.
