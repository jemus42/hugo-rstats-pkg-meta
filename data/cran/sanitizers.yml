  C/C++ source code to trigger Address and Undefined Behaviour
  Sanitizers
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  Recent gcc and clang compiler versions provide functionality to
  memory violations and other undefined behaviour; this is often referred to as
  "Address Sanitizer" (or SAN) and "Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer" (UBSAN).
  The Writing R Extension manual describes this in some detail in Section 4.9.

  This feature has to be enabled in the corresponding binary, eg in R, which
  is somewhat involved as it also required a current compiler toolchain which
  is not yet widely available, or in the case of Windows, not available at all
  (via the common Rtools mechanism).

  As an alternative, the pre-built Docker containers available via the Docker Hub
  at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/eddelbuettel/docker-debian-r/ can be used
  on Linux, and via boot2docker on Windows and OS X.

  This package then provides a means of testing the compiler setup as the
  known code failures provides in the sample code here should be detected
  correctly, whereas a default build of R will let the package pass.

  The code samples are based on the examples from the Address Sanitizer
  Wiki at https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer.
