title: Average Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL)
maintainer: Helmut Sch√ºtz
description: |-
  Performs comparative bioavailability calculations for Average Bioequivalence with
  Expanding Limits (ABEL). Implemented are 'Method A' and 'Method B' and the detection of outliers.
  If the design allows, assessment of the empiric Type I Error and iteratively adjusting alpha to
  control the consumer risk.
  Average Bioequivalence - optionally with a tighter (narrow therapeutic index drugs) or wider
  acceptance range (Gulf Cooperation Council, South Africa: Cmax) - is implemented as well.
