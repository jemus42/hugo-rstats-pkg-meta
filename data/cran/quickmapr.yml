title: Quickly Map and Explore Spatial Data
maintainer: Jeffrey W. Hollister
description: |-
  While analyzing geospatial data, easy visualization is often
  needed that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
  Additionally, visualizing geospatial data in projected coordinates is also
  desirable. The 'quickmapr' package provides a simple method to visualize
  'sp', 'sf' (via coercion to 'sp'), and 'raster' objects, allows for basic
  zooming, panning, identifying,labeling, selecting, and measuring spatial
  objects.  Importantly, it does not require that the data be in geographic
  coordinates.
