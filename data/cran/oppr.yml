title: Optimal Project Prioritization
maintainer: Jeffrey O Hanson
description: |-
  A decision support tool for prioritizing conservation projects.
  Prioritizations can be developed by maximizing expected feature richness,
  expected phylogenetic diversity, the number of features that meet
  persistence targets, or identifying a set of projects that meet persistence
  targets for minimal cost. Constraints (e.g. lock in specific actions) and
  feature weights can also be specified to further customize prioritizations.
  After defining a project prioritization problem, solutions can be obtained
  using exact algorithms, heuristic algorithms, or random processes. In
  particular, it is recommended to install the 'Gurobi' optimizer (available
  from <https://www.gurobi.com>) because it can identify optimal solutions
  very quickly. Finally, methods are provided for comparing different
  prioritizations and evaluating their benefits. For more information, see
  Hanson et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13264>.
