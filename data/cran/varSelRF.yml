title: Variable Selection using Random Forests
maintainer: Ramon Diaz-Uriarte
description: |-
  Variable selection from random forests using both
  backwards variable elimination (for the selection of small sets
  of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the
  importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the
  selection of large, potentially highly-correlated variables).
  Main applications in high-dimensional data (e.g., microarray
  data, and other genomics and proteomics applications).
