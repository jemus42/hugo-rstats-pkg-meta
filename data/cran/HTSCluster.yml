title: Clustering High-Throughput Transcriptome Sequencing (HTS) Data
maintainer: Andrea Rau
description: |-
  A Poisson mixture model is implemented to cluster genes from high-
  throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Parameter estimation is
  performed using either the EM or CEM algorithm, and the slope heuristics are
  used for model selection (i.e., to choose the number of clusters).
