title: Estimation and Simulation for PDMPs
maintainer: Romain Azais
description: This package deals with the estimation of the jump rate for piecewise-deterministic
  Markov processes (PDMPs), from only one observation of the process within a long
  time. The main functions provide an estimate of this function. The state space may
  be discrete or continuous. The associated paper has been published in Scandinavian
  Journal of Statistics and is given in references. Other functions provide a method
  to simulate random variables from their (conditional) hazard rate, and then to simulate
  PDMPs.
