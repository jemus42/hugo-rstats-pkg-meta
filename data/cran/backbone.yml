title: Extracts the Backbone from Weighted Graphs
maintainer: Rachel Domagalski
description: |-
  Provides methods for extracting from a weighted graph
  a binary or signed backbone that retains only the significant edges.
  The user may input a weighted graph, or a bipartite graph
  from which a weighted graph is first constructed via projection.
  Backbone extraction methods include the stochastic degree sequence model (Neal, Z. P. (2014). <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2014.06.001>),
  hypergeometric model (Neal, Z. (2013). <doi:10.1007/s13278-013-0107-y>),
  the fixed degree sequence model (Zweig, K. A., and Kaufmann, M. (2011). <doi:10.1007/s13278-011-0021-0>),
  as well as a universal threshold method.
