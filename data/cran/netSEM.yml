description: |-
  The network structural equation modeling conducts a network statistical analysis
  on a data frame of coincident observations of multiple continuous variables [1].
  It builds a pathway model by exploring a pool of domain knowledge guided candidate statistical
  relationships between each of the variable pairs, selecting the 'best fit' on
  the basis of a specific criteria such as adjusted r-squared value.
