title: 'Side Effect Risks in Hospital : Simulation and Estimation'
maintainer: Christophe Dutang
description: Evaluating risk (that a patient arises a side effect) during hospitalization
  is the main purpose of this package. Several methods (Parametric, non parametric
  and De Vielder estimation) to estimate the risk constant (R) are implemented in
  this package. There are also functions to simulate the different models of this
  issue in order to quantify the previous estimators. It is necessary to read at least
  the first six pages of the report to understand the topic.
