title: Optimal, Fast, and Reproducible Univariate Clustering
maintainer: Joe Song
description: |-
  Fast, optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate
  clustering by dynamic programming. Four types of problem including
  univariate k-means, k-median, k-segments, and multi-channel
  weighted k-means are solved with guaranteed optimality and
  reproducibility. The core algorithm minimizes the sum of (weighted)
  within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its advantage
  over heuristic clustering in efficiency and accuracy is pronounced
  at a large number of clusters k. Weighted k-means can also process
  time series to perform peak calling. Multi-channel weighted k-means
  groups multiple univariate signals into k clusters. An auxiliary
  function generates histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data.
  This package provides a powerful set of tools for univariate data
  analysis with guaranteed optimality, efficiency, and reproducibility.
