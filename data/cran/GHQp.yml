title: Gauss Hermite Quadrature with pruning.
maintainer: Freddy Hernandez Barajas
description: The GHQ function can be used to obtain the quadrature points and weights
  to approximate an integral in two or more dimensions. This function uses the pruning
  approach to eliminate that points that do not contribute to the approximation of
  the integral and increases computational cost. The advantage to conducting this
  elimination of points is the decrease in the number of times that the function of
  interest is evaluated. This advantage is crucial in mixed models in which we must
  address several integrations within an iterative process to obtain model parameters.
