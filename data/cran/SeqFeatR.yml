title: A Tool to Associate FASTA Sequences and Features
maintainer: Bettina Budeus
description: Provides user friendly methods for the identification of sequence patterns
  that are statistically significantly associated with a property of the sequence.
  For instance, SeqFeatR allows to identify viral immune escape mutations for hosts
  of given HLA types. The underlying statistical method is Fisher's exact test, with
  appropriate corrections for multiple testing, or Bayes. Patterns may be point mutations
  or n-tuple of mutations. SeqFeatR offers several ways to visualize the results of
  the statistical analyses, see Budeus (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0146409>.
