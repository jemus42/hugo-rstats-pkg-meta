description: Cluster analysis for cognitive diagnosis based on the Asymptotic Classification
  Theory (Chiu, Douglas & Li, 2009; <doi:10.1007/s11336-009-9125-0>). Given the sample
  statistic of sum-scores, cluster analysis techniques can be used to classify examinees
  into latent classes based on their attribute patterns. In addition to the algorithms
  used to classify data, three labeling approaches are proposed to label clusters
  so that examinees' attribute profiles can be obtained.
