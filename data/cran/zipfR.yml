title: Statistical Models for Word Frequency Distributions
maintainer: Stefan Evert
description: |-
  Statistical models and utilities for the analysis of word frequency distributions.
  The utilities include functions for loading, manipulating and visualizing word frequency
  data and vocabulary growth curves.  The package also implements several statistical
  models for the distribution of word frequencies in a population.  (The name of this package
  derives from the most famous word frequency distribution, Zipf's law.)
