title: Bagging with Distance-based Regression for Differential Gene<U+000a>Expression
  Analyses
maintainer: Yaomin Xu
description: This package implements a statistical data mining method to<U+000a>compare
  whole genome gene expression profiles, with respect to the presence<U+000a>of a
  recurrent genetic disturbance event, to identify the affected target<U+000a>genes.
