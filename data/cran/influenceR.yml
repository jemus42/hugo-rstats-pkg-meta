  Software Tools to Quantify Structural Importance of Nodes in a
  Network
maintainer: Khanna Aditya
description: |-
  Provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks.
  Included are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader's
  SNAP library), implementations of Burt's constraint and effective
  network size (ENS) metrics, Borgatti's algorithm to identify key players, and Valente's
  bridging metric. On Unix systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and
  bridging implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may run
  faster on systems which have OpenMP configured.
