title: A Tool for Downloading Functional Traits Data for Plant Species
maintainer: Gionata Bocci
description: |-
  Plant ecologists often need to collect "traits" data
  about plant species which are often scattered among various
  databases: TR8 contains a set of tools which take care of
  automatically retrieving some of those functional traits data
  for plant species from publicly available databases (Biolflor,
  The Ecological Flora of the British Isles, LEDA traitbase, Ellenberg
  values for Italian Flora, Mycorrhizal intensity databases, Catminat, BROT,
  PLANTS, Jepson Flora Project).
  The TR8 name, inspired by "car plates" jokes, was chosen since
  it both reminds of the main object of the package and is
  extremely short to type.
