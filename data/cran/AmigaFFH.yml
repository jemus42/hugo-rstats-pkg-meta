version: 0.3.1
title: Commodore Amiga File Format Handler
maintainer: Pepijn de Vries
description: |-
  Modern software often poorly support older file formats. This
  package intends to handle many file formats that were native to the
  antiquated Commodore Amiga machine. This package focuses on file types from
  the older Amiga operating systems (<= 3.0). It will read and write specific
  file formats and coerces them into more contemporary data.
