maintainer: Brian J Smith
description: |-
  Meta-package for statistical and machine learning with a unified
  interface for model fitting, prediction, performance assessment, and
  presentation of results.  Approaches for model fitting and prediction of
  numerical, categorical, or censored time-to-event outcomes include
  traditional regression models, regularization methods, tree-based methods,
  support vector machines, neural networks, ensembles, data preprocessing,
  filtering, and model tuning and selection.  Performance metrics are provided
  for model assessment and can be estimated with independent test sets, split
  sampling, cross-validation, or bootstrap resampling.  Resample estimation
  can be executed in parallel for faster processing and nested in cases of
  model tuning and selection.  Modeling results can be summarized with
  descriptive statistics; calibration curves; variable importance; partial
  dependence plots; confusion matrices; and ROC, lift, and other performance
  curves.
