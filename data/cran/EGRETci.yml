description: |-
  Collection of functions to evaluate uncertainty of results from
  water quality analysis using the Weighted Regressions on Time Discharge and
  Season (WRTDS) method. This package is an add-on to the EGRET package that
  performs the WRTDS analysis. The WRTDS modeling
  method was initially introduced and discussed in Hirsch et al. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00482.x>,
  and expanded in Hirsch and De Cicco (2015) <doi:10.3133/tm4A10>. The
  paper describing the uncertainty and confidence interval calculations
  is Hirsch et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.07.017>.
