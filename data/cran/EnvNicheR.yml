maintainer: Cástor Guisande González
description: 'A plot overlying the niche of multiple species is obtained: 1) to determine
  the niche conditions which favor a higher species richness, 2) to create a box plot
  with the range of environmental variables of the species, 3) to obtain a list of
  species in an area of the niche selected by the user and, 4) to estimate niche overlap
  among the species.'
