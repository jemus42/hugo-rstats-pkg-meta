  Tools for 2D and 3D Plots of Single and Multi-Objective
  Linear/Integer Programming Models
maintainer: Lars Relund Nielsen
description: |-
  Make 2D and 3D plots of linear programming (LP),
  integer linear programming (ILP), or mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models
  with up to three objectives. Plots of both the solution and criterion space are possible.
  For instance the non-dominated (Pareto) set for bi-objective LP/ILP/MILP programming models
  (see vignettes for an overview).
