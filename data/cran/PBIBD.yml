title: Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Designs
maintainer: Kush Sharma
description: The PBIB designs are important type of incomplete block designs having
  wide area of their applications for example in agricultural experiments, in plant
  breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package constructs various series of PBIB
  designs and assists in checking all the necessary conditions of PBIB designs and
  the association scheme on which these designs are based on. It also assists in calculating
  the efficiencies of PBIB designs with any number of associate classes. The package
  also constructs Youden-m square designs which are Row-Column designs for the two-way
  elimination of heterogeneity. The incomplete columns of these Youden-m square designs
  constitute PBIB designs. With the present functionality, the package will be of
  immense importance for the researchers as it will help them to construct PBIB designs,
  to check if their PBIB designs and association scheme satisfy various necessary
  conditions for the existence, to calculate the efficiencies of PBIB designs based
  on any association scheme and to construct Youden-m square designs for the two-way
  elimination of heterogeneity. R. C. Bose and K. R. Nair (1939) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/40383923>.
