  Quantitative Estimates of Small Ectotherm Temperature Regulation
  Effectiveness
maintainer: Wouter Beukema
description: 'Easy and rapid quantitative estimation of small terrestrial ectotherm
  temperature regulation effectiveness in R. ectotemp is built on classical formulas
  that evaluate temperature regulation by means of various indices, inaugurated by
  Hertz et al. (1993) <doi: 10.1086/285573>. Options for bootstrapping and permutation
  testing are included to test hypotheses about divergence between organisms, species
  or populations.'
