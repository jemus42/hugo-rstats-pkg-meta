title: Simulation Tools for Small Area Estimation
maintainer: Sebastian Warnholz
description: |-
  Tools for the simulation of data in the context of small area
  estimation. Combine all steps of your simulation - from data generation
  over drawing samples to model fitting - in one object. This enables easy
  modification and combination of different scenarios. You can store your
  results in a folder or start the simulation in parallel.
