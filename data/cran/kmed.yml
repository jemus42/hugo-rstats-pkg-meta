description: |-
  Algorithms of distance-based k-medoids clustering:
  simple and fast k-medoids, ranked k-medoids, and increasing number
  of clusters in k-medoids. Calculate distances for mixed variable
  data such as Gower, Podani, Wishart, Huang, Harikumar-PV, and
  Ahmad-Dey. Cluster validations apply internal and relative
  criteria. The internal criteria include silhouette index and
  shadow values. The relative criterium applies bootstrap procedure
  producing a heatmap with a flexible reordering matrix algorithm
  such as ward, complete, or centroid linkages. The cluster result
  can be plotted in a marked barplot or pca biplot.
