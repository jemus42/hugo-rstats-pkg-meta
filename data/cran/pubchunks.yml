title: Fetch Sections of XML Scholarly Articles
maintainer: Scott Chamberlain
description: |-
  Get chunks of XML scholarly articles without
  having to know how to work with XML. Custom mappers
  for each publisher and for each article section pull
  out the information you want. Works with outputs from
  package 'fulltext', 'xml2' package documents, and file paths to
  XML documents.
