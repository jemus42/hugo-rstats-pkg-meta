title: Detect and Test Regular Sequences and Subsequences
maintainer: Yanming Di<diy@stat.oregonstate.edu>
description: |-
  For a sequence of event occurence times, we are interested in
  finding subsequences in it that are too "regular". We define regular as being
  significantly different from a homogeneous Poisson process. The departure from
  the Poisson process is measured using a L1 distance. See Di and Perlman 2007
  for more details.
