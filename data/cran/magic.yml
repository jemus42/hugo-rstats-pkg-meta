title: Create and Investigate Magic Squares
maintainer: '"Robin K. S. Hankin"'
description: |-
  A collection of efficient, vectorized algorithms for the
  creation and investigation of magic squares and hypercubes, including
  a variety of functions for the manipulation and analysis of
  arbitrarily dimensioned arrays.  The package includes methods for
  creating normal magic squares of any order greater than 2.  The
  ultimate intention is for the package to be a computerized embodiment
  all magic square knowledge, including direct numerical verification
  of properties of magic squares (such as recent results on the
  determinant of odd-ordered semimagic squares).  Some antimagic
  functionality is included.  The package also
  serves as a rebuttal to the often-heard comment "I thought R
  was just for statistics".
