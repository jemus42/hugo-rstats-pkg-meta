title: Out of Bag Learning Curve
maintainer: Philipp Probst
description: Provides functions to calculate the out-of-bag learning curve for random
  forests for any measure that is available in the 'mlr' package. Supported random
  forest packages are 'randomForest' and 'ranger' and trained models of these packages
  with the train function of 'mlr'. The main function is OOBCurve() that calculates
  the out-of-bag curve depending on the number of trees. With the OOBCurvePars() function
  out-of-bag curves can also be calculated for 'mtry', 'sample.fraction' and 'min.node.size'
  for the 'ranger' package.
