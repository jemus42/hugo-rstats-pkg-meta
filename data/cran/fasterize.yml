version: 1.0.2
title: Fast Polygon to Raster Conversion
maintainer: Noam Ross
description: |-
  Provides a drop-in replacement for rasterize() from the 'raster'
  package that takes 'sf'-type objects, and is much faster. There is support
  for the main options provided by the rasterize() function, including
  setting the field used and background value, and options for
  aggregating multi-layer rasters. Uses the scan line algorithm attributed to
  Wylie et al. (1967) <doi:10.1145/1465611.1465619>.
