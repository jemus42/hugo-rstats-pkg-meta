title: Integrative Conditional Autoregressive Horseshoe Model
maintainer: Takoua Jendoubi
description: |-
  Implements the integrative conditional autoregressive horseshoe model
  discussed in Jendoubi, T., & Ebbels, T. (2018). "Integrative analysis of
  time course metabolic data and biomarker discovery". arXiv preprint <arXiv:1801.07767>.
  The model consists in three levels: Metabolic pathways level modeling interdependencies between
  variables via a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) component , integrative analysis level to identify
  potential associations between heterogeneous omic variables via a Horseshoe prior and experimental
  design level to capture experimental design conditions through a mixed-effects model.
  The package also provides functions to simulate data from the model, construct pathway matrices,
  post process and plot model parameters.
