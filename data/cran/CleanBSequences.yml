description: |-
  Cleans biological sequences massively, quickly, without errors and
  without internet connection.  Biological sequences cleaning is performed by
  aligning the forward and / or revers primers or ends of cloning vectors with the sequences
  to be cleaned. After the alignment, new subsequences are generated without biological fragment
  not desired by the user.
