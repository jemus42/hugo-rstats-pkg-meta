title: Utility Functions for Working with Random Number Generators
maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux
description: |-
  Provides a set of functions for working with
  Random Number Generators (RNGs). In particular, a generic
  S4 framework is defined for getting/setting the current RNG, or RNG data
  that are embedded into objects for reproducibility.
  Notably, convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way current
  RNG settings can be changed.
