  Both an 'Azure Resource Manager' interface, for deploying Cognitive Services resources,
  and a client framework are supplied. While 'AzureCognitive' can be called by the
  end-user, it is meant to provide a foundation for other packages that will support
  specific services, like Computer Vision, Custom Vision, language translation, and
  so on. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.
