  Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Satellite Image Time
  Series Analysis
maintainer: Victor Maus
description: |-
  Provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
  Warping (TWDTW) method for land cover mapping using satellite image time series.
  TWDTW compares unclassified satellite image time series with a set of known
  temporal patterns (e.g. phenological cycles associated with the vegetation).
  Using 'dtwSat' the user can build temporal patterns for land cover types, apply
  the TWDTW analysis for satellite datasets, visualize the results of the time
  series analysis, produce land cover maps, create temporal plots for land cover
  change, and compute accuracy assessment metrics.
