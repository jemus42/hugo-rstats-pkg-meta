title: Machine Learning in R
maintainer: Patrick Schratz
description: |-
  Interface to a large number of classification and
  regression techniques, including machine-readable parameter
  descriptions. There is also an experimental extension for survival
  analysis, clustering and general, example-specific cost-sensitive
  learning. Generic resampling, including cross-validation,
  bootstrapping and subsampling. Hyperparameter tuning with modern
  optimization techniques, for single- and multi-objective problems.
  Filter and wrapper methods for feature selection. Extension of basic
  learners with additional operations common in machine learning, also
  allowing for easy nested resampling. Most operations can be
  parallelized.
