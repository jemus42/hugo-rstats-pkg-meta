title: The p-Generalized Normal Distribution
maintainer: Steve Kalke
description: |-
  Evaluation of the pdf and the cdf of the univariate,
  noncentral, p-generalized normal distribution. Sampling from
  the univariate, noncentral, p-generalized normal distribution
  using either the p-generalized polar method, the p-generalized
  rejecting polar method, the Monty Python method, the Ziggurat
  method or the method of Nardon and Pianca. The package also
  includes routines for the simulation of the bivariate,
  p-generalized uniform distribution and the simulation of the
  corresponding angular distribution.
