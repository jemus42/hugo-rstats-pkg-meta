title: Determination of K Using Peak Counts of Features for Clustering
maintainer: Zeynel Cebeci
description: The number of clusters (k) is needed to start all the partitioning clustering
  algorithms. An optimal value of this input argument is widely determined by using
  some internal validity indices. Since most of the existing internal indices suggest
  a k value which is computed from the clustering results after several runs of a
  clustering algorithm they are computationally expensive. On the contrary,  the package
  'kpeaks' enables to estimate k before running any clustering algorithm. It is based
  on a simple novel technique using the descriptive statistics of peak counts of the
  features in a data set.
