  Fast and Stable Fitting of Generalized Linear Models using
  'RcppEigen'
maintainer: Jared Huling
description: |-
  Fits generalized linear models efficiently using 'RcppEigen'. The iteratively reweighted least squares
  implementation utilizes the step-halving approach of Marschner (2011) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-012> to help safeguard
  against convergence issues.
