version: 0.2.1
title: Function Errorizer
maintainer: Ian K. Kyle
description: |-
  Provides a function to convert existing R functions into "errorized" versions
  with added logging and handling functionality when encountering errors or warnings.
  The errorize function accepts an existing R function as its first argument and
  returns a R function with the exact same arguments and functionality. However,
  if an error or warning occurs when running that "errorized" R function, it will save a
  .Rds file to the current working directory with the relevant objects and information
  required to immediately recreate the error.
