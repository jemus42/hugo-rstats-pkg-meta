  Downloading YouTube Subtitle Transcription in a Tidy Tibble Data
  Frame
maintainer: JooYoung Seo
description: Although there exist some R packages tailored for YouTube API (e.g.,
  'tuber'), downloading YouTube video subtitle (i.e., caption) in a tidy form has
  never been a low-hanging fruit. Using 'youtube-transcript-api Python package' under
  the hood, this R package provides users with a convenient way of parsing and converting
  a desired YouTube caption into a handy 'tibble' data_frame object. Furthermore,
  users can easily save a desired YouTube caption data as a tidy Excel file without
  advanced programming background knowledge.
