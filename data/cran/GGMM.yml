title: Mixture Gaussian Graphical Models
maintainer: Bochao Jia
description: The Gaussian graphical model is a widely used tool for learning gene
  regulatory networks with high-dimensional gene expression data. For many real problems,
  the data are heterogeneous, which may contain some subgroups or come from different
  resources. This package provide a Gaussian Graphical Mixture Model (GGMM) for the
  heterogeneous data. You can refer to Jia, B. and Liang, F. (2018) at <arXiv:1805.02547>
  for detail.
