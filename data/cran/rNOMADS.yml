  An R Interface to the NOAA Operational Model Archive and
  Distribution System
maintainer: Daniel C. Bowman
description: An interface to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
  Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS, see <http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/>
  for more information) that allows R users to quickly and efficiently download global
  and regional weather model data for processing.  rNOMADS currently supports a variety
  of models ranging from global weather data to an altitude of over 40 km, to high
  resolution regional weather models, to wave and sea ice models. It can also retrieve
  archived NOMADS models.  rNOMADS can retrieve binary data in grib format as well
  as import ascii data directly into R by interfacing with the GrADS-DODS system.
