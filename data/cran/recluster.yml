title: Ordination Methods for the Analysis of Beta-Diversity Indices
maintainer: Leonardo Dapporto
description: Beta-diversity indices provide dissimilarity matrices with particular
  distribution of data requiring specific treatment. For example the high frequency
  of ties and zero values in turnover indices produces hierarchical cluster dendrograms
  whose topology and bootstrap supports are affected by the order of rows in the original
  matrix. Moreover, biogeographical regionalization can be facilitated by a combination
  of hierarchical clustering and multi-dimensional scaling. The recluster package
  provides robust techniques to analyze pattern of similarity in species composition.
