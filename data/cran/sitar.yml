description: |-
  Functions for fitting and plotting SITAR (Super
  Imposition by Translation And Rotation) growth curve models. SITAR is
  a shape-invariant model with a regression B-spline mean curve and
  subject-specific random effects on both the measurement and age
  scales.  The model was first described by Lindstrom (1995)
  <doi:10.1002/sim.4780141807> and developed as the SITAR method by Cole
  et al (2010) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>.
