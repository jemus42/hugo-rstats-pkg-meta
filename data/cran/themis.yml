title: Extra Recipes Steps for Dealing with Unbalanced Data
maintainer: Emil Hvitfeldt
description: |-
  A dataset with an uneven number of cases in each
  class is said to be unbalanced. Many models produce a subpar
  performance on unbalanced datasets. A dataset can be balanced by
  increasing the number of minority cases using SMOTE 2011
  <arXiv:1106.1813>, BorderlineSMOTE 2005 <doi:10.1007/11538059_91> and
  ADASYN 2008 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4633969>. Or by
  decreasing the number of majority cases using NearMiss 2003
  <https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Workshop2003/jzhang.pdf> or Tomek
