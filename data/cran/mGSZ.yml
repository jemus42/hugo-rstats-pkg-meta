  Gene set analysis based on GSZ-scoring function and asymptotic
  p-value
maintainer: Pashupati Mishra
description: Performs gene set analysis based on GSZ scoring function and asymptotic
  p-value. It is different from GSZ in that it implements asymptotic p-values instead
  of empirical p-values. Asymptotic p-values are calculated by fitting suitable distribution
  model to the null distribution. Unlike empirical p-values, resolution of asymptotic
  p-values are independent of the number of permutations and hence requires considerably
  fewer permutations. In addition, this package allows gene set analysis with seven
  other popular gene set analysis methods.
