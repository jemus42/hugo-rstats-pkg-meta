  Damped Anderson Acceleration with Epsilon Monotonicity for
  Accelerating EM-Like Monotone Algorithms
maintainer: Nicholas Henderson
description: Implements the DAAREM method for accelerating the convergence of slow,
  monotone sequences from smooth, fixed-point iterations such as the EM algorithm.
  For further details about the DAAREM method. see Henderson, N.C. and Varadhan, R.
