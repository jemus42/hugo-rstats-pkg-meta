title: Tools for Behavior Change Researchers and Professionals
maintainer: Gjalt-Jorn Peters
description: |-
  Contains specialised analyses and
  visualisation tools for behavior change science.
  These facilitate conducting determinant studies
  (for example, using confidence interval-based
  estimation of relevance, CIBER, or CIBERlite
  plots), systematically developing, reporting,
  and analysing interventions (for example, using
  acyclic behavior change diagrams), and reporting
  about intervention effectiveness (for example, using
  the Numbers Needed for Change), and computing the
  required sample size (using the Meaningful Change
  Definition). This package is especially useful for
  researchers in the field of behavior change or
  health psychology and to behavior change
  professionals such as intervention developers and
  prevention workers.
