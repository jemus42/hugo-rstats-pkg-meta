title: Functional Regression for Irregularly Timed Data
maintainer: John Dziak
description: |-
  Performs functional regression, and some related
  approaches, for intensive longitudinal data (see the book by Walls & Schafer,
  2006, Models for Intensive Longitudinal Data, Oxford) when such data is not
  necessarily observed on an equally spaced grid of times.  The
  approach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,
  Caffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their sample code, but
  with some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather
  than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and
  potentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the
  correlation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of
  time, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional
  regression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for
  the significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation
  of ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional predictor, but
  the same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous
  index, such as space along a north-south axis.  The development of this
  package was part of a research project supported by Award R03 CA171809-01
  from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50 DA010075 from the National
  Institute on Drug Abuse. The content is solely the responsibility of the
