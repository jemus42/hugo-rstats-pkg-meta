title: Simulate and Develop Streaming Processing
maintainer: Maurits Kaptein
description: 'While streaming processing provides opportunities to deal with extremely
  large and ever growing data sets in (near) real time, the development of streaming
  algorithms for complex models is often cumbersome: the software packages that facilitate
  streaming processing in production environments do not provide statisticians with
  the simulation, estimation, and plotting tools they are used to. Developers of streaming
  algorithms would thus benefit from the flexibility of [R] to create, plot and compute
  data while developing streaming algorithms. Package RStorm implements a streaming
  architecture modeled on Storm for easy development and testing of streaming algorithms
  in [R]. RStorm is not intended as a production package, but rather a development
  tool for streaming algorithms.'
