version: 0.2-2
title: Process Accelerometer Data for Physical Activity Measurement
maintainer: Leena Choi
description: |-
  It provides a function "wearingMarking" for classification of monitor
  wear and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess
  physical activity. The package also contains functions for making plot for
  accelerometer data and obtaining the summary of various information including
  daily monitor wear time and the mean monitor wear time during valid days.
  The revised package version 0.2-1 improved the functions in the previous version
  regarding speed and robustness. In addition, several functions were added:
  "markDelivery" can classify days for ActiGraph delivery by mail;
  "markPAI" can categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined
  cut-points of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph AGD files
  with "readActigraph" and "queryActigraph" functions. The package also better supports
  time zones and daylight saving.
