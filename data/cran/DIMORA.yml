description: 'The implemented methods are: Bass Standard model, Bass Generalized model
  (with rectangular shock, exponential shock, mixed shock and armonic shock. You can
  choose to add from 1 to 3 shocks), Guseo-Guidolin model and Variable Potential Market
  model. The Bass model consists of a simple differential equation that describes
  the process of how new products get adopted in a population, the Generalized Bass
  model is a generalization of the Bass model in which there is a "carrier" function
  x(t) that allows to change the speed of time sliding. In some real processes the
  reachable potential of the resource available in a temporal instant may appear to
  be not constant over time, because of this we use Variable Potential Market model,
  in which the Guseo-Guidolin has a particular specification for the market function.'
