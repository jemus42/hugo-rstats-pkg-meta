  Methods for Handling and Analyzing Time Series of Satellite
  Images

description: |-
  Provides functions and methods for: splitting large raster objects
  into smaller chunks, transferring images from a binary format into raster
  layers, transferring raster layers into an 'RData' file, calculating the
  maximum gap (amount of consecutive missing values) of a numeric vector,
  and fitting harmonic regression to periodic time series. The methods
  implemented for harmonic regression are based on G. Roerink, M. Menenti
  and W. Verhoef (2000) <doi:10.1080/014311600209814>.
