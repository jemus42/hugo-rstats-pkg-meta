title: Quantifying Habitat-Induced Acoustic Signal Degradation
maintainer: Marcelo Araya-Salas
description: Intended to facilitate acoustic analysis of (animal) sound transmission
  experiments, which typically aim to quantify changes in signal structure when transmitted
  in a given habitat by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing
  distances. The package offers a workflow with functions to prepare the data set
  for analysis as well as to calculate and visualize several degradation metrics,
  including blur ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, excess attenuation and envelope correlation
  among others (Dabelsteen et al 1993 <doi:10.1121/1.406682>).
