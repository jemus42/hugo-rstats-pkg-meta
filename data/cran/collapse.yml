title: Advanced and Fast Data Transformation
maintainer: Sebastian Krantz
description: |-
  A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation in R that is
  extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious to code with and programmer
  friendly. It is well integrated with 'dplyr', 'plm' and 'data.table'.
  --- Key Features: ---
  (1) Advanced data programming: A full set of fast statistical functions
  supporting grouped and weighted computations on vectors, matrices and
  data frames. Fast (ordered) and programmable grouping, factor
  generation, manipulation of data frames and data object conversions.
  (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function,
  weighted, parallelized and fully customized data aggregation.
  (3) Advanced transformations: Fast (grouped, weighted) replacing and
  sweeping out of statistics, scaling / standardizing, centering (i.e.
  between and within transformations), higher-dimensional centering
  (i.e. multiple fixed effects transformations), linear
  prediction and partialling-out.
  (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and
  (lagged / leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) differences and growth
  rates on (unordered) time-series and panel data. Multivariate auto,
  partial and cross-correlation functions for panel data.
  Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
  (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search / identification, extraction /
  subsetting, data-apply, and generalized row-binding / unlisting in 2D.
  (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed)
  summary statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.
