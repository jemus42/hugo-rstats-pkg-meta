title: Data Cloning and MCMC Tools for Maximum Likelihood Methods
maintainer: Peter Solymos
description: |-
  Low level functions for implementing
  maximum likelihood estimating procedures for
  complex models using data cloning and Bayesian
  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
  as described in Solymos 2010 (R Journal 2(2):29--37).
  Sequential and parallel MCMC support
  for 'JAGS', 'WinBUGS', 'OpenBUGS', and 'Stan'.
