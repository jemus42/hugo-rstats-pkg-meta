  Bootstrap Stacking of Random Forest Models for Heterogeneous
  Data
maintainer: Kevin Matlock
description: Generates and predicts a set of linearly stacked Random Forest models
  using bootstrap sampling. Individual datasets may be heterogeneous (not all samples
  have full sets of features). Contains support for parallelization but the user should
  register their cores before running. This is an extension of the method found in
  Matlock (2018) <doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2060-2>.
