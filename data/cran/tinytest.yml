version: 1.2.1
title: Lightweight and Feature Complete Unit Testing Framework
maintainer: Mark van der Loo
description: |-
  Provides a lightweight (zero-dependency) and easy to use
  unit testing framework. Main features: install tests with
  the package. Test results are treated as data that can be stored and
  manipulated. Test files are R scripts interspersed with test commands, that
  can be programmed over. Fully automated build-install-test sequence for
  packages. Skip tests when not run locally (e.g. on CRAN). Flexible and
  configurable output printing. Compare computed output with output stored
  with the package. Run tests in parallel. Extensible by other packages.
  Report side effects.
