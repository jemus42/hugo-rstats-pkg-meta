title: Estimates Output
maintainer: Felix Kaminsky
description: This package is intended to speedup the process of<U+000a>creating model-comparing
  tables common in Macroeconomics. The<U+000a>function collection stores the estimates
  of several models and<U+000a>formats it to a table of the form estimate starred
  and std.err.<U+000a>below. The default output is LaTeX but output to CSV for later<U+000a>editing
  in a spreadsheet tool is possible as well. It works for<U+000a>linear models (lm)
  and panel models from the "plm"-package<U+000a>(plm). Two further implemented functions
  "descsto" and<U+000a>"desctab" enable you to export descriptive statistics of<U+000a>data-frames
  and single variables to LaTeX and CSV.
