title: Terrestrial Point Cloud Processing of Forest Data
maintainer: Tiago de Conto
description: Algorithms for tree detection, noise removal, stem modelling, 3D visualization
  and manipulation of terrestrial 'LiDAR' (but not only) point clouds, currently focusing
  on high performance applications for forest inventory - being fully compatible with
  the 'LAS' infrastructure provided by 'lidR'. For in depth descriptions of the stem
  classification and segmentation algorithms check out Conto et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.compag.2017.10.019>.
