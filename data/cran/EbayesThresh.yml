title: Empirical Bayes Thresholding and Related Methods
maintainer: Peter Carbonetto
description: |-
  Empirical Bayes thresholding using the methods developed
  by I. M. Johnstone and B. W. Silverman. The basic problem is to
  estimate a mean vector given a vector of observations of the mean
  vector plus white noise, taking advantage of possible sparsity in
  the mean vector. Within a Bayesian formulation, the elements of
  the mean vector are modelled as having, independently, a
  distribution that is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero
  and a suitable heavy-tailed distribution. The mixing parameter can
  be estimated by a marginal maximum likelihood approach. This leads
  to an adaptive thresholding approach on the original data.
  Extensions of the basic method, in particular to wavelet
  thresholding, are also implemented within the package.
