title: Short Tandem Repeats Analysis of Hotspot Zones
maintainer: Philipp Hermann
description: Searches for short tandem repeats (STR) in a specified region of any
  genome. This analysis can be expanded such that several regions (chromosomes) are
  studied. These STRs can be grouped into hotspot as well as flanking regions of user
  specified width. Hotspots are defined by the double strand break maps from Pratto
  et al. (2014) <doi:10.1126/science.1256442>. Moreover, the user can also search
  for a specified motif in a DNAStringSet-object, or a fasta-file, or a specified
  region of any genome. For an application of STR detections please see Heissl et
  al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/431841>.
