title: Relational Operators for Intervals
maintainer: Peter Solymos
description: |-
  Evaluating if values
  of vectors are within different open/closed intervals
  (`x %[]% c(a, b)`), or if two closed
  intervals overlap (`c(a1, b1) %[]o[]% c(a2, b2)`).
  Operators for negation and directional relations also implemented.
