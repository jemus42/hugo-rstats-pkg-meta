title: Hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA Models
maintainer: Chen Dong
description: 'It covers several Bayesian Analysis of Variance (BANOVA) models used
  in analysis of experimental designs in which both within- and between- subjects
  factors are manipulated. They can be applied to data that are common in the behavioral
  and social sciences. The package includes: Hierarchical Bayes ANOVA models with
  normal response, t response, Binomial (Bernoulli) response, Poisson response, ordered
  multinomial response and multinomial response variables. All models accommodate
  unobserved heterogeneity by including a normal distribution of the parameters across
  individuals. Outputs of the package include tables of sums of squares, effect sizes
  and p-values, and tables of predictions, which are easily interpretable for behavioral
  and social researchers. The floodlight analysis and mediation analysis based on
  these models are also provided. BANOVA uses ''Stan'' and ''JAGS'' as the computational
  platform.'
