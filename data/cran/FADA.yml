  Variable Selection for Supervised Classification in High
  Dimension
maintainer: David Causeur
description: |-
  The functions provided in the FADA (Factor Adjusted Discriminant Analysis) package aim at performing supervised classification of high-dimensional and correlated profiles. The procedure combines a decorrelation step based on a
  factor modeling of the dependence among covariates and a classification method. The available methods are Lasso regularized logistic model
  (see Friedman et al. (2010)), sparse linear discriminant analysis (see
  Clemmensen et al. (2011)), shrinkage linear and diagonal discriminant
  analysis (see M. Ahdesmaki et al. (2010)). More methods of classification can be used on the decorrelated data provided by the package FADA.
