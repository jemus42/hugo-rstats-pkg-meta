  Visualisation of Sequential Probability Distributions Using Fan
  Charts
maintainer: Guy J. Abel
description: |-
  Visualise sequential distributions using a range of plotting
  styles. Sequential distribution data can be input as either simulations or
  values corresponding to percentiles over time. Plots are added to
  existing graphic devices using the fan function. Users can choose from four
  different styles, including fan chart type plots, where a set of coloured
  polygon, with shadings corresponding to the percentile values are layered
  to represent different uncertainty levels. Full details in R Journal article; Abel (2015) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2015-002>.
