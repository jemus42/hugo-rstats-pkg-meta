title: Testing the additional predictive value of high-dimensional data
maintainer: Anne-Laure Boulesteix
description: |-
  'globalboosttest' implements a permutation-based testing
  procedure to globally test the (additional) predictive value of
  a large set of predictors given that a small set of predictors
  is already available. Currently, 'globalboosttest' supports
  binary outcomes (via logistic regression) and survival outcomes
  (via Cox regression). It is based on boosting regression as
  implemented in the package 'mboost'.
