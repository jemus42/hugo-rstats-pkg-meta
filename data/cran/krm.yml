title: Kernel Based Regression Models
maintainer: Youyi Fong
description: Implements several methods for testing the variance component parameter
  in regression models that contain kernel-based random effects, including a maximum
  of adjusted scores test. Several kernels are supported, including a profile hidden
  Markov model mutual information kernel for protein sequence. This package is described
  in Fong et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxu056>.
