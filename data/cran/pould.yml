title: Phased or Unphased Linkage Disequilibrium
maintainer: Steven Mack
description: Computes the D', Wn, and conditional asymmetric linkage disequilibrium
  (ALD) measures for pairs of genetic loci. Performs these linkage disequilibrium
  (LD) calculations on phased genotype data recorded using Genotype List (GL) String
  or columnar formats. Alternatively, generates expectation-maximization (EM) estimated
  haplotypes from phased data, or performs LD calculations on EM estimated haplotypes.
  Performs sign tests comparing LD values for phased and unphased datasets, and generates
  heat-maps for each LD measure. Described by Osoegawa et al. (2019a) <doi:10.1016/j.humimm.2019.01.010>,
  and Osoegawa et. al. (2019b) <doi:10.1016/j.humimm.2019.05.018>.
