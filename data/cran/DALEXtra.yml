title: Extension for 'DALEX' Package
maintainer: Szymon Maksymiuk
description: |-
  Provides wrapper of various machine learning models.
  In applied machine learning, there
  is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance
  between interpretability and accuracy.
  However, in field of the interpretable machine learning,
  there are more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models,
  that are implemented in 'R'.
  'DALEXtra' creates 'DALEX' Biecek (2018) <arXiv:1806.08915> explainer for many type of models
  including those created using 'python' 'scikit-learn' and 'keras' libraries, 'java' 'h2o' library and
  'mljar' API. Important part of the package is Champion-Challenger analysis and innovative approach
  to model performance across subsets of test data presented in Funnel Plot.
  Third branch of 'DALEXtra' package is aspect importance analysis
  that provides instance-level explanations for the groups of explanatory variables.
