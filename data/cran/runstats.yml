title: Fast Computation of Running Statistics for Time Series
maintainer: Marta Karas
description: |-
  Provides methods for fast computation of running sample
  statistics for time series. These include: (1) mean, (2)
  standard deviation, and (3) variance over a fixed-length window
  of time-series, (4) correlation, (5) covariance, and (6)
  Euclidean distance (L2 norm) between short-time pattern and
  time-series. Implemented methods utilize Convolution Theorem to
  compute convolutions via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
