title: Encoding of Nucleotide Sequences into Numeric Feature Vectors
maintainer: Prabina Kumar Meher
description: We describe fifteen different splice site sequence encoding schemes that
  have been used in earlier studies for mapping of splice site sequences into numeric
  feature vectors. These encoding schemes will also be helpful for transforming other
  nucleotide sequences into numeric forms, provided they are of equal length. These
  encoding schemes will help the computational biologist working in the field of classification
  (binary or multiclass) or prediction involving nucleic acid sequences of equal length.
