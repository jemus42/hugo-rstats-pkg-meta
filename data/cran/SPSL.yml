title: Site Percolation on Square Lattices (SPSL)
maintainer: Pavel V. Moskalev
description: |-
  Provides basic functionality for labeling
  iso- & anisotropic percolation clusters on 2D & 3D square lattices
  with various lattice sizes, occupation probabilities, von Neumann &
  Moore (1,d)-neighborhoods, and random variables weighting
  the percolation lattice sites.
