title: Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series
maintainer: Martin Becker
description: |-
  Three generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has
  already an implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented: first,
  'MSCMT' allows for using multiple outcome variables, second, time series
  can be supplied as economic predictors, and third, a well-defined
  cross-validation approach can be used.
  Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable as possible
  (including edge cases) without losing computational efficiency.
  A detailed description of the main algorithms is given in
  Becker and Klößner (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2017.08.002>.
