title: Fisher-Wright Population Simulation
maintainer: Mikkel Meyer Andersen
description: Simulates a population under the Fisher-Wright model (fixed or stochastic
  population size) with a one-step neutral mutation process (stepwise mutation model,
  logistic mutation model and exponential mutation model supported). The stochastic
  population sizes are random Poisson distributed and different kinds of population
  growth are supported. For the stepwise mutation model, it is possible to specify
  locus and direction specific mutation rate (in terms of upwards and downwards mutation
  rate). Intermediate generations can be saved in order to study e.g. drift.
