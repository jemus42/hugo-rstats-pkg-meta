  Estimation of the Relative Importance of Factors Affecting
  Species Distribution Based on Stability Concept
maintainer: Cástor Guisande González
description: From output files obtained from the software 'ModestR', the relative
  contribution of factors to explain species distribution is depicted using several
  plots. A global geographic raster file for each environmental variable may be also
  obtained with the mean relative contribution, considering all species present in
  each raster cell, of the factor to explain species distribution. Finally, for each
  variable it is also possible to compare the frequencies of any variable obtained
  in the cells where the species is present with the frequencies of the same variable
  in the cells of the extent.
