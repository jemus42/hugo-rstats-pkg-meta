  Damage functions from FEMA's HAZUS software for use in modeling
  financial losses from natural disasters
maintainer: Gopi Goteti
description: |-
  Damage Functions (DFs), also known as
  Vulnerability Functions, associate the physical damage
  to a building or a structure (and also its contents and
  inventory) from natural disasters to financial damage.
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in USA
  developed several thousand DFs and these serve as a
  benchmark in natural catastrophe modeling, both in
  academia and industry. However, these DFs and their
  documentation are buried within the HAZUS software are
  not easily accessible for analysis and visualization.
  This package provides more than 1300 raw DFs used by FEMA's
  HAZUS software and also functionality to extract and
  visualize DFs specific to the flood hazard. The vignette
  included with this package demonstrates its use.
