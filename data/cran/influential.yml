title: Identification of the Most Influential Nodes
maintainer: Adrian Salavaty
description: |-
  Contains functions for reconstruction of networks from
  adjacency matrices and data frames, analysis of the topology of the network
  and calculation of centrality measures, and identification of the most
  influential nodes. Also, some functions have been provided for the assessment
  of dependence and correlation of two network centrality measures as well as
  the conditional probability of deviation from their corresponding means in opposite direction.
