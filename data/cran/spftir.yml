title: Pre-Processing and Analysis of Mid-Infrared Spectral Region
maintainer: Claudio Pozo Valenzuela
description: Functions to manipulate, pre-process and analyze spectra in the mid-infrared
  region. The pre-processing of the mid-infrared spectra is a transcendental step
  in the spectral analysis. Preprocessing of the spectra includes smoothing, offset,
  baseline correction, and normalization,  is performed before the analysis of the
  spectra and is essential to obtain conclusive results in subsequent quantitative
  or qualitative analysis. This package was supported by FONDECYT 3150630, and CIPA
  Conicyt-Regional R08C1002 is gratefully acknowledged.
