title: FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) Utilities
maintainer: Andrew Harris
description: |-
  Utilities to read and write files in the FITS (Flexible
  Image Transport System) format, a standard format in astronomy (see
  e.g. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS> for more information).
  Present low-level routines allow: reading, parsing, and modifying
  FITS headers; reading FITS images (multi-dimensional arrays);
  reading FITS binary and ASCII tables; and writing FITS images
  (multi-dimensional arrays).  Higher-level functions allow: reading
  files composed of one or more headers and a single (perhaps
  multidimensional) image or single table; reading tables into
  data frames; generating vectors for image array axes; scaling and
  writing images as 16-bit integers.  Known incompletenesses are
  reading random group extensions, as well as
  bit, complex, and array descriptor data types in binary tables.
