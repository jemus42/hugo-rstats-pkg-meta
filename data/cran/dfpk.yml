  Bayesian Dose-Finding Designs using Pharmacokinetics (PK) for
  Phase I Clinical Trials
maintainer: Artemis Toumazi
description: Statistical methods involving PK measures are provided, in the dose allocation
  process during a Phase I clinical trials. These methods, proposed by Ursino et al,
  (2017) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201600084>, enter pharmacokinetics (PK) in the dose finding
  designs in different ways, including covariates models, dependent variable or hierarchical
  models. This package provides functions to generate data from several scenarios
  and functions to run simulations which their objective is to determine the maximum
  tolerated dose (MTD).
