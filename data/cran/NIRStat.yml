  Novel Statistical Methods for Studying Near-Infrared
  Spectroscopy (NIRS) Time Series Data
maintainer: Yikai Wang
description: 'Provides transfusion-related differential tests on Near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) time series with detection limit, which contains two testing statistics:
  Mean Area Under the Curve (MAUC) and slope statistic. This package applied a penalized
  spline method within an imputation setting. Testing is conducted by a nested permutation
  approach within imputation. Refer to Guo et al (2018) <arXiv:1801.08153> for further
  details.'
