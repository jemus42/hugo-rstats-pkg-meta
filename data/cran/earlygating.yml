title: Properties of Bayesian Early Gating Designs
maintainer: Elias Laurin Meyer
description: |-
  Computes the most important properties of four 'Bayesian' early gating
  designs (two single arm and two randomized controlled designs), such
  as minimum required number of successes in the experimental group to
  make a GO decision, operating characteristics and average operating
  characteristics with respect to the sample size.
  These might aid in deciding what design to use for the early phase trial.
