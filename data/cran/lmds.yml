title: Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling
maintainer: Robrecht Cannoodt
description: |2-

  A fast dimensionality reduction method scaleable to large numbers of samples.
  Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) is an extension of classical Torgerson MDS,
  but rather than calculating a complete distance matrix between all pairs of samples,
  only the distances between a set of landmarks and the samples are calculated.
