  Generalized Linear Mixed Model Analysis via Expectation
  Propagation
maintainer: Matt P. Wand
description: Approximate frequentist inference for generalized linear mixed model
  analysis with expectation propagation used to circumvent the need for multivariate
  integration. In this version, the random effects can be any reasonable dimension.
  However, only probit mixed models with one level of nesting are supported. The methodology
  is described in Hall, Johnstone, Ormerod, Wand and Yu (2018) <arXiv:1805.08423v1>.
