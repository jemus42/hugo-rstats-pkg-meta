title: Genetic Algorithm for Curve Fitting
maintainer: Telford Tendys
description: |-
  A group of sample points are evaluated against a
  user-defined expression, the sample points are lists of
  parameters with values that may be substituted into that
  expression. The genetic algorithm attempts to make the result
  of the expression as low as possible (usually this would be the
  sum of residuals squared).
