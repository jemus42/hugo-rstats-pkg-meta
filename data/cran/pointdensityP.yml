title: Point Density for Geospatial Data
maintainer: Paul Evangelista
description: |-
  The function pointdensity returns a density count and the temporal average for
  every point in the original list. The dataframe returned includes four
  columns: lat, lon, count, and date_avg. The "lat" column is the original
  latitude data; the "lon" column is the original longitude data; the "count"
  is the density count of the number of points within a radius of
  radius*grid_size (the neighborhood); and the date_avg column includes the
  average date of each point in the neighborhood.
