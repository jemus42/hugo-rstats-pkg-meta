title: Functions to Explore L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)
maintainer: Bryan Hanson
description: |-
  L-systems or Lindenmayer systems are parallel rewriting systems which can
  be used to simulate biological forms and certain kinds of fractals.
  Briefly, in an L-system a series of symbols in a string are replaced
  iteratively according to rules to give a more complex string. Eventually,
  the symbols are translated into turtle graphics for plotting. Wikipedia has
  a very good introduction: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system This package
  provides basic functions for exploring L-systems.
