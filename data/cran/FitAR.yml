title: Subset AR Model Fitting
maintainer: A.I. McLeod
description: Comprehensive model building function for identification,<U+000a>estimation
  and diagnostic checking for AR and subset AR models.<U+000a>Two types of subset
  AR models are supported.  One family of<U+000a>subset AR models, denoted by ARp,
  is formed by taking subet of<U+000a>the original AR coefficients and in the other,
  denoted by ARz,<U+000a>subsets of the partial autocorrelations are used. The main<U+000a>advantage
  of the ARz model is its applicability to very large<U+000a>order models.
