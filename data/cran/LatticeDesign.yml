maintainer: Xu He
description: |-
  Lattice-based space-filling designs with fill or separation distance properties, including interleaved lattice-based maximin distance designs proposed in Xu He (2018) <arXiv:1807.02289v1>,
  (sliced) rotated sphere packing designs proposed in Xu He (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1222289>
  and Xu He (2018) <doi:10.1080/00401706.2018.1458655>, and densest packing-based maximum projections designs proposed in Xu He (2018) <arXiv:1709.02062v2>.
