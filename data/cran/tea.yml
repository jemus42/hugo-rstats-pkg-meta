title: Threshold Estimation Approaches
maintainer: Johannes Ossberger
description: Different approaches for selecting the threshold in generalized Pareto
  distributions. Most of them are based on minimizing the AMSE-criterion or at least
  by reducing the bias of the assumed GPD-model. Others are heuristically motivated
  by searching for stable sample paths, i.e. a nearly constant region of the tail
  index estimator with respect to k, which is the number of data in the tail. The
  third class is motivated by graphical inspection. In addition, a sequential testing
  procedure for GPD-GoF-tests is also implemented here.
