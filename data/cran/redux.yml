version: 1.1.0
title: R Bindings to 'hiredis'
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  A 'hiredis' wrapper that includes support for
  transactions, pipelining, blocking subscription, serialisation of
  all keys and values, 'Redis' error handling with R errors.
  Includes an automatically generated 'R6' interface to the full
  'hiredis' 'API'.  Generated functions are faithful to the
  'hiredis' documentation while attempting to match R's argument
  semantics.  Serialisation must be explicitly done by the user, but
  both binary and text-mode serialisation is supported.
