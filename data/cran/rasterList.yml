title: A Raster Where Cells are Generic Objects
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  A S4 class has been created such that complex operations can be
  executed on each cells of a raster map. The raster of objects contains the
  traditional raster map with the addition of a list of generic objects: one
  object for each raster cells. It allows to write few lines of R code for complex
  map algebra. Two environmental applications about frequency analysis of raster
  map of precipitation and creation of a raster map of soil water retention curves
  have been presented.
