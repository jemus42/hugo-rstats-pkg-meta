title: Simulates LOX Drop Testing
maintainer: Chad Ross
description: |-
  Generates simulated data representing the LOX drop testing
  process (also known as impact testing). A simulated process allows for
  accelerated study of test behavior. Functions are provided to simulate
  trials, test series, and groups of test series. Functions for creating plots
  specific to this process are also included. Test attributes and criteria can
  be set arbitrarily. This work is not endorsed by or affiliated with NASA.

  of Materials to Mechanical Impact in Ambient Liquid Oxygen and Pressurized
  Liquid and Gaseous Oxygen Environments" <doi:10.1520/G0086-17>.
