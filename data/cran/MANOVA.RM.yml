  Resampling-Based Analysis of Multivariate Data and Repeated
  Measures Designs
maintainer: Sarah Friedrich
description: |-
  Implemented are various tests for semi-parametric repeated measures
  and general MANOVA designs that do neither assume multivariate normality nor
  covariance homogeneity, i.e., the procedures are applicable for a wide range
  of general multivariate factorial designs. In addition to asymptotic inference
  methods, novel bootstrap and permutation approaches are implemented as well. These provide more
  accurate results in case of small to moderate sample sizes. Furthermore, post-hoc
  comparisons are provided for the multivariate analyses.
