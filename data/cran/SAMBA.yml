  Selection and Misclassification Bias Adjustment for Logistic
  Regression Models

  Health research using data from electronic health records (EHR) has gained
  popularity, but misclassification of EHR-derived disease status and lack of
  representativeness of the study sample can result in substantial bias in
  effect estimates and can impact power and type I error for association
  tests. Here, the assumed target of inference is the relationship between
  binary disease status and predictors modeled using a logistic regression
  model. 'SAMBA' implements several methods for obtaining bias-corrected
  point estimates along with valid standard errors as proposed in Beesley and
  Mukherjee (2020) <doi:10.1101/2019.12.26.19015859>, currently under review.
