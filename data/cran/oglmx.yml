title: Estimation of Ordered Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Nathan Carroll
description: Ordered models such as ordered probit and ordered logit presume that
  the error variance is constant across observations. In the case that this assumption
  does not hold estimates of marginal effects are typically biased (Weiss (1997)).
  This package allows for generalization of ordered probit and ordered logit models
  by allowing the user to specify a model for the variance. Furthermore, the package
  includes functions to calculate the marginal effects. Wrapper functions to estimate
  the standard limited dependent variable models are also included.
