description: |-
  MultiSV is an R package for identification of structural
  variations in multiple populations based on whole genome resequencing. It
  fits linear mixed model and identifies structural variations in multiple
  populations using whole genome sequencing data. It could also be
  manipulated to use on RNA-seq data for differential gene expression
  (implementation in future releases). Main steps for analysis include
  generating read depth in bins using ComputeBinCounts. conversion of bins to
  MultiSV format using Bin2MultiSV. Finally, identification of structural
  variations using CallMultiSV.
