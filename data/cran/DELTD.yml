title: Kernel Density Estimation using Lifetime Distributions
maintainer: Javaria Ahmad Khan
description: |-
  A collection of asymmetrical kernels belong to lifetime distributions for kernel density estimation is presented.
  Mean Squared Errors (MSE) are calculated for estimated curves. For this purpose, R functions allow the distribution to be Gamma, Exponential or Weibull.
  For details see Chen (2000), Jin and Kawczak (2003) and Salha et al. (2014) <doi:10.12988/pms.2014.4616>.
