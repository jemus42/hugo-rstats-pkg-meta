maintainer: Chiu-Hsieh Hsu
description: 'Imputation for both missing covariates and censored observations (optional)
  for survival data with missing covariates by the nearest neighbor based multiple
  imputation algorithm as described in Hsu et al. (2006) <doi:10.1002/sim.2452>, and
  Hsu and Yu (2018) <doi: 10.1177/0962280218772592>. Note that the current version
