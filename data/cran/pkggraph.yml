  A Consistent and Intuitive Platform to Explore the Dependencies
  of Packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network Like
  Repositories
maintainer: KS Srikanth
description: Interactively explore various dependencies of a package(s) (on the Comprehensive
  R Archive Network Like repositories) and perform analysis using tidy philosophy.
  Most of the functions return a 'tibble' object (enhancement of 'dataframe') which
  can be used for further analysis. The package offers functions to produce 'network'
  and 'igraph' dependency graphs. The 'plot' method produces a static plot based on
  'ggnetwork' and 'plotd3' function produces an interactive D3 plot based on 'networkD3'.
