maintainer: Tim Riffe
description: A set of three two-census methods to the estimate the degree of death
  registration coverage for a population. Implemented methods include the Generalized
  Growth Balance method (GGB), the Synthetic Extinct Generation method (SEG), and
  a hybrid of the two, GGB-SEG. Each method offers automatic estimation, but users
  may also specify exact parameters or use a graphical interface to guess parameters
  in the traditional way if desired.
