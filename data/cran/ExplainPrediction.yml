  Explanation of Predictions for Classification and Regression
  Models
maintainer: Marko Robnik-Sikonja
description: |-
  Generates explanations for classification and regression models and visualizes them.
  Explanations are generated for individual predictions as well as for models as a whole. Two explanation methods
  are included, EXPLAIN and IME. The EXPLAIN method is fast but might miss explanations expressed redundantly
  in the model. The IME method is slower as it samples from all feature subsets.
  For the EXPLAIN method see Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko (2008) <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2007.190734>,
  and the IME method is described in Strumbelj and Kononenko (2010, JMLR, vol. 11:1-18).
  All models in package 'CORElearn' are natively supported, for other prediction models a wrapper function is provided
  and illustrated for models from packages 'randomForest', 'nnet', and 'e1071'.
