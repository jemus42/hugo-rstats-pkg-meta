title: Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony' Models
maintainer: Antonio Prestes Garcia
description: |-
  The EvoPER, Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for Individual-based Models is an extensible
  package providing optimization driven parameter estimation methods using metaheuristics  and
  evolutionary computation techniques (Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization
  for continuous domains, Tabu Search, Evolutionary Strategies, ...)  which could be more efficient and require,
  in some cases, fewer model evaluations than alternatives relying on experimental design.  Currently there
  are built in support for models developed with 'Repast Simphony'  Agent-Based framework (<https://repast.github.io/>)
  and with NetLogo (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>) which are the most used frameworks for Agent-based modeling.
