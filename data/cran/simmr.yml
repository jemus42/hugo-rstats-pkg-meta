title: A Stable Isotope Mixing Model
maintainer: Andrew Parnell
description: Fits Stable Isotope Mixing Models (SIMMs) and is meant as a longer term
  replacement to the previous widely-used package SIAR. SIMMs are used to infer dietary
  proportions of organisms consuming various food sources from observations on the
  stable isotope values taken from the organisms' tissue samples. However SIMMs can
  also be used in other scenarios, such as in sediment mixing or the composition of
  fatty acids. The main functions are simmr_load and simmr_mcmc. The two vignettes
  contain a quick start and a full listing of all the features. The methods used are
  detailed in the papers Parnell et al 2010 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009672>, and
  Parnell et al 2013 <doi:10.1002/env.2221>.
