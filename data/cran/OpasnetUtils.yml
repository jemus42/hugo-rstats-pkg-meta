description: |-
  Contains tools for open assessment and modelling in Opasnet,
  a wiki-based web site and workspace for societal decision making
  (see <http://en.opasnet.org/w/Main_Page> for more information).
  The core principle of the workspace is maximal openness and modularity.
  Variables are defined on public wiki pages using wiki inputs/tables,
  databases and R code. This package provides the functionality to download and use these
  variables. It also contains health impact assessment tools such as
  spatial methods for exposure modelling.
