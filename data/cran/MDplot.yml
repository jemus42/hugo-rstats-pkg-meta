version: 1.0.1
title: Visualising Molecular Dynamics Analyses
maintainer: Christian Margreitter
description: |-
  Provides automatization for plot generation succeeding common molecular dynamics analyses.
  This includes straightforward plots, such as RMSD (Root-Mean-Square-Deviation) and
  RMSF (Root-Mean-Square-Fluctuation) but also more sophisticated ones such as
  dihedral angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and
  DSSP (Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis. Currently able to load
  GROMOS, GROMACS and AMBER formats, respectively.
