title: Programmatic Conversion of PDF Tables
maintainer: Eric Persson
description: |-
  Allows the user to convert PDF tables to formats more amenable to
  analysis ('.csv', '.xml', or '.xlsx') by wrapping the PDFTables API.
  In order to use the package, the user needs to sign up for an API account
  on the PDFTables website (<https://pdftables.com/pdf-to-excel-api>).
  The package works by taking a PDF file as input, uploading it to PDFTables,
  and returning a file with the extracted data.
