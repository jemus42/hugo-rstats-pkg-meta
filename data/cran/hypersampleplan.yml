  Attribute Sampling Plan with Exact Hypergeometric Probabilities
  using Chebyshev Polynomials
maintainer: XU Hang
description: |-
  Implements an algorithm for efficient and exact calculation of hypergeometric
  and binomial probabilities using Chebyshev polynomials, while other algorithm use an
  approximation when N is large. A useful applications is also considered in this package
  for the construction of attribute sampling plans which is an important field of statistical
  quality control. The quantile, and the confidence limit for the attribute sampling plan are
  also implemented in this package. The hypergeometric distribution can be represented in
  terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This representation is particularly useful in the calculation
  of exact values of hypergeometric variables.
