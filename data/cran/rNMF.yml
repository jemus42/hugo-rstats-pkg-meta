title: Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
maintainer: Yifan Ethan Xu
description: An implementation of robust nonnegative matrix factorization (rNMF).
  The rNMF algorithm decomposes a nonnegative high dimension data matrix into the
  product of two low rank nonnegative matrices, while detecting and trimming outliers.
  The main function is rnmf(). The package also includes a visualization tool, see(),
  that arranges and prints vectorized images.
