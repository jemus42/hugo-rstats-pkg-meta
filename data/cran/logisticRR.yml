title: Adjusted Relative Risk from Logistic Regression
maintainer: Youjin Lee
description: Adjusted odds ratio conditional on potential confounders can be directly
  obtained from logistic regression. However, those adjusted odds ratios have been
  widely incorrectly interpreted as a relative risk. As relative risk is often of
  interest in public health, we provide a simple code to return adjusted relative
  risks from logistic regression model under potential confounders.
