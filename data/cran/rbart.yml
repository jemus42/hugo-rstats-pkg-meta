title: Bayesian Trees for Conditional Mean and Variance
maintainer: Robert McCulloch
description: |2-

  A model of the form Y = f(x) + s(x) Z is fit where functions f and s are modeled with ensembles of trees and Z is standard normal.
  This model is developed in the paper 'Heteroscedastic BART Via Multiplicative Regression Trees'
  (Pratola, Chipman, George, and McCulloch, 2019, <arXiv:1709.07542v2>).
  BART refers to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. See the R-package 'BART'.
  The predictor vector x may be high dimensional.
  A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm provides Bayesian posterior uncertainty for both f and s.
  The MCMC uses the recent innovations in
  Efficient Metropolis--Hastings proposal mechanisms for Bayesian regression tree models
  (Pratola, 2015, Bayesian Analysis, <doi:10.1214/16-BA999>).
