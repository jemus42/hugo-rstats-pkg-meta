title: Numerical Estimation of Sparse Hessians
maintainer: Michael Braun
description: |-
  Estimates Hessian of a scalar-valued function, and returns it
  in a sparse Matrix format. The sparsity pattern must be known in advance. The
  algorithm is especially efficient for hierarchical models with a large number of
  heterogeneous units.  See Braun, M. (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v082.i10>.
