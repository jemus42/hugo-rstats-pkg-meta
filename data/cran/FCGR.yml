title: Fatigue Crack Growth in Reliability
maintainer: Antonio Meneses
description: |-
  Fatigue Crack Growth in Reliability estimates the distribution
  of material lifetime due to mechanical fatigue efforts. The FCGR
  package provides simultaneous crack growth curves fitting to
  different specimens in materials under mechanical stress efforts.
  Linear mixed-effects models (LME) with smoothing B-Splines
  and the linearized Paris-Erdogan law are applied. Once defined
  the fail for a determined crack length, the distribution function
  of failure times to fatigue is obtained. The density function is
  estimated by applying nonparametric binned kernel density estimate
  (bkde) and the kernel estimator of the distribution function (kde).
  The results of Pinheiro and Bates method based on nonlinear
  mixed-effects regression (nlme) can be also retrieved. The package
  contains the crack.growth, PLOT.cg, IB.F, and Alea.A (database) functions.
