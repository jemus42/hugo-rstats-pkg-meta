title: Tools for network tomography
maintainer: Alexander W Blocker
description: networkTomography implements the methods developed and evaluated in<U+000a>Blocker
  and Airoldi (2011) and Airoldi and Blocker (2012). These include the<U+000a>authors'
  own dynamic multilevel model with calibration based upon a Gaussian<U+000a>state-space
  model in addition to implementations of the methods of Tebaldi &<U+000a>West (1998;
  Poisson-Gamma model with MCMC sampling), Zhang et al. (2002;<U+000a>tomogravity),
  Cao et al. (2000; Gaussian model with mean-variance relation),<U+000a>and Vardi
  (1996; method of moments). Data from the 1router network of Cao et<U+000a>al. (2000),
  the Abilene network of Fang et al. (2007), and the CMU network<U+000a>of Blocker
  and Airoldi (2011) are included for testing and reproducibility.
