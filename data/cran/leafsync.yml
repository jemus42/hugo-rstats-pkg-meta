title: Small Multiples for Leaflet Web Maps
maintainer: Tim Appelhans
description: |-
  Create small multiples of several leaflet web maps with (optional)
  synchronised panning and zooming control. When syncing is enabled all maps
  respond to mouse actions on one map. This allows side-by-side comparisons
  of different attributes of the same geometries. Syncing can be adjusted
  so that any combination of maps can be synchronised.
