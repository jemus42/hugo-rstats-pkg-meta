title: Construct Modeling Packages
maintainer: Davis Vaughan
description: |-
  Building modeling packages is hard. A large amount of effort
  generally goes into providing an implementation for a new method that is
  efficient, fast, and correct, but often less emphasis is put on the user
  interface. A good interface requires specialized knowledge about S3 methods
  and formulas, which the average package developer might not have.
  The goal of 'hardhat' is to reduce the burden around building new modeling
  packages by providing functionality for preprocessing, predicting, and
  validating input.
