maintainer: Dominik Krzeminski
description: |-
  Creating a great user interface for your Shiny apps
  can be a hassle, especially if you want to work purely in R
  and don't want to use, for instance HTML templates. This
  package adds support for a powerful UI library Semantic UI -
  <http://semantic-ui.com/>. It also supports universal UI input
  binding that works with various DOM elements.
