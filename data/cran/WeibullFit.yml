maintainer: Thiago Martins
description: 'Provides a single function to fit data of an input data frame into one
  of the selected Weibull functions (w2, w3 and it''s truncated versions), calculating
  the scale, location and shape parameters accordingly. The resulting plots and files
  are saved into the ''folder'' parameter provided by the user. References: a) John
