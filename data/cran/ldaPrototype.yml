title: Prototype of Multiple Latent Dirichlet Allocation Runs
maintainer: Jonas Rieger
description: 'Determine a Prototype from a number of runs of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  (LDA) measuring its similarities with S-CLOP: A procedure to select the LDA run
  with highest mean pairwise similarity, which is measured by S-CLOP (Similarity of
  multiple sets by Clustering with Local Pruning), to all other runs. LDA runs are
  specified by its assignments leading to estimators for distribution parameters.
  Repeated runs lead to different results, which we encounter by choosing the most
  representative LDA run as prototype.'
