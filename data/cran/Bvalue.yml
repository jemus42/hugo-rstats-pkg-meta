title: B-Value and Empirical Equivalence Bound
maintainer: Yi Zhao
description: 'Calculates B-value and empirical equivalence bound. B-value is defined
  as the maximum magnitude of a confidence interval; and the empirical equivalence
  bound is the minimum B-value at a certain level. A new two-stage procedure for hypothesis
  testing is proposed, where the first stage is conventional hypothesis testing and
  the second is an equivalence testing procedure using the introduced empirical equivalence
  bound. See Zhao et al. (2019) "B-Value and Empirical Equivalence Bound: A New Procedure
  of Hypothesis Testing" <arXiv:1912.13084> for details.'
