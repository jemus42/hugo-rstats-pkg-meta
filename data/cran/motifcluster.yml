title: Motif-Based Spectral Clustering of Weighted Directed Networks
maintainer: William George Underwood
description: |2-

  Tools for spectral clustering of weighted directed networks using motif
  adjacency matrices. Methods perform well on large and sparse networks, and
  random sampling methods for generating weighted directed networks are also
  provided. Based on methodology detailed in Underwood, Elliott and Cucuringu
  (2020) <arXiv:2004.01293>.
