maintainer: Brendan Houng
description: |-
  An implementation of the TrueSkill algorithm (Herbrich,
  R., Minka, T. and Grapel, T) in R; a Bayesian skill rating
  system with inference by approximate message passing on a
  factor graph. Used by Xbox to rank gamers and identify
  appropriate matches.

  time permits.  Requires R version 3.0 as it is written with
  Reference Classes.  URL:
