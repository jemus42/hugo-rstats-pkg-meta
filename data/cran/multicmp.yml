  Flexible Modeling of Multivariate Count Data via the
  Multivariate Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution
maintainer: Diag Davenport
description: A toolkit containing statistical analysis models motivated by multivariate
  forms of the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution for flexible modeling
  of multivariate count data, especially in the presence of data dispersion. Currently
  the package only supports bivariate data, via the bivariate COM-Poisson distribution
  described in Sellers et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2016.04.007>. Future development
  will extend the package to higher-dimensional data.
