  Extensible Package for Principal-Component-Regression-Based
  Heterogeneous Ensemble Meta-Learning
maintainer: Alireza S. Mahani
description: Extends the base classes and methods of 'EnsembleBase' package for Principal-Components-Regression-based
  (PCR) integration of base learners. Default implementation uses cross-validation
  error to choose the optimal number of PC components for the final predictor. The
  package takes advantage of the file method provided in 'EnsembleBase' package for
  writing estimation objects to disk in order to circumvent RAM bottleneck. Special
  save and load methods are provided to allow estimation objects to be saved to permanent
  files on disk, and to be loaded again into temporary files in a later R session.
  Users and developers can extend the package by extending the generic methods and
  classes provided in 'EnsembleBase' package as well as this package.
