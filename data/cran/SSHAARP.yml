title: Searching Shared HLA Amino Acid Residue Prevalence
maintainer: Livia Tran
description: Processes amino acid alignments produced by the 'IPD-IMGT/HLA (Immuno
  Polymorphism-ImMunoGeneTics/Human Leukocyte Antigen) Database' to identify user-defined
  amino acid residue motifs shared across HLA alleles, and calculates the frequencies
  of those motifs based on HLA allele frequency data. 'SSHAARP' (Searching Shared
  HLA Amino Acid Residue Prevalence) uses 'Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)' software and
  the 'GMT' R package to generate global frequency heat maps that illustrate the distribution
  of each user-defined map around the globe. 'SSHAARP' analyzes the allele frequency
  data described by Solberg et al. (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.humimm.2008.05.001>, a global
  set of 497 population samples from 185 published datasets, representing 66,800 individuals
  total.
