description: |-
  Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations,
  integer partitions and compositions. The arrangements are in
  lexicographical order and generated iteratively in a memory efficient manner.
  It has been demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most existing
  packages of similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at
