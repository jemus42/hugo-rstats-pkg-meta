title: Some Algorithms for Mixed Models
maintainer: Deniz Akdemir
description: This program can be used to fit Gaussian linear mixed models (LMM). Univariate
  and multivariate response models, multiple variance components, as well as, certain
  correlation and covariance structures are supported. In many occasions, the user
  can pick one of the several mixed model fitting algorithms, which are explained
  further in the details section. Some algorithms are specific to certain types of
  models (univariate or multivariate, diagonal or non-diagonal residual, one or multiple
  variance components, etc,...).
