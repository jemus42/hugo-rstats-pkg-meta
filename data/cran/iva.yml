  Instrumental Variable Analysis in Case-Control Association
  Studies
maintainer: Han Zhang
description: Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a special case of instrumental
  variable analysis with genetic instruments. It is used to estimate the unconfounded
  causal effect of an exposure. This package implements estimating and testing methods
  in Zhang et al. (2019) for MR analysis in case-control studies. It (1) estimates
  the causal effect of a quantitative exposure by the quasi empirical likelihood approach;
  (2) uses Lagrange multiplier test for testing the presence of causal; (3) provides
  a test for the presence of confounder.
