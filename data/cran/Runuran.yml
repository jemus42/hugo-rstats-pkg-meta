title: R Interface to the 'UNU.RAN' Random Variate Generators
maintainer: Josef Leydold
description: |-
  Interface to the 'UNU.RAN' library for Universal Non-Uniform RANdom variate generators.
  Thus it allows to build non-uniform random number generators from quite arbitrary
  distributions. In particular, it provides an algorithm for fast numerical inversion
  for distribution with given density function.
  In addition, the package contains densities, distribution functions and quantiles
  from a couple of distributions.
