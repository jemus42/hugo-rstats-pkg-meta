  A collection of methods for left-censored missing data
  imputation
maintainer: Cosmin Lazar
description: 'The package contains a collection of functions for left-censored missing
  data imputation. Left-censoring is a special case of missing not at random (MNAR)  mechanism
  that generates non-responses in proteomics experiments. The package also contains
  functions to artificially generate peptide/protein expression data (log-transformed)
  as random draws from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as well as a function
  to generate missing data (both randomly and non-randomly). For comparison reasons,
  the package also contains several wrapper functions for the imputation of non-responses
  that are missing at random. * New functionality has been added: a hybrid method
  that allows the imputation of missing values in a more complex scenario where the
  missing data are both MAR and MNAR.'
