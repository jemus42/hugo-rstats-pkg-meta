title: Statistical Methods for Interval Censored Data
maintainer: Paul Walter
description: Functions that provide statistical methods for interval censored (grouped)
  data. The package supports the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression
  models with interval censored dependent variables. Parameter estimates are obtained
  by a stochastic expectation maximization algorithm. Furthermore, the package enables
  the direct (without covariates) estimation of statistical indicators from interval
  censored data via an iterative kernel density algorithm. Survey and Organisation
  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) weights can be included into the
  direct estimation (see, Walter, P. (2019) <doi:10.17169/refubium-1621>).
