title: Semiparametric elicitation
maintainer: Bjoern Bornkamp
description: This package implements a novel method for fitting a<U+000a>bounded probability
  distribution to quantiles (for example<U+000a>stated by an expert), see Bornkamp
  and Ickstadt (2009) for<U+000a>details.  For this purpose B-splines are used, and
  the density<U+000a>is obtained by penalized least squares based on a Brier entropy<U+000a>penalty.  The
  package provides methods for fitting the<U+000a>distribution as well as methods
  for evaluating the underlying<U+000a>density and cdf. In addition methods for plotting
  the<U+000a>distribution, drawing random numbers and calculating quantiles<U+000a>of
  the obtained distribution are provided.
