title: Coordinate System Transformations for Generic Map Data
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Transform coordinates from a specified source to a specified
  target map projection. This uses the 'PROJ' library directly, by wrapping the
  'PROJ' package (if functional), otherwise the 'proj4' package. The 'reproj()'
  function is generic, methods may be added to remove the need for an explicit
  source definition. If 'proj4' is in use 'reproj()' handles the requirement for
  conversion of angular units where necessary. This is for use primarily to
  transform generic data formats and direct leverage of the underlying
  'PROJ' library. (There are transformations that aren't possible with 'PROJ' and
  that are provided by the 'GDAL' library, a limitation which users of this
  package should be aware of.) The 'PROJ' library is available at
  <https://proj.org/>.
