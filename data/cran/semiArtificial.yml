title: Generator of Semi-Artificial Data
maintainer: Marko Robnik-Sikonja
description: |-
  Contains methods to generate and evaluate semi-artificial data sets.
  Based on a given data set different methods learn data properties using machine learning algorithms and
  generate new data with the same properties.
  The package currently includes the following data generators:
  i) a RBF network based generator using rbfDDA() from package 'RSNNS',
  ii) a Random Forest based generator for both classification and regression problems
  iii) a density forest based generator for unsupervised data
  Data evaluation support tools include:
  a) single attribute based statistical evaluation: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, medcouple, L/RMC, KS test, Hellinger distance
  b) evaluation based on clustering using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and FM
  c) evaluation based on classification performance with various learning models, e.g., random forests.
