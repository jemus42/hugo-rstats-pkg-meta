title: Multivariate, Locally Stationary Wavelet Process Estimation
maintainer: Simon Taylor
description: 'Tools for analysing multivariate time series with wavelets. This includes:
  simulation of a multivariate locally stationary wavelet (mvLSW) process from a multivariate
  evolutionary wavelet spectrum (mvEWS); estimation of the mvEWS, local coherence
  and local partial coherence. See Park, Eckley and Ombao (2014) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2014.2343937>
  for details.'
