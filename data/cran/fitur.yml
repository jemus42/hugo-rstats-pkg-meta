version: 0.6.1
title: Fit Univariate Distributions
maintainer: Thomas Roh
description: Wrapper for computing parameters for univariate distributions using MLE.
  It creates an object that stores d, p, q, r functions as well as parameters and
  statistics for diagnostics. Currently supports automated fitting from base and actuar
  packages. A manually fitting distribution fitting function is included to support
  directly specifying parameters for any distribution from ancillary packages.
