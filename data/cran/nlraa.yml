description: Additional nonlinear regression functions using self-start (SS) algorithms.
  One of the functions is the Beta growth function proposed by Yin et al. (2003) <doi:10.1093/aob/mcg029>.
  There are several other functions with breakpoints (e.g. linear-plateau, plateau-linear,
  exponential-plateau, plateau-exponential, quadratic-plateau, plateau-quadratic and
  bilinear), a non-rectangular hyperbola and a bell-shaped curve. Twenty one (21)
  new self-start (SS) functions in total. This package also supports the publication
  'Nonlinear regression Models and applications in agricultural research' by Archontoulis
  and Miguez (2015) <doi:10.2134/agronj2012.0506>, a book chapter with similar material
  <doi:10.2134/appliedstatistics.2016.0003.c15> and a publication by Oddi et. al.
  (2019) in Ecology and Evolution <doi:10.1002/ece3.5543>. The function 'nlsLMList'
  uses nlsLM for fitting, but it is otherwise almost identical to 'nlme::nlsList'.In
  addition, this release of the package provides functions for conducting simulation
  for 'nlme' and 'gnls' objects as well as bootstrapping. These functions are intended
  to work with the modeling framework of the 'nlme' package. It also provides four
  vignettes with extended examples.
