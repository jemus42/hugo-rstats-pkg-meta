title: A Visual Tool for Behavior Analysis over Time
maintainer: Elodie Garnier
description: A graphical R package designed to visualize behavioral observations over
  time. Based on raw time data extracted from video recorded sessions of experimental
  observations, ViSiElse grants a global overview of a process by combining the visualization
  of multiple actions timestamps for all participants in a single graph. Individuals
  and/or group behavior can easily be assessed. Supplementary features allow users
  to further inspect their data by adding summary statistics (mean, standard deviation,
  quantile or statistical test) and/or time constraints to assess the accuracy of
  the realized actions.
