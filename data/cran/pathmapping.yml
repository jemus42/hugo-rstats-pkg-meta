title: Compute Deviation and Correspondence Between Spatial Paths
maintainer: Shane T. Mueller
description: 'Functions to compute and display the area-based deviation between spatial
  paths and to compute a mapping based on minimizing area and distance-based cost.  For
  details, see: Mueller, S. T., Perelman, B. S., & Veinott, E. S. (2016) <DOI:10.3758/s13428-015-0562-7>.'
