title: Sampling Methods for Big Data
maintainer: Jonathan Lisic
description: Select sampling methods for probability samples using large data sets.  This
  includes spatially balanced sampling in multi-dimensional spaces with any prescribed
  inclusion probabilities. All implementations are written in C with efficient data
  structures such as k-d trees that easily scale to several million rows on a modern
  desktop computer.
