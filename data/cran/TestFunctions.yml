  Test Functions for Simulation Experiments and Evaluating
  Optimization and Emulation Algorithms
maintainer: Collin Erickson
description: |-
  Test functions are often used to test computer code.
  They are used in optimization to test algorithms and in
  metamodeling to evaluate model predictions. This package provides
  test functions that can be used for any purpose.
  Some functions are taken from <https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano>, but
  their R code is not used.
