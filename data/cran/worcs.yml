maintainer: Caspar J. van Lissa
description: |-
  Create reproducible and transparent research projects in 'R', with
  a minimal amount of code. This package is based on the Workflow for Open
  Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS), a step-by-step procedure based on best
  practices for
  Open Science. It includes an 'RStudio' project template, several
  convenience functions, and all dependencies required to make your project
  reproducible and transparent. WORCS is explained in the tutorial paper
  by Van Lissa, Brandmaier, Brinkman, & Vreede (2020)
