title: Extended RC Models for Contingency Tables
maintainer: Francesco Bartolucci
description: Maximum likelihood estimation of an extended class of row-column (RC)
  association models for two-dimensional contingency tables, which are formulated
  by a condition of reduced rank on a matrix of extended association parameters; see
  Forcina (2019) <arXiv:1910.13848>. These parameters are defined by choosing the
  logit type for the row and column variables among four different options and a transformation
  derived from suitable divergence measures.
