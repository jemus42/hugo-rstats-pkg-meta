title: Detecting New Signals under Background Mismodelling
maintainer: Sara Algeri
description: Given a postulated model and a set of data, the comparison density is
  estimated and the deviance test is implemented in order to assess if the data distribution
  deviates significantly from the postulated model. Finally, the results are summarized
  in a CD-plot as described in Algeri S. (2019) <arXiv:1906.06615>.
