description: Provides a practical tool for estimating the burden of common communicable
  diseases in settlements of displaced populations. An online version of the tool
  can be found at <http://who-refugee-bod.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/shiny/app/>. Estimates of
  burden of disease aim to synthesize data about cause-specific morbidity and mortality
  through a systematic approach that enables evidence-based decisions and comparisons
  across settings. The focus of this tool is on four acute communicable diseases and
  syndromes, including Acute respiratory infections, Acute diarrheal diseases, Acute
  jaundice syndrome and Acute febrile illnesses.
