title: Joint Feature Screening via Sparse MLE
maintainer: Qianxiang Zang
description: Variable selection techniques are essential tools for model selection
  and estimation in high-dimensional statistical models. Sparse Maximal Likelihood
  Estimator (SMLE) (Xu and Chen (2014)<doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.879531>) provides
  an efficient implementation for the joint feature screening method on high-dimensional
  generalized linear models. It also conducts a post-screening selection based on
  user-specified selection criterion. The algorithm uses iterative hard thresholding
  along with parallel computing.
