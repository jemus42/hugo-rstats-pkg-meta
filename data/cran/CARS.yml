description: It implements the CARS procedure, which is a two-sample multiple testing
  procedure that utilizes an additional auxiliary variable to capture the sparsity
  information, hence improving power. The CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotically
  valid and optimal for FDR control. For more information, please see the website
  <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/Papers/CARS.html> and the accompanying paper.
