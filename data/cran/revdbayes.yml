title: Ratio-of-Uniforms Sampling for Bayesian Extreme Value Analysis
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
  models.  The 'rust' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is
  used to simulate a random sample from the required posterior distribution.
  The functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes' package
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes>, which uses Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior simulation.  Also provided
  are functions for making inferences about the extremal index, using
  the K-gaps model of Suveges and Davison (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292>.
  Also provided are d,p,q,r functions for the Generalised Extreme Value
  ('GEV') and Generalised Pareto ('GP') distributions that deal
  appropriately with cases where the shape parameter is very close to zero.
