version: '1.1'
title: Tools for Managing SSH and Git Credentials
maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Setup and retrieve HTTPS and SSH credentials for use with 'git' and
  other services. For HTTPS remotes the package interfaces the 'git-credential'
  utility which 'git' uses to store HTTP usernames and passwords. For SSH
  remotes we provide convenient functions to find or generate appropriate SSH
  keys. The package both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and
  also provides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate with
  existing user credentials.
