title: Inference in Meta Analysis and Meta Regression
maintainer: Thomas W. D. MÃ¶bius
description: |-
  Provides methods for making inference in the random effects meta
  regression model such as point estimates and confidence intervals for the
  heterogeneity parameter and the regression coefficients vector.  Inference
  methods are based on different approaches to statistical inference.
  Methods from three different schools are included: methods based on the
  method of moments approach, methods based on likelihood, and methods based
  on generalised inference.  The package also includes tools to run extensive
  simulation studies in parallel on high performance clusters in a modular
  way.  This allows extensive testing of custom inferential methods with all
  implemented state-of-the-art methods in a standardised way.  Tools for
  evaluating the performance of both point and interval estimates are
  provided.  Also, a large collection of different pre-defined plotting
  functions is implemented in a ready-to-use fashion.
