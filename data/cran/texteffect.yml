  Discovering Latent Treatments in Text Corpora and Estimating
  Their Causal Effects
maintainer: Christian Fong
description: |-
  Implements the approach described in Fong and Grimmer (2016) <https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1151.pdf> for
  automatically discovering latent treatments from a corpus and estimating the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of
  each treatment.  The data is divided into a training and test set.  The supervised Indian Buffet Process (sibp) is used
  to discover latent treatments in the training set.  The fitted model is then applied to the test set to infer the values
  of the latent treatments in the test set.  Finally, Y is regressed on the latent treatments in the test set to estimate
  the causal effect of each treatment.
