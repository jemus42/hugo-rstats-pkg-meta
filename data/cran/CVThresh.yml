title: Level-Dependent Cross-Validation Thresholding
maintainer: Donghoh Kim
description: This package carries out level-dependent cross-validation<U+000a>method
  for the selection of thresholding value in wavelet<U+000a>shrinkage. This procedure
  is implemented by coupling a<U+000a>conventional cross validation with an imputation
  method due to<U+000a>a limitation of data length, a power of 2. It can be easily<U+000a>applied
  to classical leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation.<U+000a>Since the procedure
  is computationally fast, a level-dependent<U+000a>cross validation can be performed
  for wavelet shrinkage of<U+000a>various data such as a data with correlated errors.
