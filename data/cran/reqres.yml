title: Powerful Classes for HTTP Requests and Responses
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  In order to facilitate parsing of http requests and creating
  appropriate responses this package provides two classes to handle a lot of
  the housekeeping involved in working with http exchanges. The infrastructure
  builds upon the 'rook' specification and is thus well suited to be combined
  with 'httpuv' based web servers.
