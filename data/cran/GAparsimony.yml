title: Searching Parsimony Models with Genetic Algorithms
maintainer: F.J. Martinez-de-Pison
description: Methodology that combines feature selection, model tuning, and parsimonious
  model selection with Genetic Algorithms (GA) proposed in {Martinez-de-Pison} (2015)
  <DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2015.06.012>. To this objective, a novel GA selection procedure
  is introduced based on separate cost and complexity evaluations.
