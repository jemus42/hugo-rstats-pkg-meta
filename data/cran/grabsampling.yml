title: Probability of Detection for Grab Sample Selection
maintainer: Mayooran Thevaraja
description: Functions for obtaining the probability of detection, for grab samples
  selection by using two different methods such as systematic or random based on two-state
  Markov chain model. For detection probability calculation, we used results from
  Bhat, U. and Lal, R. (1988) <doi:10.2307/1427041>.
