title: Multiple Imputation Using Weighted Quantile Sum Regression
maintainer: Paul M. Hargarten
description: 'The `miWQS` package handles the uncertainty due to below the detection
  limit in a correlated component mixture problem.  Researchers want to determine
  if a set/mixture of continuous and correlated components/chemicals is associated
  with an outcome and if so, which components are important in that mixture. These
  components share a common outcome but are interval-censored between zero and low
  thresholds, or detection limits, that may be different across the components. The
  `miWQS` package applies the multiple imputation (MI) procedure to the weighted quantile
  sum regression (WQS) methodology for continuous, binary, or count outcomes.  The
  imputation models are: bootstrapping imputation (Lubin et.al (2004) <doi:10.1289/ehp.7199>)
  and Bayesian imputation.'
