title: Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections in R
maintainer: Tim Appelhans
description: |-
  Empirical orthogonal teleconnections in R.
  'remote' is short for 'R(-based) EMpirical Orthogonal TEleconnections'.
  It implements a collection of functions to facilitate empirical
  orthogonal teleconnection analysis. Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections
  (EOTs) denote a regression based approach to decompose spatio-temporal
  fields into a set of independent orthogonal patterns. They are quite
  similar to Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) with EOTs producing
  less abstract results. In contrast to EOFs, which are orthogonal in both
  space and time, EOT analysis produces patterns that are orthogonal in
  either space or time.
