title: Alternating Minimization Induced Active Set Algorithms
maintainer: Canhong Wen
description: An implementation of alternating minimization induced active set (AMIAS)
  method for solving the generalized L0 problem. The AMIAS method is based on the
  necessary optimality conditions derived from an augmented Lagrangian framework.
  The proposed method takes full advantage of the primal and dual variables with complementary
  supports, and decouples the high-dimensional problem into two sub-systems on the
  active and inactive sets, respectively. A sequential AMIAS algorithm with warm start
  initialization is developed for efficient determination of the cardinality parameter,
  along with the output of solution paths.
