  Joint Modelling of Multivariate Longitudinal Data and
  Time-to-Event Outcomes
maintainer: Graeme L. Hickey
description: |-
  Fits the joint model proposed by Henderson and colleagues (2000)
  <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465>, but extended to the case of multiple
  continuous longitudinal measures. The time-to-event data is modelled using a
  Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying covariates. The
  multiple longitudinal outcomes are modelled using a multivariate version of the
  Laird and Ware linear mixed model. The association is captured by a multivariate
  latent Gaussian process. The model is estimated using a Monte Carlo Expectation
  Maximization algorithm. This project is funded by the Medical Research Council
  (Grant number MR/M013227/1).
