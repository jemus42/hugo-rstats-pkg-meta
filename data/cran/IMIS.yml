description: 'IMIS algorithm draws samples from the posterior<U+000a>distribution.
  The user has to define the following R functions<U+000a>in advance: prior(x) calculates
  prior density of x,<U+000a>likelihood(x) calculates the likelihood of x, and<U+000a>sample.prior(n)
  draws n samples from the prior distribution.'
