title: Compute and Display Tendril Plots
maintainer: Stefano Borini
description: |-
  Compute the coordinates to produce a tendril plot.
  In the tendril plot, each tendril (branch) represents a type of events,
  and the direction of the tendril is dictated by on which treatment arm the
  event is occurring. If an event is occurring on the first of the two
  specified treatment arms, the tendril bends in a clockwise direction.
  If an event is occurring on the second of the treatment arms, the
  tendril bends in an anti-clockwise direction.
