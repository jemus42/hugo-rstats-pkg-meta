maintainer: Marvin N. Wright
description: |-
  A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
  dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
  probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association
  studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
  class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') and 'dgCMatrix' (R package 'Matrix')
  can be directly analyzed.
