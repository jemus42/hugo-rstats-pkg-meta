title: Masked User Input
maintainer: Drew Schmidt
description: |-
  A micro-package for reading "passwords", i.e.  reading
  user input with masking, so that the input is not displayed as it
  is typed.  Currently we have support for 'RStudio', the command line
  (every OS), and any platform where 'tcltk' is present.
