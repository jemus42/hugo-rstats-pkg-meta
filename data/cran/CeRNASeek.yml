title: Identification and Analysis of ceRNA Regulation
maintainer: Mengying Zhang
description: |-
  Provides several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge, including
  popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions, two types
  of global ceRNA regulation prediction methods and four types of context-specific
  prediction methods( Li Y et al.(2017) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137>), which are based
  on miRNA-messenger RNA regulation alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data,
  respectively. In addition, For predictive ceRNA relationship pairs, this package
  provides several downstream analysis algorithms, including regulatory network
  analysis and functional annotation analysis, as well as survival prognosis analysis
  based on expression of ceRNA ternary pair.
