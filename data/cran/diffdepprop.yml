title: Calculates Confidence Intervals for two Dependent Proportions
maintainer: Daniela Wenzel
description: The package includes functions to calculate confidence<U+000a>intervals
  for the difference of dependent proportions. There<U+000a>are two functions implemented
  to edit the data (dichotomising<U+000a>with the help of cutpoints, counting accordance
  and discordance<U+000a>of two tests or situations). For the calculation of the<U+000a>confidence
  intervals entries of the fourfold table are needed.
