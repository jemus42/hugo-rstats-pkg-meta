  Kind from Grouped Data
maintainer: Vanesa Jorda
description: |-
  Estimation of the generalized beta distribution of the second
  kind (GB2) and related models using grouped data in form of income shares.
  The GB2 family is a general class of distributions that provides an accurate
  fit to income data. 'GB2group' includes functions to estimate the GB2, the
  Singh-Maddala, the Dagum, the Beta 2, the Lognormal and the Fisk distributions.
  'GB2group' deploys two different econometric strategies to estimate these
  parametric distributions, non-linear least squares (NLS) and the generalised
  method of moments (GMM). Asymptotic standard errors are reported for the
  GMM estimates. Standard errors of the NLS estimates are obtained by Monte
  Carlo simulation. See Jorda et al. (2018) <arXiv:1808.09831> for a detailed
  description of the estimation procedure.
