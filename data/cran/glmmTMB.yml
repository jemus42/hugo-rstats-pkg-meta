title: Generalized Linear Mixed Models using Template Model Builder
maintainer: Mollie Brooks
description: |-
  Fit linear and generalized linear mixed models with various
  extensions, including zero-inflation. The models are fitted using maximum
  likelihood estimation via 'TMB' (Template Model Builder). Random effects are
  assumed to be Gaussian on the scale of the linear predictor and are integrated
  out using the Laplace approximation. Gradients are calculated using automatic
  differentiation.
