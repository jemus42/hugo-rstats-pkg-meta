description: |-
  Provides access to coded election programmes from the Manifesto
  Corpus and to the Manifesto Project's Main Dataset and routines to analyse this
  data. The Manifesto Project <https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu> collects and
  analyses election programmes across time and space to measure the political
  preferences of parties. The Manifesto Corpus contains the collected and
  annotated election programmes in the Corpus format of the package 'tm' to enable
  easy use of text processing and text mining functionality. Specific functions
  for scaling of coded political texts are included.
