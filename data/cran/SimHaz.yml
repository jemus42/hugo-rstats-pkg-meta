  Exposure
maintainer: Nusrat Rabbee
description: Generate power for the Cox proportional hazards model by simulating survival
  events data with time dependent exposure status for subjects. A dichotomous exposure
  variable is considered with a single transition from unexposed to exposed status
  during the subject's time on study.
