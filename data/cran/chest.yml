title: Change-in-Estimate Approach to Assess Confounding Effects
maintainer: Zhiqiang Wang
description: |-
  Applies the change-in-effect estimate method to assess confounding
  effects in medical and epidemiological research (Greenland & Pearce (2016)
  <doi:10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122559> ). It starts with a crude model
  including only the outcome and exposure variables. At each of the subsequent
  steps, one variable which creates the largest change among the remaining variables
  is selected. This process is repeated until all variables have been entered into
  the model (Wang Z (2007) <doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203> ). Currently, the 'chest'
  package has functions for linear regression, logistic regression, negative
  binomial regression, Cox proportional hazards model and conditional logistic
  regression.
