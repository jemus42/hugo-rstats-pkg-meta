  Statistical Functions for the Censored and Uncensored
  Epanechnikov Distribution
maintainer: Mathias Borritz Milfeldt
description: Analyzing censored variables usually requires the use of optimization
  algorithms. This package provides an alternative algebraic approach to the task
  of determining the expected value of a random censored variable with a known censoring
  point. Likewise this approach allows for the determination of the censoring point
  if the expected value is known. These results are derived under the assumption that
  the variable follows an Epanechnikov kernel distribution with known mean and range
  prior to censoring. Statistical functions related to the uncensored Epanechnikov
  distribution are also provided by this package.
