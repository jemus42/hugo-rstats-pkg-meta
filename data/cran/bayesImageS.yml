title: Bayesian Methods for Image Segmentation using a Potts Model
maintainer: Matt Moores
description: |-
  Various algorithms for segmentation of 2D and 3D images, such
  as computed tomography and satellite remote sensing. This package implements
  Bayesian image analysis using the hidden Potts model with external field
  prior of Moores et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2014.12.001>.
  Latent labels are sampled using chequerboard updating or Swendsen-Wang.
  Algorithms for the smoothing parameter include pseudolikelihood, path sampling,
  the exchange algorithm, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC-MCMC and ABC-SMC),
  and the parametric functional approximate Bayesian (PFAB) algorithm. Refer to
  <doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9525-6> and <doi:10.1214/18-BA1130> for further details.
