title: The Gumbel Distribution Functions and Gradients
maintainer: Berent Ånund Strømnes Lunde
description: |-
  Gumbel distribution functions (De Haan L. (2007)
  <doi:10.1007/0-387-34471-3>) implemented with the techniques of automatic
  differentiation (Griewank A. (2008) <isbn:978-0-89871-659-7>).
  With this tool, a user should be able to quickly model extreme
  events for which the Gumbel distribution is the domain of attraction.
  The package makes available the density function, the distribution
  function the quantile function and a random generating function. In
  addition, it supports gradient functions. The package combines 'Adept'
  (C++ templated automatic differentiation) (Hogan R. (2017)
  <doi:10.5281/zenodo.1004730>) and 'Eigen' (templated matrix-vector
  library) for fast computations of both objective functions and exact
  gradients. It relies on 'RcppEigen' for easy access to 'Eigen' and
  bindings to R.
