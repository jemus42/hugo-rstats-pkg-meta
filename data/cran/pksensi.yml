  Global Sensitivity Analysis in Physiologically Based Kinetic
  Modeling
maintainer: Nan-Hung Hsieh
description: Applying the global sensitivity analysis workflow to investigate the
  parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in physiologically based kinetic (PK) models,
  especially the physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic model with multivariate
  outputs. The package also provides some functions to check the convergence and sensitivity
  of model parameters.
