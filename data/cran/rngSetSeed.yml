title: Seeding the Default RNG with a Numeric Vector
maintainer: Petr Savicky
description: |-
  A function setVectorSeed() is provided. Its argument
  is a numeric vector of an arbitrary nonzero length, whose
  components have integer values from [0, 2^32-1]. The input
  vector is transformed using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  algorithm into an initial state of Mersenne-Twister random
  number generator. The function provides a better alternative
  to the R base function set.seed(), if the input vector is
  a single integer. Initializing a stream of random numbers
  with a vector is a convenient way to obtain several streams,
  each of which is identified by several integer indices.
