  Algorithm
maintainer: Jose Brito
description: |-
  An Optimization Algorithm Applied
  to stratification Problem.
  It is aims to delimit the population strata
  and defining the allocation of sample,considering
  the following objective: minimize the sample size given
  a fixed precision level. Exhaustive enumeration method
  is applied in small problems, while in problems with greater
  complexity the algorithm is based on metaheuristic Variable
  Neighborhood Decomposition Search with Path Relink.
