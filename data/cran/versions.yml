title: Query and Install Specific Versions of Packages on CRAN
maintainer: Nick Golding
description: |-
  Installs specified versions of R packages hosted on CRAN and
  provides functions to list available versions and the versions of currently
  installed packages. These tools can be used to help make R projects and
  packages more reproducible. 'versions' fits in the narrow gap between
  the 'devtools' install_version() function and the 'checkpoint' package.
  devtools::install_version() installs a stated package version from source files
  stored on the CRAN archives. However CRAN does not store binary versions of
  packages so Windows users need to have RTools installed and Windows and OSX
  users get longer installation times. 'checkpoint' uses the Revolution Analytics
  MRAN server to install packages (from source or binary) as they were available
  on a given date. It also provides a helpful interface to detect the packages
  in use in a directory and install all of those packages for a given date.
  'checkpoint' doesn't provide install.packages-like functionality however, and
  that's what 'versions' aims to do, by querying MRAN. As MRAN only goes back to
  2014-09-17, 'versions' can't install packages archived before this date.
