maintainer: Matthias Bannert
description: |-
  Aggregate Business Tendency Survey Data (and other qualitative
  surveys) to time series at various aggregation levels. Run aggregation of
  survey data in a speedy, re-traceable and a easily deployable way.
  Aggregation is substantially accelerated by use of data.table.
  This package intends to provide an interface that is less general and abstract than data.table but rather geared towards
  survey researchers.
