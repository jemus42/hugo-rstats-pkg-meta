title: Finite Mixture Modeling for Raw and Binned Data
maintainer: Youjiao Yu
description: Performs maximum likelihood estimation for finite mixture models for
  families including Normal, Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal by using EM algorithm, together
  with Newton-Raphson algorithm or bisection method when necessary. It also conducts
  mixture model selection by using information criteria or bootstrap likelihood ratio
  test. The data used for mixture model fitting can be raw data or binned data. The
  model fitting process is accelerated by using R package 'Rcpp'.
