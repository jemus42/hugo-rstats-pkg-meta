title: Entropy reweighting to create balanced samples
maintainer: Jens Hainmueller
description: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure
  that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in
  the reweighted data satisfy a set of user specified moment conditions. This can
  be useful to create balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment
  where the control group data can be reweighted to match the covariate moments in
  the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample
  to known characteristics from a target population.
