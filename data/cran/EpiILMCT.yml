  Continuous Time Distance-Based and Network-Based Individual
  Level Models for Epidemics
maintainer: Waleed Almutiry
description: Provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models
  of disease transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with
  the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based and/or contact
  network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed
  (SINR) compartmental frameworks. An overview of the implemented continuous-time
  individual level models for epidemics is given by Almutiry and Deardon (2019) <doi:10.1515/ijb-2017-0092>.
