title: Composite Gaussian Process Models
maintainer: Shan Ba
description: Fit composite Gaussian process (CGP) models as described in Ba and Joseph
  (2012) "Composite Gaussian Process Models for Emulating Expensive Functions", Annals
  of Applied Statistics. The CGP model is capable of approximating complex surfaces
  that are not second-order stationary.  Important functions in this package are CGP,
  print.CGP, summary.CGP, predict.CGP and plotCGP.
