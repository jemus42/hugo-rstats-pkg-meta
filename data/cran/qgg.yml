description: |-
  Provides an infrastructure for efficient processing of large-scale genetic and phenotypic data including core functions for: 1) fitting linear mixed models, 2) constructing marker-based genomic relationship matrices, 3) estimating genetic parameters (heritability and correlation), 4) performing genomic prediction and genetic risk profiling, and 5) single or multi-marker association analyses.
