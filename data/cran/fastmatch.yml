title: Fast match() function
maintainer: Simon Urbanek
description: |-
  Package providing a fast match() replacement for cases
  that require repeated look-ups. It is slightly faster that R's
  built-in match() function on first match against a table, but
  extremely fast on any subsequent lookup as it keeps the hash
  table in memory.
