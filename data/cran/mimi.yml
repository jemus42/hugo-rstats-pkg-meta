title: Main Effects and Interactions in Mixed and Incomplete Data
maintainer: Genevieve Robin
description: Generalized low-rank models for mixed and incomplete data frames. The
  main function may be used for dimensionality reduction of imputation of numeric,
  binary and count data (simultaneously). Main effects such as column means, group
  effects, or effects of row-column side information (e.g. user/item attributes in
  recommendation system) may also be modelled in addition to the low-rank model. Geneviève
  Robin, Olga Klopp, Julie Josse, Éric Moulines, Robert Tibshirani (2018) <arXiv:1806.09734>.
