title: Complexity of Short and Coarse-Grained Time Series
maintainer: Tim Kaiser
description: While there are many well-established measures for identifying critical
  fluctuations and phase transitions, these measures only work with many points of
  measurement and thus are unreliable when studying short and coarse-grained time
  series. This package provides a measure for complexity in a time series that does
  not rely on long time series (Kaiser (2017), <doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/GWTKX>).
