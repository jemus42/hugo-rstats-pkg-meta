title: Fast Cross-Validation via Sequential Testing
maintainer: Tammo Krueger
description: The fast cross-validation via sequential testing (CVST) procedure is
  an improved cross-validation procedure which uses non-parametric testing coupled
  with sequential analysis to determine the best parameter set on linearly increasing
  subsets of the data. By eliminating under-performing candidates quickly and keeping
  promising candidates as long as possible, the method speeds up the computation while
  preserving the capability of a full cross-validation. Additionally to the CVST the
  package contains an implementation of the ordinary k-fold cross-validation with
  a flexible and powerful set of helper objects and methods to handle the overall
  model selection process. The implementations of the Cochran's Q test with permutations
  and the sequential testing framework of Wald are generic and can therefore also
  be used in other contexts.
