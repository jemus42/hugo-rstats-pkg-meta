maintainer: Tim Riffe
description: Utilities for reading data from the Human Mortality Database (<https://www.mortality.org>),
  Human Fertility Database (<https://www.humanfertility.org>), and similar databases
  from the web or locally into an R session as data.frame objects. These are the two
  most widely used sources of demographic data to study basic demographic change,
  trends, and develop new demographic methods. Other supported databases at this time
  include the Human Fertility Collection (<http://www.fertilitydata.org/>), The Japanese
  Mortality Database (<http://www.ipss.go.jp/p-toukei/JMD>), and the Canadian Human
  Mortality Database (<http://www.bdlc.umontreal.ca/chmd/>). Arguments and data are
  standardized.
