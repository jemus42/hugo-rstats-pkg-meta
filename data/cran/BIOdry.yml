title: Multilevel Modeling of Dendroclimatical Fluctuations
maintainer: Wilson Lara
description: Multilevel ecological data series (MEDS) are sequences of observations
  ordered according to temporal/spatial hierarchies that are defined by sample designs,
  with sample variability confined to ecological factors. Dendroclimatic MEDS of tree
  rings and climate are modeled into normalized fluctuations of tree growth and aridity.  Modeled
  fluctuations (model frames) are compared with Mantel correlograms on multiple levels
  defined by sample design. Package implementation can be understood by running examples
  in modelFrame(), and muleMan() functions.
