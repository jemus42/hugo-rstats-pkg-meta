title: Analyze Shot Group Data
maintainer: Daniel Wollschlaeger
description: |-
  Analyzes shooting data with respect to group shape,
  precision, and accuracy. This includes graphical methods,
  descriptive statistics, and inference tests using standard,
  but also non-parametric and robust statistical methods.
  Implements distributions for radial error in bivariate normal
  variables. Works with files exported by 'OnTarget PC/TDS',
  'Silver Mountain' e-target, 'ShotMarker' e-target, or 'Taran',
  as well as with custom data files in text format.
  Supports inference from range statistics like extreme spread.
  Includes a set of web-based graphical user interfaces.
