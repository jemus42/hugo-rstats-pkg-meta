title: Translate English Words into Chinese Words
maintainer: Xinyuan Chu
description: |-
  If translate English words into Chinese, you might consider
  looking up a dictionary or online query, in fact, there is a faster
  way for R user. Ke-Hao Wu (2014) <RYoudaoTranslate: R package provide
  functions to translate English words into Chinese.> provides interface
  to Youdao translation open API for R user. But this software is not
  very friendly to use, I have made some improvements on the basis of
  this software. You can pass in a words or a vector consisting of multiple
  words, which will return the corresponding type of Chinese representation
  and be easy to reuse.
