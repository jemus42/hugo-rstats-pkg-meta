title: Transforms Contingency Tables to Data Frames, and Analyses Them
maintainer: Scott D. Graham
description: |-
  Contingency Tables are a pain to work with when you want to run regressions.
  This package takes them, flattens them into a long data frame, so you can more easily analyse them!
  As well, you can calculate other related statistics. All of this is done so in a 'tidy' manner,
  so it should tie in nicely with 'tidyverse' series of packages.
