title: A Tidy Approach to 'NetCDF' Data Exploration and Extraction
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Tidy tools for 'NetCDF' data sources. Explore the contents of a
  'NetCDF' source (file or URL) presented as variables organized by grid with a
  database-like interface. The hyper_filter() interactive function translates the
  filter value or index expressions to array-slicing form. No data is read until
  explicitly requested, as a data frame or list of arrays via hyper_tibble() or
  hyper_array().
