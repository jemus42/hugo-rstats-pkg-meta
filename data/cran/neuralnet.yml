title: Training of Neural Networks
maintainer: Marvin N. Wright
description: |-
  Training of neural networks using backpropagation,
  resilient backpropagation with (Riedmiller, 1994) or without
  weight backtracking (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) or the
  modified globally convergent version by Anastasiadis et al.
  (2005). The package allows flexible settings through
  custom-choice of error and activation function. Furthermore,
  the calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O & Intrator
  N, 1993) is implemented.
