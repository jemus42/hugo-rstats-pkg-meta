title: Compute Node Overlap and Segregation in Ecological Networks
maintainer: Thomas J. Matthews
description: |-
  Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and
  the associated metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015)
  <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12395> and Strona et al. (2017, In Press).
  The functions provided in the package enable assessment of
  structural patterns ranging from complete node segregation to perfect
  nestedness in a variety of network types. In addition, they provide a
  measure of network modularity.
