title: Distance Object Manipulation Tools
maintainer: Zachary Colburn
description: Provides convenient methods for accessing the data in 'dist' objects
  with minimal memory and computational overhead. 'disttools' can be used to extract
  the distance between any pair or combination of points encoded by a 'dist' object
  using only the indices of those points. This is an improvement over existing functionality,
  which requires either coercing a 'dist' object into a matrix or calculating the
  one dimensional index corresponding to a pair of observations. Coercion to a matrix
  is undesirable because doing so doubles the amount of memory required for storage.
  In contrast, there is no inherent downside to the latter solution. However, in part
  due to several edge cases, correctly and efficiently implementing such a solution
  can be challenging. 'disttools' abstracts away these challenges and provides a simple
  interface to access the data in a 'dist' object using the latter approach.
