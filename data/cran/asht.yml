description: |-
  Gives some hypothesis test functions (sign test, median and other quantile tests,
  Wilcoxon signed rank test, coefficient of variation test, test of normal variance,
  test on weighted sums of Poisson [see Fay and Kim <doi:10.1002/bimj.201600111>],
  sample size for t-tests with different variances
  and non-equal n per arm, Behrens-Fisher test, nonparametric ABC intervals,
  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test [with effect estimates and confidence intervals,
  see Fay and Malinovsky <doi:10.1002/sim.7890>], two-sample melding tests
  [see Fay, Proschan, and Brittain <doi:10.1111/biom.12231>],
  one-way ANOVA allowing var.equal=FALSE [see Brown and Forsythe, 1974, Biometrics]).
  The focus is on methods that have compatible confidence intervals.
