  Weighted Nearest Neighbor Imputation of Missing Values using
  Selected Variables
maintainer: Shahla Faisal
description: |-
  New tools for the imputation of missing values in high-dimensional
  data are introduced using the non-parametric nearest neighbor methods. It
  includes weighted nearest neighbor imputation methods that use specific
  distances for selected variables. It includes an automatic procedure of cross
  validation and does not require prespecified values of the tuning parameters.
  It can be used to impute missing values in high-dimensional data when the sample
  size is smaller than the number of predictors. For more information see Faisal
  and Tutz (2017) <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2015-0098>.
