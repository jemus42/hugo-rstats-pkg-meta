title: Power Analysis for Longitudinal Multilevel Models
maintainer: Kristoffer Magnusson
description: |-
  Calculate power for the 'time x treatment' effect
  in two- and three-level multilevel longitudinal studies with missing data.
  Both the third-level factor (e.g. therapists, schools, or physicians),
  and the second-level factor (e.g. subjects), can be assigned random slopes.
  Studies with partially nested designs, unequal cluster sizes,
  unequal allocation to treatment arms, and different dropout patterns
  per treatment are supported. For all designs power can be
  calculated both analytically and via simulations. The analytical
  calculations extends the method described in Galbraith et al. (2002)
  <doi:10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00205-2>, to three-level models.
  Additionally, the simulation tools provides flexible ways to investigate
  bias, Type I errors and the consequences of model misspecification.
