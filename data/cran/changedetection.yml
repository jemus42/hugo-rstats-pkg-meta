  Nonparametric Change Detection in Multivariate Linear
  Relationships
maintainer: Olga Gorskikh
description: Contains implementation of the Nonparametric Splitting Algorithm (NSA),
  which estimates a set of structural change points (change dates) within a multivariate
  time-wise linear regression. Additionally, it contains utility functions to estimate
  corresponding changing linear model, moving energy distance and a change-detection
  test. For more information, see Malo et. al (2019) <arXiv:1805.08512v2>.
