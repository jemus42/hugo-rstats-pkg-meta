title: Wrapper Functions for 'Freesurfer'
maintainer: John Muschelli
description: |-
  Wrapper functions that interface with 'Freesurfer'
  <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>, a powerful and
  commonly-used 'neuroimaging'
  software, using system commands. The goal is to be able to interface with
  'Freesurfer' completely in R, where you pass R objects of class 'nifti',
  implemented by package 'oro.nifti', and the function executes an 'Freesurfer'
  command and returns an R object of class 'nifti' or necessary output.
