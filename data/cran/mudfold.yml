title: Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing
maintainer: Spyros Balafas
description: 'Nonparametric unfolding item response theory (IRT) model for dichotomous
  data (see W.H. Van Schuur (1984). Structure in Political Beliefs: A New Model for
  Stochastic Unfolding with Application to European Party Activists, and W.J.Post
  (1992). Nonparametric Unfolding Models: A Latent Structure Approach). The package
  implements MUDFOLD (Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing), an iterative item selection
  algorithm that constructs unfolding scales from dichotomous preferential-choice
  data without explicitly assuming a parametric form of the item response functions.
  Scale diagnostics from Post(1992) and estimates for the person locations proposed
  by Johnson(2006) and Van Schuur(1984) are also available. This model can be seen
  as the unfolding variant of Mokken(1971) scaling method.'
