maintainer: Volkmar Liebscher
description: Computing Gromov-Hausdorff type l^p distances for labeled metric spaces.
  These distances were introduced in V.Liebscher, Gromov meets Phylogenetics - new
  Animals for the Zoo of Metrics on Tree Space. preprint  arXiv:1504.05795,  for phylogenetic
  trees but may apply to much more situations.
