title: The Skew Hyperbolic Student t-Distribution
maintainer: David Scott
description: |-
  Functions are provided for the density function,
  distribution function, quantiles and random number
  generation for the skew hyperbolic
  t-distribution. There are also functions that fit
  the distribution to data. There are functions for the
  mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and mode of a given
  distribution and to calculate moments of any order about
  any centre. To assess goodness of fit, there are
  functions to generate a Q-Q plot, a P-P plot and a tail plot.
