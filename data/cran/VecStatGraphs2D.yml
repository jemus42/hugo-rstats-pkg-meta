title: Vector Analysis using Graphical and Analytical Methods in 2D
maintainer: Pablo Garcia Rodriguez
description: 'A 2D statistical analysis is performed, both numerical and graphical,
  of a set of vectors. Since a vector has two components (module and azimuth) vector
  analysis is performed in three stages: modules are analyzed by means of linear statistics,
  azimuths are analyzed by circular statistics, and the joint analysis of modules
  and azimuths is done using density maps that allow detecting another distribution
  properties (i.e. anisotropy) and outliers. Tests and circular statistic parameters
  have associated a full range of graphing: histograms, maps of distributions, point
  maps, vector maps, density maps, distribution modules and azimuths.'
