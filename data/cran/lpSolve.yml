title: Interface to 'Lp_solve' v. 5.5 to Solve Linear/Integer Programs
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
  solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this
  implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R
  functions that solve general linear/integer problems,
  assignment problems, and transportation problems. This version
  calls lp_solve version 5.5.
