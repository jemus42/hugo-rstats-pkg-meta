title: Creates Ideal Data for Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Greg McMahan
description: |-
  Have you ever struggled to find "good data" for a generalized linear model? Would you like
  to test how quickly statistics converge to parameters, or learn how picking different
  link functions affects model performance? This package creates ideal data for both common
  and novel generalized linear models so your questions can be empirically answered.
