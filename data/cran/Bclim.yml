title: Bayesian Palaeoclimate Reconstruction from Pollen Data
maintainer: Andrew Parnell
description: |-
  Takes pollen and chronology data from lake cores and produces
  a Bayesian posterior distribution of palaeoclimate from that location after
  fitting a non-linear non-Gaussian state-space model. For more details see the
  paper Parnell et al. (2015), Bayesian inference for palaeoclimate with
  time uncertainty and stochastic volatility. Journal of the Royal Statistical
  Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 64: 115â€“138 <DOI:10.1111/rssc.12065>.
