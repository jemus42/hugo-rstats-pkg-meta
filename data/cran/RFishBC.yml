title: Back-Calculation of Fish Length
maintainer: Derek Ogle
description: |-
  Helps fisheries scientists collect measurements from calcified
  structures and back-calculate estimated lengths at previous ages using
  standard procedures and models. This is intended to replace much of the
  functionality provided by the now out-dated 'fishBC' software
  (<https://fisheries.org/bookstore/all-titles/software/70317/>).
