title: Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr'
maintainer: Dean Attali
description: |-
  An extension of 'knitr' that adds flexibility in several
  ways. One common source of frustration with 'knitr' is that it assumes
  the directory where the source file lives should be the working directory,
  which is often not true. 'ezknitr' addresses this problem by giving you
  complete control over where all the inputs and outputs are, and adds several
  other convenient features to make rendering markdown/HTML documents easier.
