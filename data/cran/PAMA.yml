title: Rank Aggregation with Partition Mallows Model
maintainer: Wanchuang Zhu
description: Rank aggregation aims to achieve a better ranking list given multiple
  observations. 'PAMA' implements Partition-Mallows model for rank aggregation. Both
  Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are provided. It can
  handle partial list as well. When covariates information is available, this package
  can make inference by incorporating the covariate information. More information
  can be found in the paper "Integrated Partition-Mallows Model and Its Inference
  for Rank Aggregation". The paper is not yet published.
