title: Standard Error Adjusted Adaptive Lasso
maintainer: Wei Qian
description: Standard error adjusted adaptive lasso (SEA-lasso) is a version of the
  adaptive lasso, which incorporates OLS standard error to the L1 penalty weight.
  This method is intended for variable selection under linear regression settings
  (n > p). This new weight assignment strategy is especially useful when the collinearity
  of the design matrix is a concern.
