title: Simulation of Chromosomal Regions Shared by Family Members
maintainer: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
description: |-
  Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by
  pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along the human
  genome (Kong et. al (2010) <doi:10.1038/nature09525>), phased chromosomes
  are simulated for all pedigree members, either by unconditional gene
  dropping or conditional on a specified IBD pattern. Additional functions
  provide summaries and further analysis of the simulated genomes.
