title: PepSAVI-MS Data Analysis
maintainer: Pritchard David
description: |-
  An implementation of the data processing and data analysis portion
  of a pipeline named the PepSAVI-MS which is currently under development by
  the Hicks laboratory at the University of North Carolina.  The statistical
  analysis package presented herein provides a collection of software tools
  used to facilitate the prioritization of putative bioactive peptides from a
  complex biological matrix.  Tools are provided to deconvolute mass
  spectrometry features into a single representation for each peptide charge
  state, filter compounds to include only those possibly contributing to the
  observed bioactivity, and prioritize these remaining compounds for those
  most likely contributing to each bioactivity data set.
