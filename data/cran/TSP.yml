title: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
maintainer: Michael Hahsler
description: |-
  Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling
  salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP).
  The package provides some simple algorithms and
  an interface to the Concorde TSP solver and its implementation of the
  Chained-Lin-Kernighan heuristic. The code for Concorde
  itself is not included in the package and has to be obtained separately.
