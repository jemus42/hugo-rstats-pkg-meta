title: Tools to Visualize, Manipulate, and Summarize MCMC Output
maintainer: Casey Youngflesh
description: Performs key functions for MCMC analysis using minimal code - visualizes,
  manipulates, and summarizes MCMC output. Functions support simple and straightforward
  subsetting of model parameters within the calls, and produce presentable and 'publication-ready'
  output. MCMC output may be derived from Bayesian model output fit with JAGS, Stan,
  or other MCMC samplers.
