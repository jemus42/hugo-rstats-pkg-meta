title: Prediction Rule Ensembles
maintainer: Marjolein Fokkema
description: |-
  Derives prediction rule ensembles (PREs). Largely follows the
  procedure for deriving PREs as described in Friedman & Popescu (2008;
  <DOI:10.1214/07-AOAS148>), with adjustments and improvements. The
  main function pre() derives prediction rule ensembles consisting of
  rules and/or linear terms for continuous, binary, count, multinomial,
  and multivariate continuous responses. Function gpe() derives
  generalized prediction ensembles, consisting of rules, hinge and linear
  functions of the predictor variables.
