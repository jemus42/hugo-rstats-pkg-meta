  Entropy weighted k-means (ewkm) by Liping Jing, Michael
  K. Ng and Joshua Zhexue Huang (2007)
  <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2007.1048> is a weighted subspace clustering
  algorithm that is well suited to very high dimensional data.
  Weights are calculated as the importance of a variable with
  regard to cluster membership.  The two-level variable
  weighting clustering algorithm tw-k-means (twkm) by Xiaojun
  Chen, Xiaofei Xu, Joshua Zhexue Huang and Yunming Ye (2013)
  <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2011.262> introduces two types of weights,
  the weights on individual variables and the weights on
  variable groups, and they are calculated during the clustering
  process.  The feature group weighted k-means (fgkm) by Xiaojun
  Chen, Yunminng Ye, Xiaofei Xu and Joshua Zhexue Huang (2012)
  <doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2011.06.004> extends this concept by
  grouping features and weighting the group in addition to
  weighting individual features.
