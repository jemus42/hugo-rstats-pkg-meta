title: Global-Value-Chain Decomposition
maintainer: Bastiaan Quast
description: |-
  Two global-value-chain decompositions are implemented. Firstly, the
  Wang-Wei-Zhu (Wang, Wei, and Zhu, 2013) algorithm splits bilateral gross exports
  into 16 value-added components. Secondly, the Leontief decomposition (default)
  derives the value added origin of exports by country and industry, which is also
  based on Wang, Wei, and Zhu (Wang, Z., S.-J. Wei, and K. Zhu. 2013. "Quantifying
  International Production Sharing at the Bilateral and Sector Levels.").
