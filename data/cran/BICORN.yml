title: Integrative Inference of De Novo Cis-Regulatory Modules
maintainer: Xi Chen
description: Prior transcription factor binding knowledge and target gene expression
  data are integrated in a Bayesian framework for functional cis-regulatory module
  inference. Using Gibbs sampling, we iteratively estimate transcription factor associations
  for each gene, regulation strength for each binding event and the hidden activity
  for each transcription factor.
