  A Fast Solver for Henderson Mixed Model Equation via Row
  Operations
maintainer: Jiwoong Kim
description: Consider the linear mixed model with normal random effects. A typical
  method to solve Henderson's Mixed Model Equations (HMME) is recursive estimation
  of the fixed effects and random effects. We provide a fast, stable, and scalable
  solver to the HMME without computing matrix inverse. See Kim (2017) <arXiv:1710.09663>
  for more details.
