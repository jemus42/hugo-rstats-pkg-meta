title: Variance Stabilizing Transformations for Single Cell UMI Data
maintainer: Christoph Hafemeister
description: |-
  A normalization method for single-cell UMI count data using a
  variance stabilizing transformation. The transformation is based on a
  negative binomial regression model with regularized parameters. As part of the
  same regression framework, this package also provides functions for
  batch correction, and data correction. See Hafemeister and Satija 2019
  <doi:10.1101/576827> for more details.
