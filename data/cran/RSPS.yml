title: RNA-Seq Power Simulation
maintainer: Milan Bimali
description: Provides functions for estimating power or sample size for RNA-Seq studies.
  Empirical approach is used and the data is assumed to be count in nature. The underlying
  distribution of data is assumed to be Poisson or negative binomial. The package
  contains 6 function; 4 functions provide estimates of sample size or power for Poisson
  and Negative Binomial distribution; 2 functions provide plots of power for given
  sample size or sample size for given power.
