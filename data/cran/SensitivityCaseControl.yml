title: Sensitivity Analysis for Case-Control Studies
maintainer: Dylan Small
description: This package performs sensitivity analysis for case-control studies in
  which some cases may meet a more narrow definition of being a case compared to other
  cases which only meet a broad definition.  The sensitivity analyses are described
  in Small, Cheng, Halloran and Rosenbaum (2013, "Case Definition and Sensitivity
  Analysis", Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1457-1468).  The functions
  sens.analysis.mh and sens.analysis.aberrant.rank provide sensitivity analyses based
  on the Mantel-Haenszel test statistic and aberrant rank test statistic as described
  in Rosenbaum (1991, "Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Case Control Studies", Biometrics);
  see also Section 1 of Small et al.  The function adaptive.case.test provides adaptive
  inferences as described in Section 5 of Small et al.  The function adaptive.noether.brown
  provides a sensitivity analysis for a matched cohort study based on an adaptive
  test.  The other functions in the package are internal functions.
