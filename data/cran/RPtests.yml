  Goodness of Fit Tests for High-Dimensional Linear Regression
  Models
maintainer: Rajen Shah
description: |-
  Performs goodness of fits tests for both high and low-dimensional linear models.
  It can test for a variety of model misspecifications including nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity.
  In addition one can test the significance of potentially large groups of variables, and also
  produce p-values for the significance of individual variables in high-dimensional linear
  regression.
