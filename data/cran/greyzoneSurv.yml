title: Fit a Grey-Zone Model with Survival Data
maintainer: Pingping Qu
description: Allows one to classify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk
  groups for disease progression based on a continuous marker that is associated with
  progression-free survival. It uses a latent class model to link the marker and survival
  outcome and produces two cutoffs for the marker to divide patients into three groups.
