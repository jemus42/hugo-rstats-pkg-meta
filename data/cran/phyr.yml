title: Model Based Phylogenetic Analysis
maintainer: Daijiang Li
description: |-
  A collection of functions to do model-based phylogenetic analysis.
  It includes functions to calculate community phylogenetic diversity,
  to estimate correlations among functional traits while accounting for
  phylogenetic relationships, and to fit phylogenetic generalized linear
  mixed models. The Bayesian phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models
  are fitted with the 'INLA' package (<http://www.r-inla.org>).
