title: Weight of Evidence Based Segmentation of a Variable
maintainer: Kashish Soien
description: |-
  Segment a numeric variable based on a dichotomous dependent variable by using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach (Ref: Siddiqi, N. (2006) <doi:10.1002/9781119201731.biblio>).
  The underlying algorithm adopts a recursive approach to create segments that are diverse in respect of their WOE values and meet the demands of user-defined parameters. The algorithm also aims to maintain a monotonic trend in WOE values of consecutive segments. As such, it can be particularly helpful in improving robustness of linear and logistic regression models.
