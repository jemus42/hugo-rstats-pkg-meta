version: 0.4.1
title: Plugins for R Markdown Formats
maintainer: Johan Larsson
description: |-
  Formats for R Markdown that undo modifications by
  'pandoc' and 'rmarkdown' to original 'latex' templates, such as
  smaller margins, paragraph spacing, and compact titles. In addition,
  enhancements such as author blocks with affiliations and
  headers and footers are introduced. All of this functionality is built
  around plugins that modify the default 'pandoc' template without relying on
  custom templates.
