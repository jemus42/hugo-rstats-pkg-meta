title: Missing Value Imputation for Accelerometer Data
maintainer: Jung Ae Lee
description: Imputation for the missing count values in accelerometer data. The methodology
  includes both parametric and semi-parametric multiple imputations under the zero-inflated
  Poisson lognormal model. This package also provides multiple functions to pre-process
  the accelerometer data previous to the missing data imputation. These includes detecting
  wearing and non-wearing time, selecting valid days and subjects, and creating plots.
