title: (Kernel) Isotope Niche Estimation
maintainer: Shannon E Albeke
description: |-
  Applies methods used to estimate animal homerange, but
  instead of geospatial coordinates, we use isotopic coordinates. The estimation
  methods include: 1) 2-dimensional bivariate normal kernel utilization density
  estimator, 2) bivariate normal ellipse estimator, and 3) minimum convex polygon
  estimator, all applied to stable isotope data. Additionally, functions to
  determine niche area, polygon overlap between groups and levels (confidence
  contours) and plotting capabilities.
