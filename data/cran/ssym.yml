title: Fitting Semi-Parametric log-Symmetric Regression Models
maintainer: Luis Hernando Vanegas
description: Set of tools to fit a semi-parametric regression model suitable for analysis
  of data sets in which the response variable is continuous, strictly positive, asymmetric
  and possibly, censored. Under this setup, both the median and the skewness of the
  response variable distribution are explicitly modeled by using semi-parametric functions,
  whose non-parametric components may be approximated by natural cubic splines or
  P-splines. Supported distributions for the model error include log-normal, log-Student-t,
  log-power-exponential, log-hyperbolic, log-contaminated-normal, log-slash, Birnbaum-Saunders
  and Birnbaum-Saunders-t distributions.
