description: 'Computes 138 standard climate indices at monthly, seasonal and annual
  resolution. These indices were selected, based on their direct and significant impacts
  on target sectors, after a thorough review of the literature in the field of extreme
  weather events and natural hazards. Overall, the selected indices characterize different
  aspects of the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, and are derived
  from a broad set of climatic variables, including surface air temperature, precipitation,
  relative humidity, wind speed, cloudiness, solar radiation, and snow cover. The
  138 indices have been classified as follow: Temperature based indices (42), Precipitation
  based indices (22), Bioclimatic indices (21), Wind-based indices (5), Aridity/ continentality
  indices (10), Snow-based indices (13), Cloud/radiation based indices (6), Drought
  indices (8), Fire indices (5), Tourism indices (5).'
