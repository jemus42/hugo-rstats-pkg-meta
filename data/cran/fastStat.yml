title: Faster for Statistic Work
maintainer: Jing Zhang
description: |-
  When we do statistic work, we need to see the structure of the data.
  list.str() function will help you see the structure of the data quickly.
  list.plot() function can help you check every variable in your dataframe.
  table_one() function will make it easy to make a baseline table including
  difference tests. uv_linear(), uv_logit(), uv_cox(), uv_logrank() will give
  you a hand to do univariable regression analysis, while mv_linear(),
  mv_logit() and mv_cox() will carry out multivariable regression analysis.
