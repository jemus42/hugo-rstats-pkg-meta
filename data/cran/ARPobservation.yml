description: |-
  Tools for simulating data generated by direct observation
  recording. Behavior streams are simulated based on an alternating renewal
  process, given specified distributions of event durations and interim
  times. Different procedures for recording data can then be applied to the
  simulated behavior streams. Functions are provided for the following
  recording methods: continuous duration recording, event counting, momentary
  time sampling, partial interval recording, whole interval recording, and
  augmented interval recording.
