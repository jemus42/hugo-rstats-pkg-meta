title: Bayesian Exponential Smoothing Models with Trend Modifications
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: |-
  An implementation of a number of Global Trend models for time series forecasting
  that are Bayesian generalizations and extensions of some Exponential Smoothing models.
  The main differences/additions include 1) nonlinear global trend, 2) Student-t error
  distribution, and 3) a function for the error size, so heteroscedasticity. The methods
  are particularly useful for short time series. When tested on the well-known M3 dataset,
  they are able to outperform all classical time series algorithms. The models are fitted
  with MCMC using the 'rstan' package.
