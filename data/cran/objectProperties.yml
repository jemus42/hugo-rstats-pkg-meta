title: A factory of self-describing properties.
maintainer: Tengfei Yin
description: Supports the definition of sets of properties on objects. Observers can
  listen to changes on individual properties or the set as a whole. The properties
  are meant to be fully self-describing. In support of this, there is a framework
  for defining enumerated types, as well as other bounded types, as S4 classes.
