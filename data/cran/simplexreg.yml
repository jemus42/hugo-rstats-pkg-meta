  Regression Analysis of Proportional Data Using Simplex
  Distribution
maintainer: Peng Zhang
description: |-
  Simplex density, distribution, quantile functions as well as random variable
  generation of the simplex distribution are given. Regression analysis of proportional data
  using various kinds of simplex models is available. In addition, GEE method can be applied
  to longitudinal data to model the correlation. Residual analysis is also involved. Some
  subroutines are written in C with GNU Scientific Library (GSL) so as to facilitate the
  computation.
