description: |-
  An implementation of feature selection and ranking via simultaneous perturbation
  stochastic approximation (SPSA-FSR) based on works by V. Aksakalli and M. Malekipirbazari
  (2015) <arXiv:1508.07630> and Zeren D. Yenice and et al. (2018) <arXiv:1804.05589>.
  The SPSA-FSR algorithm searches for a locally optimal set of features that yield the best
  predictive performance using a specified error measure such as mean squared error (for
  regression problems) and accuracy rate (for classification problems). This package requires
  an object of class 'task' and an object of class 'Learner' from the 'mlr' package.
