title: Calculates the Leaf Area Index (LAD) and Other Related Functions
maintainer: Danilo Roberti Alves de Almeida
description: |-
  A set of functions for analyzing the structure
  of forests based on the leaf area density (LAD) and leaf area index (LAI) measures
  calculated from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), i.e., scanning lidar (Light Detection
  and Ranging) data. The methodology is discussed and described in
  Almeida et al. (2019) <doi:10.3390/rs11010092> and
  Stark et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01864.x>.
