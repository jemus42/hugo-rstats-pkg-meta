title: Dynamic Modeling in R
maintainer: Michael D. Hunter
description: |-
  Intensive longitudinal data have become increasingly prevalent in
  various scientific disciplines. Many such data sets are noisy, multivariate,
  and multi-subject in nature. The change functions may also be continuous, or
  continuous but interspersed with periods of discontinuities (i.e., showing
  regime switches). The package 'dynr' (Dynamic Modeling in R) is an R package
  that implements a set of computationally efficient algorithms for handling a
  broad class of linear and nonlinear discrete- and continuous-time models with
  regime-switching properties under the constraint of linear Gaussian measurement
  functions. The discrete-time models can generally take on the form of a state-
  space or difference equation model. The continuous-time models are generally
  expressed as a set of ordinary or stochastic differential equations. All
  estimation and computations are performed in C, but users are provided with the
  option to specify the model of interest via a set of simple and easy-to-learn
  model specification functions in R. Model fitting can be performed using single-
  subject time series data or multiple-subject longitudinal data.
