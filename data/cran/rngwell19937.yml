title: Random number generator WELL19937a with 53 or 32 bit output
maintainer: Petr Savicky
description: |-
  Long period linear random number generator WELL19937a by
  F. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer and M. Matsumoto. The initialization
  algorithm allows to seed the generator with a
  numeric vector of an arbitrary length and uses MRG32k5a by
  P. L'Ecuyer to achieve good quality of the initialization. The
  output function may be set to provide numbers from the interval
  (0,1) with 53 (the default) or 32 random bits. WELL19937a is of
  similar type as Mersenne Twister and has the same period.
  WELL19937a is slightly slower than Mersenne Twister, but has
  better equidistribution and "bit-mixing" properties and faster
  recovery from states with prevailing zeros than Mersenne
  Twister. All WELL generators with orders 512, 1024, 19937 and
  44497 can be found in randtoolbox package.
