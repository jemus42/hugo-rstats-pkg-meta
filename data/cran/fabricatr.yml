title: Imagine Your Data Before You Collect It
maintainer: Graeme Blair
description: |-
  Helps you imagine your data before you collect it. Hierarchical data structures
  and correlated data can be easily simulated, either from random number generators or
  by resampling from existing data sources. This package is faster with 'data.table' and
  'mvnfast' installed.
