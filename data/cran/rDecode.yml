title: Descent-Based Calibrated Optimal Direct Estimation
maintainer: Chi Seng Pun
description: Algorithms for solving a self-calibrated l1-regularized quadratic programming
  problem without parameter tuning. The algorithm, called DECODE, can handle high-dimensional
  data without cross-validation. It is found useful in high dimensional portfolio
  selection (see Pun (2018) <https://ssrn.com/abstract=3179569>) and large precision
  matrix estimation and sparse linear discriminant analysis (see Pun and Hadimaja
  (2019) <https://ssrn.com/abstract=3422590>).
