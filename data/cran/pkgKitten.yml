title: Create Simple Packages Which Do not Upset R Package Checks
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  Provides a function kitten() which creates cute little
  packages which pass R package checks. This sets it apart from
  package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect files
  behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners, kitten() offers
  an alternative.
