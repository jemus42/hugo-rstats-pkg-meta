title: Preprocessing Tools to Create Design Matrices
maintainer: Max Kuhn
description: |-
  An extensible framework to create and preprocess
  design matrices. Recipes consist of one or more data manipulation
  and analysis "steps". Statistical parameters for the steps can
  be estimated from an initial data set and then applied to
  other data sets. The resulting design matrices can then be used
  as inputs into statistical or machine learning models.
