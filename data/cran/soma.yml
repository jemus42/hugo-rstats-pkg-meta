  General-Purpose Optimisation With the Self-Organising Migrating
  Algorithm
maintainer: Jon Clayden
description: This package provides an R implementation of the Self-Organising Migrating
  Algorithm, a general-purpose, stochastic optimisation algorithm. The approach is
  similar to that of genetic algorithms, although it is based on the idea of a series
  of ``migrations'' by a fixed set of individuals, rather than the development of
  successive generations. It can be applied to any cost-minimisation problem with
  a bounded parameter space, and is robust to local minima.
