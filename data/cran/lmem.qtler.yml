  Linear Mixed Effects Models for QTL Mapping for Multienvironment
  and Multitrait Analysis
maintainer: Gaston Quero
description: |-
  Performs QTL mapping analysis for balanced and for
  multi-environment and multi-trait analysis using mixed models.
  Balanced population, single trait, single environment QTL mapping is
  performed through marker-regression (Haley and Knott (1992) <DOI:10.1038/hdy.1992.131>,
  Martinez and Curnow (1992) <DOI:10.1007/BF00222330>,
  while multi-environment and multi-trait QTL
  mapping is performed through linear mixed models.
  These functions could use any of the following populations: double haploid,
  F2, recombinant inbred lines, back-cross, and 4-way crosses.
  Performs a Single Marker Analysis, a Single Interval Mapping,
  or a Composite Interval Mapping analysis, and then constructs a final model
  with all of the relevant QTL.
