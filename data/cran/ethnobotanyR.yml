title: Calculate Quantitative Ethnobotany Indices
maintainer: Cory Whitney
description: 'An implementation of the quantitative ethnobotany indices in R. The
  goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform for ethnobotanists to assess the cultural
  significance of plant species based on informant consensus. The package closely
  follows the paper by Tardio and Pardo-de-Santayana (2008). Tardio, J., and M. Pardo-de-Santayana,
  2008. Cultural Importance Indices: A Comparative Analysis Based on the Useful Wild
  Plants of Southern Cantabria (Northern Spain) 1. Economic Botany, 62(1), 24-39.
