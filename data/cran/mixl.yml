  for Large Datasets
maintainer: Joseph Molloy
description: |-
  Specification and estimation of multinomial logit
  models.  Large datasets and complex models are supported, with an
  intuitive syntax.  Multinomial Logit Models, Mixed models, random
  coefficients and Hybrid Choice are all supported.  For more
  information, see Molloy et al. (2019) <doi:10.3929/ethz-b-000334289>.
