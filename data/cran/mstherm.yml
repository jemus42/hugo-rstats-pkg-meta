title: Analyze MS/MS Protein Melting Data
maintainer: Jeremy Volkening
description: |-
  Software to aid in modeling and analyzing mass-spectrometry-based
  proteome melting data. Quantitative data is imported and normalized and
  thermal behavior is modeled at the protein level. Methods exist for
  normalization, modeling, visualization, and export of results. For a
  general introduction to MS-based thermal profiling, see Savitski et al.
