  Kernel Operations on the GPU, with Autodiff, without Memory
  Overflows
maintainer: Ghislain Durif
description: |-
  The 'KeOps' library lets you compute generic reductions of very large arrays
  whose entries are given by a mathematical formula. It combines a tiled reduction scheme
  with an automatic differentiation engine, and can be used through 'R', 'Matlab', 'NumPy' or
  'PyTorch' backends. It is perfectly suited to the computation of Kernel dot products
  and the associated gradients, even when the full kernel matrix does not fit into
  the GPU memory.
