title: Variational Bayes Discrete Mixture Model
maintainer: Benjamin Logsdon
description: |-
  Efficient algorithm for solving discrete mixture
  regression model for rare variant association analysis.
  Uses variational Bayes algorithm to efficiently search over
  model space.  Outputs an approximate likelihood ratio test
  as well as variant level posterior probabilities of
  association.
