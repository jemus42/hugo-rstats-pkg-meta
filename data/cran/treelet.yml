  An Adaptive Multi-Scale Basis for High-Dimensional, Sparse and
  Unordered Data
maintainer: Trent Gaugler
description: |-
  Treelets provides a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends
  wavelets to non-smooth signals. It returns a multi-scale orthonormal
  basis, where the final computed basis functions are supported
  on nested clusters in a hierarchical tree.  Both the tree and
  the basis, which are constructed simultaneously, reflect the
  internal structure of the data.
