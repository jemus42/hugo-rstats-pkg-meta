  Bayesian Neural Network for High-Dimensional Nonlinear Variable
  Selection
maintainer: Bochao Jia
description: Perform Bayesian variable selection for high-dimensional nonlinear systems
  and also can be used to test nonlinearity for a general regression problem. The
  computation can be accelerated using multiple CPUs. You can refer to <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1409122>
  for more detail.
