  Modeling, Imputing and Generating Synthetic Versions of Nested
  Categorical Data in the Presence of Impossible Combinations
maintainer: Olanrewaju Akande
description: This tool set provides a set of functions to fit the nested Dirichlet
  process mixture of products of multinomial distributions (NDPMPM) model for nested
  categorical household data in the presence of impossible combinations. It has direct
  applications in imputing missing values for and generating synthetic versions of
  nested household data.
