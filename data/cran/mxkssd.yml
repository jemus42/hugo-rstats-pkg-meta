title: Efficient mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs
maintainer: B N Mandal
description: |-
  mxkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced
  mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging
  the elements of the generator vector. The package tries to
  generate a supersaturated design that has EfNOD efficiency more
  than user specified efficiency level (mef). The package also
  displays the progress of generation of an efficient mixed-level
  k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100
  per cent means that one full round of interchange is completed.
  More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange
  may be required for larger designs.
