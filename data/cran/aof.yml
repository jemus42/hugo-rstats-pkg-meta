title: Ontogenetic Shifts in Central-Place Foraging Insects
maintainer: Fabrice Requier
description: |-
  A breakpoint-based method to detect ontogenetic shifts in
  univariate time-activity budget series of central-place foraging insects.
  The method finds a single breakpoint according to the likelihood function.
  The method was developed with honey bees in order to detect the Age at
  Onset of Foraging (AOF), but can be used for the detection of other
  ontogenetic shifts in other central-place foraging insects.
