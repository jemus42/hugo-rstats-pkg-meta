version: 0.1.0
title: Deal with Dependencies
maintainer: Vincent Guyader
description: |-
  Tools to help manage dependencies during package
  development.  This can retrieve all dependencies that are used in R
  files in the "R" directory, in Rmd files in "vignettes" directory and
  in 'roxygen2' documentation of functions. There is a function to
  update the Description file of your package and a function to create a
  file with the R commands to install all dependencies of your package.
  All functions to retrieve dependencies of R scripts and Rmd files can
  be used independently of a package development.
