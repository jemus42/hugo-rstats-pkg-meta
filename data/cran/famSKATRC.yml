  Family Sequence Kernel Association Test for Rare and Common

description: |-
  FamSKAT-RC is a family-based association kernel test for both
  rare and common variants. This test is general and several special cases
  are known as other methods: famSKAT, which only focuses on rare variants
  in family-based data, SKAT, which focuses on rare variants in
  population-based data (unrelated individuals), and SKAT-RC, which focuses
  on both rare and common variants in population-based data. When one
  applies famSKAT-RC and sets the value of phi to 1, famSKAT-RC becomes
  famSKAT. When one applies famSKAT-RC and set the value of phi to 1 and the
  kinship matrix to the identity matrix, famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT. When one
  applies famSKAT-RC and set the kinship matrix (fullkins) to the identity
  matrix (and phi is not equal to 1), famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT-RC. We also
  include a small sample synthetic pedigree to demonstrate the method with.
