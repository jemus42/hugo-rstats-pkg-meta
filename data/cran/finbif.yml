  Interface for the 'Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility'
  API
maintainer: William Morris
description: |-
  A programmatic interface to the 'Finnish Biodiversity Information
  Facility' ('FinBIF') API (<https://api.laji.fi>). 'FinBIF' aggregates
  Finnish biodiversity data from multiple sources in a single open access
  portal for researchers, citizen scientists, industry and government.
  'FinBIF' allows users of biodiversity information to find, access, combine
  and visualise data on Finnish plants, animals and microorganisms. The
  'finbif' package makes the publicly available data in 'FinBIF' easily
  accessible to programmers. Biodiversity information is available on taxonomy
  and taxon occurrence. Occurrence data can be filtered by taxon, time,
  location and other variables. The data accessed are conveniently
  preformatted for subsequent analyses.
