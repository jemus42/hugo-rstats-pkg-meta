title: Bayesian Modeling of Autoregressive Threshold Time Series Models
maintainer: Hanwen Zhang
description: 'Identification and estimation of the autoregressive threshold models
  with Gaussian noise, as well as positive-valued time series. The package provides
  the identification of the number of regimes, the thresholds and the autoregressive
  orders, as well as the estimation of remain parameters. The package implements the
  methodology from the 2005 paper: Modeling Bivariate Threshold Autoregressive Processes
  in the Presence of Missing Data <DOI:10.1081/STA-200054435>.'
