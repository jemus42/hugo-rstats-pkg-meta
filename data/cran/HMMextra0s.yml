title: Hidden Markov Models with Extra Zeros
maintainer: Ting Wang
description: Contains functions for hidden Markov models with observations having
  extra zeros as defined in the following two publications, Wang, T., Zhuang, J.,
  Obara, K. and Tsuruoka, H. (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12194>; Wang, T., Zhuang, J.,
  Buckby, J., Obara, K. and Tsuruoka, H. (2018) <doi:10.1029/2017JB015360>. The observed
  response variable is either univariate or bivariate Gaussian conditioning on presence
  of events, and extra zeros mean that the response variable takes on the value zero
  if nothing is happening. Hence the response is modelled as a mixture distribution
  of a Bernoulli variable and a continuous variable. That is, if the Bernoulli variable
  takes on the value 1, then the response variable is Gaussian, and if the Bernoulli
  variable takes on the value 0, then the response is zero too. This package includes
  functions for simulation, parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit, the Viterbi algorithm,
  and plotting the classified 2-D data. Some of the functions in the package are based
  on those of the R package 'HiddenMarkov' by David Harte.
