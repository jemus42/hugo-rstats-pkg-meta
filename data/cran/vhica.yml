maintainer: Arnaud Le Rouzic
description: 'The "Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis" method
  is described in the following publication: "VHICA: a new method to discriminate
  between vertical and horizontal transposon transfer: application to the mariner
  family within Drosophila" by G. Wallau. et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1093/molbev/msv341>.
  The purpose of the method is to detect horizontal transfers of transposable elements,
  by contrasting the divergence of transposable element sequences with that of regular
  genes.'
