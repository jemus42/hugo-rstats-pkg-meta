title: Weighted Win Loss Statistics and their Variances
maintainer: Xiaodong Luo
description: |-
  Calculate the (weighted) win loss statistics including the win ratio, win difference and win product
  and their variances, with which the p-values are also calculated. The variance estimation is based on
  Luo et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12225> and Luo et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7284>. This package also calculates general win loss statistics with
  user-specified win loss function with variance estimation based on
  Bebu and Lachin (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032>.
  This version corrected an error when outputting confidence interval for win difference.
