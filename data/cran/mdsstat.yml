title: Statistical Trending for Medical Devices Surveillance
maintainer: Gary Chung
description: |-
  A collection of common statistical algorithms used in active
  surveillance of medical device events. Context includes post-market
  surveillance, pharmacovigilance, signal detection and trending, and
  regulatory reporting. Primary inputs are device-event time series. Outputs
  include trending results with the ability to run multiple algorithms at
  once. This package works well with the 'mds' package, but does not require
  it.
