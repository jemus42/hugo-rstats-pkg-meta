title: Automatic Variable Reduction Using Principal Component Analysis
maintainer: Navinkumar Nedunchezhian
description: PCA done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data correlation matrix, here
  it automatically determines the number of factors by eigenvalue greater than 1 and
  it gives the uncorrelated variables based on the rotated component scores, Such
  that in each principal component variable which has the high variance are selected.
  It will be useful for non-statisticians in selection of variables. For more information,
  see the <http://www.ijcem.org/papers032013/ijcem_032013_06.pdf> web page.
