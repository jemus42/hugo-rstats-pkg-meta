title: Fetch and plot financial stress index and component data.
maintainer: Matt Barry
description: |-
  Forms queries to submit to the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank web
  site's financial stress index data site.  Provides query functions for both
  the composite stress index and the components data. By default the download
  includes daily time series data starting September 25, 1991.  The functions
  return a class of either type easing or cfsi which contain a list of items
  related to the query and its graphical presentation.  The list includes the
  time series data as an xts object.  The package provides four lattice time
  series plots to render the time series data in a manner similar to the
  bank's own presentation.
