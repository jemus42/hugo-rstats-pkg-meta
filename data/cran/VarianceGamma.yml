maintainer: David Scott
description: |-
  Provides functions for the variance gamma
  distribution. Density, distribution and quantile functions.
  Functions for random number generation and fitting of the
  variance gamma to data. Also, functions for computing moments
  of the variance gamma distribution of any order about any
  location. In addition, there are functions for checking the
  validity of parameters and to interchange different sets of
  parameterizations for the variance gamma distribution.
