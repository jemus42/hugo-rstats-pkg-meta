title: Special models for categorical variables
maintainer: John Hendrickx
description: '`ctab'' creates (multiway) percentage tables. `sqtab''<U+000a>contains
  a set of functions for estimating models for square<U+000a>tables such as quasi-independence,
  symmetry, uniform<U+000a>association. Examples show how to use these models in a<U+000a>loglinear
  model using glm or in a multinomial logistic model<U+000a>using mlogit or clogit'
