description: |-
  A collection of functions for interpretation and presentation
  of regression analysis.  These functions are used
  to produce the statistics lectures in
  <http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides>. Includes regression
  diagnostics, regression tables, and plots of interactions and
  "moderator" variables. The emphasis is on "mean-centered" and
  "residual-centered" predictors. The vignette 'rockchalk' offers a
  fairly comprehensive overview.  The vignette 'Rstyle' has advice
  about coding in R.  The package title 'rockchalk' refers to our
  school motto, 'Rock Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.'.
