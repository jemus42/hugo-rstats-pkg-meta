title: Bioinformatics Analysis of T-Cell and B-Cell Immune Repertoires
maintainer: Vadim I. Nazarov
description: |-
  A comprehensive framework for bioinformatics analysis of bulk and single-cell
  T-cell receptor and antibody repertoires. It provides seamless data loading, analysis and
  visualisation for AIRR (Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire) data, both bulk immunosequencing (RepSeq)
  and single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq). It implements most of the widely used AIRR analysis methods,
  such as: clonality analysis, estimation of repertoire similarities in distribution of clonotypes
  and gene segments, repertoire diversity analysis, annotation of clonotypes using external immune receptor
  databases and clonotype tracking in vaccination and cancer studies. A successor to our
  previously published 'tcR' immunoinformatics package (Nazarov 2015) <doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0613-1>.
