  Power Calculations for Cluster-Randomized and Cluster-Randomized
  Crossover Trials
maintainer: Ken Kleinman
description: Calculate power for cluster randomized trials (CRTs) that compare two
  means, two proportions, or two counts using closed-form solutions. In addition,
  calculate power for cluster randomized  crossover trials using Monte Carlo methods.
