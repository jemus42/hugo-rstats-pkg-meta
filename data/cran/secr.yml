title: Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture
maintainer: Murray Efford
description: Functions to estimate the density and size of a spatially distributed
  animal population sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as traps, or
  by searching polygons or transects. Models incorporating distance-dependent detection
  are fitted by maximizing the likelihood. Tools are included for data manipulation
  and model selection.
