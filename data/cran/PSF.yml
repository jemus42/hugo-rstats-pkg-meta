  Forecasting of Univariate Time Series Using the Pattern
  Sequence-Based Forecasting (PSF) Algorithm
maintainer: Neeraj Bokde
description: |-
  Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes univariate
  time series data as input and assist to forecast its future values.
  This algorithm forecasts the behavior of time series
  based on similarity of pattern sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the
  labeling of samples from database. The labels associated with samples are then
  used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series data. The further
  technical details and references regarding PSF are discussed in Vignette.
