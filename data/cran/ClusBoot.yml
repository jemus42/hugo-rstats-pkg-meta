title: Bootstrap Clustering
maintainer: Sugnet Lubbe
description: |-
  Clustering algorithms are designed to cluster objects into a number of clusters. Any clustering algorithm provides the 'best'
  grouping of objects according to some criterion.
  This does not guarantee a 'good' clustering solution in the sense that some allocations were not simply the result of chance.
  This package allows the user to apply any clustering algorithm to a data set. The cluster allocations are subjected to a
  bootstrap analysis
  to determine the extent to which the clustering structure is stable and fundamental to the data set. For more information
