  Frequency Matrix Approach for Assessing Very Low Frequency
  Variants in Sequence Records
maintainer: Taryn B. T. Athey
description: Using frequency matrices, very low frequency variants (VLFs) are assessed
  for amino acid and nucleotide sequences.  The VLFs are then compared to see if they
  occur in only one member of a species, singleton VLFs, or if they occur in multiple
  members of a species, shared VLFs.  The amino acid and nucleotide VLFs are then
  compared to see if they are concordant with one another.  Amino acid VLFs are also
  assessed to determine if they lead to a change in amino acid residue type, and potential
  changes to protein structures.
