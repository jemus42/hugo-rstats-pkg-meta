title: Methods for Transition Probabilities
maintainer: Gustavo Soutinho
description: |-
  Provides a function for estimating the transition probabilities in an illness-death model.
  The transition probabilities can be estimated from the unsmoothed landmark estimators developed
  by de Una-Alvarez and Meira-Machado (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12288>.
  Presmoothed estimates can also be obtained through the use of a parametric family of binary
  regression curves, such as logit, probit or cauchit. The additive logistic regression model
  and nonparametric regression are also alternatives which have been implemented.
  The idea behind the presmoothed landmark estimators is to use the presmoothing techniques
  developed by  Cao et al. (2005) <doi:10.1007/s00180-007-0076-6> in the
  landmark estimation of the transition probabilities.
