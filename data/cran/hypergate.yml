  Machine Learning of Hyperrectangular Gating Strategies for
  High-Dimensional Cytometry
maintainer: Etienne Becht
description: Given a high-dimensional dataset that typically represents a cytometry
  dataset, and a subset of the datapoints, this algorithm outputs an hyperrectangle
  so that datapoints within the hyperrectangle best correspond to the specified subset.
  In essence, this allows the conversion of clustering algorithms' outputs to gating
  strategies outputs.
