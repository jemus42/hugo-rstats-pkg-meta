title: Cluster Analysis via Nonparametric Density Estimation
maintainer: Giovanna Menardi
description: |-
  Cluster analysis via nonparametric density
  estimation is performed. Operationally, the kernel method is used throughout to estimate
  the density. Diagnostics methods for evaluating the quality of the clustering
  are available. The package includes also a routine to estimate the
  probability density function obtained by the kernel method, given a set of
  data with arbitrary dimensions.
