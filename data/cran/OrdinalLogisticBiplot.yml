description: |-
  Analysis of a matrix of polytomous items using Ordinal Logistic Biplots (OLB)
  The OLB procedure extends the binary logistic biplot to ordinal (polytomous) data.
  The  individuals are represented as points on a plane and the variables are represented
  as lines rather than vectors as in a classical or binary biplot, specifying the points
  for each of the categories of the variable.
  The set of prediction regions is established by stripes perpendicular to the line
  between the category points, in such a way that the prediction for each individual is given
  by its projection into the line of the variable.
