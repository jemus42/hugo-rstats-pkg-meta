title: Model Selection for Index of Asymmetry Distribution
maintainer: Satoshi Takahashi
description: Calculate AIC's and AICc's of unimodal model (one normal distribution)
  and bimodal model(a mixture of two normal distributions) which fit the distribution
  of indices of asymmetry (IAS), and plot their density, to help determine IAS distribution
  is unimodal or bimodal.
