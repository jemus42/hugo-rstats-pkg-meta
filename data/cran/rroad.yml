  Computation of the International Roughness Index (IRI) given a
  longitudinal road profile. The IRI can be calculated for a single road segment
  or for a sequence of segments with a fixed length (e. g. 100m). For the latter,
  an overlap of the segments can be selected. The IRI and likewise the algorithms
  for its determination are defined in Sayers, Michael W; Gillespie, Thomas D;
  Queiroz, Cesar A.V. 1986. The International Road Roughness Experiment (IRRE) :
  establishing correlation and a calibration standard for measurements. World
  Bank technical paper; no. WTP 45. Washington, DC : The World Bank. (ISBN
