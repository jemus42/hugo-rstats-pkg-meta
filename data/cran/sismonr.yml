title: Simulation of in Silico Multi-Omic Networks
maintainer: Olivia Angelin-Bonnet
description: 'A tool for the simulation of gene expression profiles for in silico
  regulatory networks. The package generates gene regulatory networks, which include
  protein-coding and noncoding genes linked via different types of regulation: regulation
  of transcription, translation, RNA or protein decay, and post-translational modifications.
  The effect of genetic mutations on the system behaviour is accounted for via the
  simulation of genetically different in silico individuals. The ploidy of the system
  is not restricted to the usual haploid or diploid situations, but is defined by
  the user. A choice of stochastic simulation algorithms allow us to simulate the
  expression profiles (RNA and if applicable protein abundance) of the genes in the
  in silico system for the different in silico individuals. A tutorial explaining
  how to use the package is available at <https://oliviaab.github.io/sismonr/>. Manuscript
  in preparation; see also Angelin-Bonnet O., Biggs P.J. and Vignes M. (2018) <doi:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621131>.
  Note that sismonr relies on Julia code called internally by the functions. No knowledge
  of Julia is required in order to use sismonr, but Julia must be installed on the
  computer (instructions can be found in the tutorial, the GitHub page or the vignette
  of the package).'
