title: Utilities for Working with R's Operators
maintainer: Christopher Brown
description: |-
  Provides a collection of utilities that allow programming with
  R's operators. Routines allow classifying operators,
  translating to and from an operator and its underlying function, and inverting
  some operators (e.g. comparison operators), etc. All methods can be extended
  to custom infix operators.
