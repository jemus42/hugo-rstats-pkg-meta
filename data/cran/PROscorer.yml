  Functions to Score Commonly-Used Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO)
  Measures and Other Psychometric Instruments
maintainer: Ray Baser
description: |-
  An extensible repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to score
  commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QOL), and
  other psychometric and psychological measures.  'PROscorer', together with
  the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system to facilitate the incorporation of
  PRO measures into research studies and clinical settings in a scientifically
  rigorous and reproducible manner.  These packages and their vignettes are
  intended to help establish and promote "best practices" to improve the
  planning, scoring, and reporting of PRO-like measures in research.
  The 'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions of
  each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete with references.  These
  instrument descriptions are suitable for inclusion in formal study protocol
  documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method sections.  Each
  'PROscorer' function is composed of helper functions from the
  'PROscorerTools' package, and users are encouraged to contribute new
  functions to 'PROscorer'.  More scoring functions are currently in
  development and will be added in future updates.
