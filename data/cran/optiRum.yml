  This fills the gaps credit analysts and loan modellers at
  Optimum Credit identify in the existing R code body.
  It allows for the production of documentation with less coding,
  replicates a number of Microsoft Excel functions useful for
  modelling loans (without rounding), and other helpful functions
  for producing charts and tables.  It also has some additional scales for
  use, including a GBP scale.
