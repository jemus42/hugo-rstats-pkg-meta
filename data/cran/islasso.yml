title: The Induced Smoothed Lasso
maintainer: Gianluca Sottile
description: 'An implementation of the induced smoothing (IS) idea to lasso regularization
  models to allow estimation and inference on the model coefficients (currently hypothesis
  testing only). Linear, logistic, Poisson and gamma regressions with several link
  functions are implemented. The algorithm is described in the original paper: Cilluffo,
  G., Sottile, G., La Grutta, S. and Muggeo, V. (2019) The Induced Smoothed lasso:
  A practical framework for hypothesis testing in high dimensional regression. <doi:10.1177/0962280219842890>,
  and discussed in a tutorial: Sottile, G., Cilluffo, G., and Muggeo, V. (2019) The
  R package islasso: estimation and hypothesis testing in lasso regression. <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.16360.11521>.'
