  Survival Data
maintainer: Kassu Mehari Beyene
description: |-
  Contains functions to estimate a smoothed and a non-smoothed (empirical)
  time-dependent ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) and
  the corresponding area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the optimal cutoff
  point for the right and interval censored survival data, as described in
  Beyene and El Ghouch (2019)<https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:219643>.
