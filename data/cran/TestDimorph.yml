  Analysis Of The Interpopulation Difference In Degree of Sexual
  Dimorphism Using Summary Statistics
maintainer: Bassam A. Abulnoor
description: Provides two approaches of comparison; the univariate and the multivariate
  analysis in two or more populations. Since the main obstacle of performing systematic
  comparisons in anthropological studies is the absence of raw data, the current package
  offer a solution for this problem by allowing the use of published summary statistics
  of metric data (mean, standard deviation and sex specific sample size) as illustrated
  by the works of  Greene, D. L. (1989) <doi:10.1002/ajpa.1330790113> and Konigsberg,
  L. W. (1991) <doi:10.1002/ajpa.1330840110>.
