  Nonparametric kernel estimation of the distribution function.
  Bandwidth selection and estimation of related functions.
maintainer: Alejandro Quintela del Rio
description: |-
  Nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation is
  performed. Three automatic bandwidth selection methods for
  nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation are
  implemented: the plug-in of Altman and Leger, the plug-in of
  Polansky and Baker, and the modified cross-validation of
  Bowman, Hall and Prvan. The exceedance function, the mean
  return period and the return level are also computed.
