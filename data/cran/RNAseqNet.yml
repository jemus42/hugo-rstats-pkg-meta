  Imputation

description: |-
  Infer log-linear Poisson Graphical Model with an auxiliary data
  set. Hot-deck multiple imputation method is used to improve the reliability
  of the inference with an auxiliary dataset. Standard log-linear Poisson
  graphical model can also be used for the inference and the Stability
  Approach for Regularization Selection (StARS) is implemented to drive the
  selection of the regularization parameter. The method is fully described in
  <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx819>.
