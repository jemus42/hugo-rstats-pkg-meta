  Prepare MCMCtree Analyses and Plot Bayesian Divergence Time
  Analyses Estimates on Trees
maintainer: Mark Puttick
description: Provides functions to prepare time priors for 'MCMCtree' analyses in
  the 'PAML' software from Yang (2007)<doi:10.1093/molbev/msm088> and plot time-scaled
  phylogenies from any Bayesian divergence time analysis. Most time-calibrated node
  prior distributions require user-specified parameters. The package provides functions
  to refine these parameters, so that the resulting prior distributions accurately
  reflect confidence in known, usually fossil, time information. These functions also
  enable users to visualise distributions and write 'MCMCtree' ready input files.
  Additionally, the package supplies flexible functions to visualise age uncertainty
  on a plotted tree with using node bars, using branch widths proportional to the
  age uncertainty, or by plotting the full posterior distributions on nodes. Time-scaled
  phylogenetic plots can be visualised with absolute and geological timescales . All
  plotting functions are applicable with output from any Bayesian software, not just
  'MCMCtree'.
