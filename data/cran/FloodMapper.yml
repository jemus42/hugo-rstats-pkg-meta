title: Cross-Scale Flooding Prediction under Heavy Precipitation
maintainer: Xander Wang
description: 'A gridded model to facilitate cross-scale flooding prediction under
  heavy precipitation events. The model also allows the consideration of current urban
  stormwater systems and their future developments in order to help explore potential
  adaptation strategies against climate change. Reference: Wang, X., G. Huang, and
  J. Liu (2014) <doi:10.1002/2014JD022564>.'
