title: Variables Selection for Clustering and Classification
maintainer: Stefano Benati
description: For a given data matrix A and cluster centers/prototypes collected in
  the matrix P, the functions described here select a subset of statistic variables
  Q that mostly explains/justifies P as prototypes. The functions are useful to reduce
  the data dimension for classification and to discard masking variables for clustering.
