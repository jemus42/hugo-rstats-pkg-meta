title: Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen Isotope Analysis
maintainer: Takumi Tsutaya
description: |-
  This estimates precise weaning ages
  for a given skeletal population
  by analyzing the stable nitrogen isotope ratios of them.
  Bone collagen turnover rates estimated anew and
  the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
  were adopted in this package.
