title: Market Matching and Causal Impact Inference
maintainer: Larsen Kim
description: For a given test market find the best control markets using time series
  matching and analyze the impact of an intervention. The intervention could be be
  a marketing event or some other local business tactic that is being tested. The
  workflow implemented in the Market Matching package utilizes dynamic time warping
  (the 'dtw' package) to do the matching and the 'CausalImpact' package to analyze
  the causal impact. In fact, this package can be considered a "workflow wrapper"
  for those two packages.
