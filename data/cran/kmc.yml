  Kaplan-Meier Estimator with Constraints for Right Censored Data
  -- a Recursive Computational Algorithm
maintainer: Yifan Yang
description: 'Given constraints for right censored data, we use a recursive computational
  algorithm to calculate the the "constrained" Kaplan-Meier estimator. The constraint
  is assumed given in linear estimating equations or mean functions. We also illustrate
  how this leads to the empirical likelihood ratio test with right censored data and
  accelerated failure time model with given coefficients. EM algorithm from emplik
  package is used to get the initial value. The properties and performance of the
  EM algorithm is discussed in Mai Zhou and Yifan Yang (2015)<doi: 10.1007/s00180-015-0567-9>
  and Mai Zhou and Yifan Yang (2017) <10.1002/wics.1400>. More applications could
  be found in Mai Zhou (2015) <doi: 10.1201/b18598>.'
