title: Efficient Approximate Bayesian Computation Sampling Schemes
maintainer: Nicolas Dumoulin
description: Enables launching a series of simulations of a computer code from the
  R session, and to retrieve the simulation outputs in an appropriate format for post-processing
  treatments. Five sequential sampling schemes and three coupled-to-MCMC schemes are
  implemented.
