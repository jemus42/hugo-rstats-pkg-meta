title: Loglikelihood Adjustment for Extreme Value Models
maintainer: Paul J. Northrop
description: |-
  Performs adjusted inferences based on model objects fitted, using
  maximum likelihood estimation, by the extreme value analysis packages
  'evd' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evd>,
  'evir' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evir>,
  'extRemes' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=extRemes>,
  'fExtremes' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=fExtremes>,
  'ismev' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ismev>,
  'mev' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=mev>,
  'POT' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=POT> and
  'texmex' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=texmex>.
  Adjusted standard errors and an adjusted loglikelihood are provided, using
  the 'chandwich' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich>
  and the object-oriented features of the 'sandwich' package
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=sandwich>. The adjustment is based on a
  robust sandwich estimator of the parameter covariance matrix, based on the
  methodology in Chandler and Bate (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>. This
  can be used for cluster correlated data when interest lies in the
  parameters of the marginal distributions, or for performing inferences that
  are robust to certain types of model misspecification.  Univariate extreme
  value models, including regression models, are supported.
