description: |-
  Utilities for spatial-temporal analysis and visualization of animal (e.g. cattle)
  tracking data. The core feature is a 'shiny' web application for customized processing
  of GPS logs, including features for data augmentation (e.g. elevation lookup), data selection,
  export, plotting, and statistical summaries. A data validation application allows for side-by-side
  comparison via time series plots and extreme value detection described by
  J.P. van Brakel <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22583391/peak-signal-detection-in-realtime-timeseries-data/>.
