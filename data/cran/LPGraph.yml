title: Nonparametric Smoothing of Laplacian Graph Spectra
maintainer: Kaijun Wang
description: |-
  A nonparametric method to approximate Laplacian graph spectra of a network with
  ordered vertices. This provides a computationally efficient algorithm for obtaining an
  accurate and smooth estimate of the graph Laplacian basis. The approximation results can
  then be used for tasks like change point detection, k-sample testing, and so on. The
  primary reference is Mukhopadhyay, S. and Wang, K. (2018, Technical Report).
