title: Bayesian bandwidth estimation and semi-metric selection for the<U+000a>functional
  kernel regression with unknown error density
maintainer: Han Lin Shang
description: Estimating optimal bandwidths for the regression mean function approximated
  by the functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator and the error density approximated by
  a kernel density of residuals simultaneously in a scalar-on-function regression.
  As a by-product of Markov chain Monte Carlo, the optimal choice of semi-metric is
  selected based on largest marginal likelihood.
