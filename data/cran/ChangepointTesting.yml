title: Change Point Estimation for Clustered Signals
maintainer: Shannon T. Holloway
description: A multiple testing procedure for clustered alternative hypotheses. It
  is assumed that the p-values under the null hypotheses follow U(0,1) and that the
  distributions of p-values from the alternative hypotheses are stochastically smaller
  than U(0,1). By aggregating information, this method is more sensitive to detecting
  signals of low magnitude than standard methods. Additionally, sporadic small p-values
  appearing within a null hypotheses sequence are avoided by averaging on the neighboring
  p-values.
