title: Determining Groups in Multiples Curves
maintainer: Nora M. Villanueva
description: |-
  A method for determining groups in multiple
  curves with an automatic selection of their number based on k-means or
  k-medians algorithms. The selection of the optimal number is provided by
  bootstrap methods. The methodology can be applied both in regression and survival framework.
  Implemented methods are:
  Grouping multiple survival curves described by Villanueva et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.8016>.
