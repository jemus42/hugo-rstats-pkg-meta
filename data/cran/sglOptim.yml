title: Generic Sparse Group Lasso Solver
maintainer: Niels Richard Hansen
description: |-
  Fast generic solver for sparse group lasso optimization
  problems. The loss (objective) function must be defined in a
  C++ module. The optimization problem is solved using a
  coordinate gradient descent algorithm. Convergence of the
  algorithm is established (see reference) and the algorithm is
  applicable to a broad class of loss functions. Use of parallel
  computing for cross validation and subsampling is supported
  through the 'foreach' and 'doParallel' packages. Development
  version is on GitHub, please report package issues on GitHub.
