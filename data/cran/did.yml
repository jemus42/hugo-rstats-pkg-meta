title: Treatment Effects with Multiple Periods and Groups
maintainer: Brantly Callaway
description: The standard Difference-in-Differences (DID) setup involves two periods
  and two groups -- a treated group and untreated group.  Many applications of DID
  methods involve more than two periods and have individuals that are treated at different
  points in time.  This package contains tools for computing average treatment effect
  parameters in Difference in Differences models with more than two periods and with
  variation in treatment timing using the methods developed in Callaway and Sant'Anna
  (2019) <https://ssrn.com/abstract=3148250>.  The main parameters are group-time
  average treatment effects which are the average treatment effect for a particular
  group at a a particular time.  These can be aggregated into a fewer number of treatment
  effect parameters, and the package deals with the cases where there is selective
  treatment timing, dynamic treatment effects, calendar time effects, or combinations
  of these.  There are also functions for testing the Difference in Differences assumption,
  and plotting group-time average treatment effects.
