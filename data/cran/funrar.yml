title: Functional Rarity Indices Computation
maintainer: Matthias Grenié
description: |-
  Computes functional rarity indices as proposed by Violle et al.
  (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.02.002>. Various indices can be computed
  using both regional and local information. Functional Rarity combines both
  the functional aspect of rarity as well as the extent aspect of rarity.
  'funrar' is presented in Grenié et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/ddi.12629>.
