title: Nested Resolvable Designs and their Associated Uniform Designs
maintainer: Mohamed Laib
description: |-
  Construction method of nested resolvable designs from
  a projective geometry defined on Galois field of order 2. The obtained
  Resolvable designs are used to build uniform design. The presented results
  are based on <https://eudml.org/doc/219563> and A. Boudraa et al. (See references).
