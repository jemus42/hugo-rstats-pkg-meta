maintainer: Yihui Xie
description: |-
  Functions to convert Rd to 'roxygen' documentation. It can parse an
  Rd file to a list, create the 'roxygen' documentation and update the original
  R script (e.g. the one containing the definition of the function)
  accordingly. This package also provides utilities that can help developers
  build packages using 'roxygen' more easily. The 'formatR' package can be used
  to reformat the R code in the examples sections so that the code will be
  more readable.
