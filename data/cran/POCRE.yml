title: Penalized Orthogonal-Components Regression
maintainer: Dabao Zhang
description: Penalized orthogonal-components regression (POCRE) is a supervised dimension
  reduction method for high-dimensional data. It sequentially constructs orthogonal
  components (with selected features) which are maximally correlated to the response
  residuals. POCRE can also construct common components for multiple responses and
  thus build up latent-variable models.
