  Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by ChronoModel or
  Oxcal
maintainer: Anne Philippe
description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis and the post-processing
  of the Markov Chains simulated by ChronoModel (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr> for
  more information).  ChronoModel is a friendly software to construct a chronological
  model in a Bayesian framework.  Its output is  a sampled Markov chain from the posterior
  distribution of dates component  the chronology. The functions can also be applied  to
  the  analyse of mcmc output generated by Oxcal software.
