title: Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood Estimate for Cohort Samplings
maintainer: Jie-Huei Wang
description: To compute the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimates (NPMLEs) and
  penalized NPMLEs with SCAD, HARD and LASSO penalties for nested case-control or
  case-cohort sampling design with time matching under Cox's regression model. It
  also proposes the standard error formula for estimator using observed profile likelihood.
  For details about (penalized) NPNLEs see the original paper "Penalized Full Likelihood
  Approach to Variable Selection for Cox's Regression Model under Nested Case-Control
  Sampling" by Wang et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09475-z>.
