title: Goodness-of-Fit Tests Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence
maintainer: Philippe Regnault
description: An implementation of Vasicek and Song goodness-of-fit tests. Several
  functions are provided to estimate differential Shannon entropy, i.e., estimate
  Shannon entropy of real random variables with density, and test the goodness-of-fit
  of some family of distributions, including uniform, Gaussian, log-normal, exponential,
  gamma, Weibull, Pareto, Fisher, Laplace and beta distributions; see Lequesne and
  Regnault (2018) <arXiv:1806.07244>.
