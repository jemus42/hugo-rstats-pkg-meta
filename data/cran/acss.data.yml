title: 'Data Only: Algorithmic Complexity of Short Strings (Computed via<U+000a>Coding
  Theorem Method)'
maintainer: Henrik Singmann
description: Data only package providing the algorithmic complexity of short strings,
  computed using the coding theorem method. For a given set of symbols in a string,
  all possible or a large number of random samples of Turing machines (TM) with a
  given number of states (e.g., 5) and number of symbols corresponding to the number
  of symbols in the strings were simulated until they reached a halting state or failed
  to end. This package contains data on 4.5 million strings from length 1 to 12 simulated
  on TMs with 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 symbols. The complexity of the string corresponds
  to the distribution of the halting states of the TMs.
