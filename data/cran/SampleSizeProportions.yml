  Calculating sample size requirements when estimating the
  difference between two binomial proportions
maintainer: Lawrence Joseph
description: |-
  A set of R functions for calculating sample size
  requirements using three different Bayesian criteria in the
  context of designing an experiment to estimate the difference
  between two binomial proportions. Functions for calculation of
  required sample sizes for the Average Length Criterion, the
  Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome Criterion in
  the context of binomial observations are provided. In all
  cases, estimation of the difference between two binomial
  proportions is considered. Functions for both the fully
  Bayesian and the mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are
  provided.
