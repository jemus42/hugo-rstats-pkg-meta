version: 0.3.0
title: Default Color Maps from 'matplotlib' (Lite Version)
maintainer: Simon Garnier
description: |-
  Implementation of the 'viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma',
  'inferno', and 'cividis' color maps for 'R'. 'viridis', 'magma', 'plasma',
  and 'inferno' are ported from 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/>, a
  popular plotting library for 'python'. 'cividis', was developed by Jamie R.
  Nu√±ez and Sean M. Colby. These color maps are designed in such a way that
  they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular
  form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to
  be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness (all
  color maps in this package) and color vision deficiency ('cividis' only).
  This is the 'lite' version of the more complete 'viridis' package that can
  be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
