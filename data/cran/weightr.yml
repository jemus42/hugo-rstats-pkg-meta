title: Estimating Weight-Function Models for Publication Bias
maintainer: Kathleen M. Coburn
description: |-
  Estimates the Vevea and Hedges (1995)
  weight-function model. By specifying arguments, users can
  also estimate the modified model described in Vevea and Woods (2005),
  which may be more practical with small datasets. Users
  can also specify moderators to estimate a linear model.
  The package functionality allows users to easily extract the
  results of these analyses as R objects for other uses. In addition,
  the package includes a function to launch both models as
  a Shiny application. Although the Shiny application is also available online,
  this function allows users to launch it locally if they choose.
