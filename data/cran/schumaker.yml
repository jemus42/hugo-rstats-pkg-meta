title: Schumaker Shape-Preserving Spline
maintainer: Stuart Baumann
description: |-
  This is a shape preserving spline <doi:10.1137/0720057>
  which is guaranteed to be monotonic and concave or convex if the
  data is monotonic and concave or convex. It does not use any
  optimisation and is therefore quick and smoothly converges to a
  fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function
  iteration. It also automatically gives the first two derivatives
  of the spline and options for determining behaviour when evaluated
  outside the interpolation domain.
