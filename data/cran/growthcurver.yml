title: Simple Metrics to Summarize Growth Curves
maintainer: Kathleen sprouffske
description: |-
  This is a simple package that fits the logistic equation to
  microbial growth curve data (e.g., repeated absorbance measurements
  taken from a plate reader over time). From this fit, a variety of
  metrics are provided, including the maximum growth rate,
  the doubling time, the carrying capacity, the area under the logistic
  curve, and the time to the inflection point.
