title: matrix powers
maintainer: Norm Matloff
description: |-
  A general framework for computing powers of matrices.  A
  key feature is the capability for users to write callback functions,
  called after each iteration, thus enabling customization for specific
  applications.  Diverse types of matrix classes/matrix multiplication
  are accommodated.  If the multiplication type computes in parallel,
  then the package computation is also parallel.
