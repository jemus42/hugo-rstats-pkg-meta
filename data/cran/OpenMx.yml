title: Extended Structural Equation Modelling
maintainer: Joshua N. Pritikin
description: |-
  Create structural equation models that can be manipulated programmatically.
  Models may be specified with matrices or paths (LISREL or RAM)
  Example models include confirmatory factor, multiple group, mixture
  distribution, categorical threshold, modern test theory, differential
  Fit functions include full information maximum likelihood, maximum likelihood, and weighted least squares.
  equations, state space, and many others.
  Support and advanced package binaries available at <http://openmx.ssri.psu.edu>.
  The software is described in Neale, Hunter, Pritikin, Zahery, Brick,
  Kirkpatrick, Estabrook, Bates, Maes, & Boker (2016) <doi:10.1007/s11336-014-9435-8>.
