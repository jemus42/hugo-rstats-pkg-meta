title: A Minimal Wrapper Around NIH's 'iCite' API
maintainer: Travis Riddle
description: |-
  A minimal wrapper around the NIH's 'iCite' API (<https://icite.od.nih.gov/api>).
  Given a vector of pubmed IDs, this package returns a dataframe of the information yielded by
  the 'iCite' API. The primary metrics yielded by 'iCite' are measurements of a paper's
  scientific influence and translational potential, but the API also returns other meta-data
  from the paper, including author names, publication journal, publication year, paper title,
  doi, and a number of other citation metrics.
