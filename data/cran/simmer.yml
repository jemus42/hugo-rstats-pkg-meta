title: Discrete-Event Simulation for R
maintainer: Iñaki Ucar
description: |-
  A process-oriented and trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation
  (DES) package for R. It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The
  architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written in 'C++' with
  automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a rich and flexible R API that
  revolves around the concept of trajectory, a common path in the simulation
  model for entities of the same type. Documentation about 'simmer' is provided
  by several vignettes included in this package, via the paper by Ucar, Smeets
  & Azcorra (2019, <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i02>), and the paper by Ucar,
  Hernández, Serrano & Azcorra (2018, <doi:10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700960>);
  see 'citation("simmer")' for details.
