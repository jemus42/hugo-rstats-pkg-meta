title: Distribution Pitting
maintainer: Harry Joo
description: 'Compares distributions with one another in terms of their fit to each
  sample in a dataset that contains multiple samples, as described in Joo, Aguinis,
  and Bradley (in press). Users can examine the fit of seven distributions per sample:
  pure power law, lognormal, exponential, power law with an exponential cutoff, normal,
  Poisson, and Weibull. Automation features allow the user to compare all distributions
  for all samples with a single command line, which creates a separate row containing
  results for each sample until the entire dataset has been analyzed.'
