title: Fast, Dependency-Free Geodesic Distance Calculations
maintainer: Mark Padgham
description: |-
  Dependency-free, ultra fast calculation of geodesic distances.
  Includes the reference nanometre-accuracy geodesic distances of Karney
  (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z>, as used by the 'sf' package, as well
  as Haversine and Vincenty distances. Default distance measure is the "Mapbox
  cheap ruler" which is generally more accurate than Haversine or Vincenty for
  distances out to a few hundred kilometres, and is considerably faster. The
  main function accepts one or two inputs in almost any generic rectangular
  form, and returns either matrices of pairwise distances, or vectors of
  sequential distances.
