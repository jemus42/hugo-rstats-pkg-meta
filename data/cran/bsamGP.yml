title: Bayesian Spectral Analysis Models using Gaussian Process Priors
maintainer: Beomjo Park
description: |-
  Contains functions to perform Bayesian inference
  using a spectral analysis of Gaussian process priors.
  Gaussian processes are represented with a Fourier series
  based on cosine basis functions. Currently the package
  includes parametric linear models, partial linear additive
  models with/without shape restrictions, generalized linear
  additive models with/without shape restrictions, and
  density estimation model. To maximize computational
  efficiency, the actual Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
  for each model is done using codes written in FORTRAN 90.
  This software has been developed using funding supported by
  Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
  Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education
  (no. NRF-2016R1D1A1B03932178 and no. NRF-2017R1D1A3B03035235).
