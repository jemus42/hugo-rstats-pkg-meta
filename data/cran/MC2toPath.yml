  Translates information from netcdf files with MC2 output into
  inter-PVT transitions.
maintainer: Dave Conklin
description: Post processes MC2 output, especially for use by Path or ST-Sim.  MC2
  (short for "MC1 version 2") is a dynamic global vegetation model (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGVM).  Path
  (essa.com/tools/path) and ST-Sim (www.apexrms.com) are state-and-transition model
  (STM) engines. MC2 has a user website at sites.google.com/site/mc1dgvmusers.  Since
  2001, MC1 has been used to simulate changes in natural vegetation due to climate
  change at scales from regional to global.  In 2012, MC1 was reimplemented in C++
  to make it faster and to reduce storage requirements.  This newer version is referred
  to as MC2, an abbreviation of "MC1 version 2".  Beginning in 2011, output from MC1
  and MC2 has been used to inform regional state-and-transition model simulations
  by the U.S. Forest Service and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.  Projects
  to date have involved study areas in central Oregon, the Olympic Peninsula, the
  Blue Mountains ecoregion, southwestern Oregon, and southeastern Oregon.  In the
  first of this series of projects, the netCDF output files from MC2 were manually
  post-processed, mostly in Excel, to produce input .csv files for the STM engines.
  Beginning with the second project, R scripts were used to automate the post-processing
  work.  These R scripts have been collected into the MC2toPath R-package.
