version: 0.7.4
title: Data and Methods Around Reference Values in Pediatrics
maintainer: Mandy Vogel
description: |-
  Calculation of standard deviation scores and percentiles adduced from different
  growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany, Italy, China, etc). Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values
  for different measures like BMI, weight, height, head circumference, different
  ratios, etc. are easy to carry out. Also, references for laboratory values in
  children and adults are available, e.g., serum lipids, iron-related blood parameters, IGF, liver enzymes. In the
  new version, there are also functions combining the lms() function from package 'gamlss' with
  resampling methods for using with repeated measurements and family dependencies. A searchable list
  of items can be found here: <https://github.com/mvogel78/childsds/wiki>.
