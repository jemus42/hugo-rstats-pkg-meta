version: 0.2.0
title: Access Elevation Data from Various APIs
maintainer: Jeffrey Hollister
description: |-
  Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
  data. This package provides access to several of those services and
  returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from
  point elevation services or as a raster object from raster
  elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to the
  Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles <https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/>
  and the USGS Elevation Point Query Service <http://ned.usgs.gov/epqs/>.
