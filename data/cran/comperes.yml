  Tools for storing and managing competition results.
  Competition is understood as a set of games in which players gain some
  abstract scores.  There are two ways for storing results: in long (one
  row per game-player) and wide (one row per game with fixed amount of
  players) formats. This package provides functions for creation and
  conversion between them. Also there are functions for computing their
  summary and Head-to-Head values for players. They leverage grammar of
  data manipulation from 'dplyr'.
