title: Hierarchical Regularized Regression
maintainer: Garrett Weaver
description: |-
  Fits hierarchical regularized regression models
  to incorporate potentially informative external data, Weaver and Lewinger (2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01761>.
  Utilizes coordinate descent to efficiently fit regularized regression models both with and without
  external information with the most common penalties used in practice (i.e. ridge, lasso, elastic net).
  Support for standard R matrices, sparse matrices and big.matrix objects.
