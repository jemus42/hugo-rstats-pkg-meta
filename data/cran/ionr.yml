title: Test for Indifference of Indicator
maintainer: Uku Vainik
description: |-
  Provides item exclusion procedure, which is a formal method to
  test 'Indifference Of iNdicator' (ION). When a latent personality
  trait-outcome association is assumed, then the association strength
  should not depend on which subset of indicators (i.e. items) has been
  chosen to reflect the trait. Personality traits are  often measured
  (reflected) by  a sum-score of a certain set of indicators.
  Item exclusion procedure randomly excludes items from a sum-score and
  tests, whether the sum-score - outcome correlation changes. ION has been
  achieved, when any item can be excluded from the sum-score without the
  sum-score - outcome correlation substantially changing . For more details,
  see Vainik, Mottus et. al, (2015) "Are Trait-Outcome Associations Caused
  by Scales or Particular Items? Example Analysis of Personality Facets and
  BMI",European Journal of Personality  DOI: <10.1002/per.2009> .
