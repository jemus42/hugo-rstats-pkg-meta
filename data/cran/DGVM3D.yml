version: 1.0.0
title: 3D Forest Simulation Visualization Tool
maintainer: Steinkamp Joerg
description: |-
  This is a visualization tool for vegetation structure/succession
  in space and/or time mainly for forest gap models. However, it could also be used to
  visualize observed forest stands. If used for models, they should contain either
  individual trees or cohorts (e.g. LPJ-GUESS by Smith et al. (2014) <doi:10.5194/bg-11-2027-2014>).
  For a list of required and additional data fields see the vignette.
