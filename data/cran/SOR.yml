title: Estimation using Sequential Offsetted Regression
maintainer: Lee McDaniel
description: Estimation for longitudinal data following outcome dependent sampling
  using the sequential offsetted regression technique.  Includes support for binary,
  count, and continuous data.  The first regression is a logistic regression, which
  uses a known ratio (the probability of being sampled given that the subject/observation
  was referred divided by the probability of being sampled given that the subject/observation
  was no referred) as an offset to estimate the probability of being referred given
  outcome and covariates.  The second regression uses this estimated probability to
  calculate the mean population response given covariates.
