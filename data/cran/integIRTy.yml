  Integrating Multiple Modalities of High Throughput Assays Using
  Item Response Theory
maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes
description: |-
  Provides a systematic framework for
  integrating multiple modalities of assays profiled on the same set of
  samples. The goal is to identify genes that are altered in cancer
  either marginally or consistently across different assays. The
  heterogeneity among different platforms and different samples are
  automatically adjusted so that the overall alteration magnitude can
  be accurately inferred. See Tong and Coombes (2012)
