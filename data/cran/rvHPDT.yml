  Calling haplotype-based and variant-based pedigree
  disequilibrium test for rare variants in pedigrees.
maintainer: Wei Guo
description: To detecting rare variants for binary traits using general pedigrees,
  the pedigree disequilibrium tests are proposed by collapsing rare haplotypes/variants
  with/without weights. To run the test, MERLIN is needed in Linux for haplotyping.
