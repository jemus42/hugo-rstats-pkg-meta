  Methods to Test Hypotheses on the Distribution of Spatial Point
  Processes
maintainer: Sarah Smith
description: Includes two functions to evaluate the hypothesis of complete spatial
  randomness (csr) in point processes.  The function 'mwin' calculates quadrat counts
  to estimate the intensity of a spatial point process through the moving window approach
  proposed by Bailey and Gatrell (1995).  Event counts are computed within a window
  of a set size over a fine lattice of points within the region of observation.  The
  function 'pielou' uses the nearest neighbor test statistic and asymptotic distribution
  proposed by Pielou (1959) to compare the observed point process to one generated
  under csr.  The value can be compared to that given by the more widely used test
  proposed by Clark and Evans (1954).
