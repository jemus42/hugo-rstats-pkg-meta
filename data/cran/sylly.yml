title: Hyphenation and Syllable Counting for Text Analysis
maintainer: Meik Michalke
description: |-
  Provides the hyphenation algorithm used for 'TeX'/'LaTeX'
  and similar software, as proposed by Liang (1983,
  <https://tug.org/docs/liang/>). Mainly contains the function
  hyphen() to be used for hyphenation/syllable counting of text
  objects. It was originally developed for and part of the
  'koRpus' package, but later released as a separate package so
  it's lighter to have this particular functionality available
  for other packages. Support for various languages needs be
  added on-the-fly or by plugin packages
  (<https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos>); this package does
  not include any language specific data. Due to some
  restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only
  available from the project homepage. To ask for help, report
  bugs, request features, or discuss the development of the
  package, please subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
  (<http://korpusml.reaktanz.de>).
