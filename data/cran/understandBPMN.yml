title: Calculator of Understandability Metrics for BPMN
maintainer: Gert Janssenswillen
description: 'Calculate several understandability metrics of BPMN models. BPMN stands
  for business process modelling notation and is a language for expressing business
  processes into business process diagrams. Examples of these understandability metrics
  are: average connector degree, maximum connector degree, sequentiality, cyclicity,
  diameter, depth, token split, control flow complexity, connector mismatch, connector
  heterogeneity, separability, structuredness and cross connectivity. See R documentation
  and paper on metric implementation included in this package for more information
  concerning the metrics.'
