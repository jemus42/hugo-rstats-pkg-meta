title: Association Football (Soccer) Ranking via Poisson Regression
maintainer: E Holmes
description: This package uses time dependent Poisson regression and a record of goals
  scored in matches to rank teams via estimated attack and defense strengths.  The
  statistical model is based on Dixon and Coles (1997) Modeling Association Football
  Scores and Inefficiencies in the Football Betting Market, Applied Statistics, Volume
  46, Issue 2, 265-280.  The package has a some webscrapers to assist in the development
  and updating of a match database.  If the match database contains unconnected clusters
  (i.e. sets of teams that have only played each other and not played teams from other
  sets), each cluster is ranked separately relative to the median team strength in
  the cluster.  The package contains functions for predicting and simulating tournaments
  and leagues from estimated models. The package allows fitting via the glm(), speedglm(),
  and glmnet() functions.  The latter allows fast and efficient fitting of very large
  numbers of teams.  The fitting algorithm will analyze the match data and determine
  which teams form a cluster (a set of teams where there is a path of matches connecting
  every team) and fit each cluster separately.
