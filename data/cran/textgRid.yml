title: Praat TextGrid Objects in R
maintainer: Patrick Reidy
description: |-
  The software application Praat can be used to annotate
  waveform data (e.g., to mark intervals of interest or to label events).
  (See <http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/> for more information about Praat.)
  These annotations are stored in a Praat TextGrid object, which consists of
  a number of interval tiers and point tiers. An interval tier consists of
  sequential (i.e., not overlapping) labeled intervals. A point tier consists
  of labeled events that have no duration. The 'textgRid' package provides
  S4 classes, generics, and methods for accessing information that is stored
  in Praat TextGrid objects.
