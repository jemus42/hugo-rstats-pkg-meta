  Time Series Analysis Toolkit Based on Symbolic Aggregate
  Discretization, i.e. SAX
maintainer: Pavel Senin
description: |-
  Implements time series z-normalization, SAX, HOT-SAX, VSM, SAX-VSM, RePair, and RRA
  algorithms facilitating time series motif (i.e., recurrent pattern), discord (i.e., anomaly),
  and characteristic pattern discovery along with interpretable time series classification.
