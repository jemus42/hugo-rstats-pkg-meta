title: Solvers for Large-Scale Eigenvalue and SVD Problems
maintainer: Yixuan Qiu
description: |-
  R interface to the 'Spectra' library
  <https://spectralib.org/> for large-scale eigenvalue and SVD
  problems. It is typically used to compute a few
  eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigenvalues,
  which is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n. This package
  provides the 'eigs()' function that does the similar job as in 'Matlab',
  'Octave', 'Python SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the 'svds()' function
  to calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
  singular vectors of a real matrix. The matrix to be computed on can be
  dense, sparse, or in the form of an operator defined by the user.
