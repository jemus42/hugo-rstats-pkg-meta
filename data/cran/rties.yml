title: Modeling Interpersonal Dynamics
maintainer: Emily Butler
description: |-
  The name of this package grew out of our research on temporal interpersonal
  emotion systems (TIES), hence 'rties'. It provides tools for using a set of models to
  investigate temporal processes in bivariate (e.g., dyadic) systems. The general approach
  is to model, one dyad at a time, the dynamics of a variable that is assessed repeatedly
  from both partners, extract the parameter estimates for each dyad, and then use those
  parameter estimates as input to a latent profile analysis to extract groups of dyads with
  qualitatively distinct dynamics. Finally, the profile memberships can be used to either
  predict, or be predicted by, another variable of interest. Currently, 2 models are supported:
  1) inertia-coordination, and 2) a coupled-oscillator. Extended documentation is provided
  in vignettes. Theoretical background can be found in Butler (2011) <doi:10.1177/1088868311411164>
  and Butler & Barnard (2019) <doi:10.1097/PSY.0000000000000703>.
