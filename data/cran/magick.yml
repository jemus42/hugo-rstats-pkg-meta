version: '2.3'
title: Advanced Graphics and Image-Processing in R
maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Bindings to 'ImageMagick': the most comprehensive open-source image
  processing library available. Supports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff,
  pdf, etc) and manipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc).
  All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either
  on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers, collages,
  or animation. In RStudio images are automatically previewed when printed to
  the console, resulting in an interactive editing environment. The latest
  version of the package includes a native graphics device for creating
  in-memory graphics or drawing onto images using pixel coordinates.
