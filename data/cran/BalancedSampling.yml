title: Balanced and Spatially Balanced Sampling
maintainer: Anton Grafstr√∂m
description: Select balanced and spatially balanced probability samples in multi-dimensional
  spaces with any prescribed inclusion probabilities. It contains fast (C++ via Rcpp)
  implementations of the included sampling methods. The local pivotal method and spatially
  correlated Poisson sampling (for spatially balanced sampling) are included. Also
  the cube method (for balanced sampling) and the local cube method (for doubly balanced
  sampling) are included.
