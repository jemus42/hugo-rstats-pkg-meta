title: Multivariate Nonparametric Methods
maintainer: John E. Kolassa
description: A collection of multivariate nonparametric methods, selected in part
  to support an MS level course in nonparametric statistical methods. Methods include
  adjustments for multiple comparisons, implementation of multivariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
  testing, inversion of these tests to produce a confidence region, some permutation
  tests for linear models, and some algorithms for calculating exact probabilities
  associated with one- and two- stage testing involving Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics.
