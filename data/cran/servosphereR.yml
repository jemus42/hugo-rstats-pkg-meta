title: Analyze Data Generated from Syntech Servosphere Trials
maintainer: Jacob T. Wittman
description: |-
  Functions that facilitate and speed up the analysis of data
  produced by a Syntech servosphere <http://www.ockenfels-syntech.com/products/locomotion-compensation/>,
  which is equipment for studying the movement behavior of arthropods.
  This package is designed to make working with data produced from a
  servosphere easy for someone new to or unfamiliar with R. The functions
  provided in this package fall into three broad-use categories: functions for
  cleaning raw data produced by the servosphere software, functions for
  deriving movement variables based on position data, and functions for
  summarizing movement variables for easier analysis. These functions are
  built with functions from the tidyverse package to work efficiently, as a
  single servosphere file may consist of hundreds of thousands of rows of data
  and a user may wish to analyze hundreds of files at a time. Many of the
  movement variables derivable through this package are described in the
  following papers:
