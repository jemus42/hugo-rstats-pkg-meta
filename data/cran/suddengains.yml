maintainer: Milan Wiedemann
description: Identify sudden gains based on the three criteria outlined by Tang and
  DeRubeis (1999) <doi:10.1037/0022-006X.67.6.894> to a selection of repeated measures.
  Sudden losses, defined as the opposite of sudden gains can also be identified. Two
  different datasets can be created, one including all sudden gains/losses and one
  including one selected sudden gain/loss for each case. It can extract scores around
  sudden gains/losses. It can plot the average change around sudden gains/losses and
  trajectories of individual cases.
