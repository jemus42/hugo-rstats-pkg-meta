title: Dixon's Ratio Test for Outlier Detection
maintainer: Thorsten Pohlert
description: |-
  For outlier detection in small and normally distributed
  samples the ratio test of Dixon (Q-test) can be used. Density,
  distribution function, quantile function and random generation
  for Dixon's ratio statistics are provided as wrapper functions.
  The core applies McBane's Fortran functions <doi:10.18637/jss.v016.i03>
  that use Gaussian quadrature for a numerical solution.
