maintainer: Russell Lenth
description: |-
  Provides functions to generate response-surface designs,
  fit first- and second-order response-surface models,
  make surface plots, obtain the path of steepest ascent,
  and do canonical analysis. A good reference on these methods
  is Chapter 10 of Wu, C-F J and Hamada, M (2009)
  "Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Parameter Design Optimization"
