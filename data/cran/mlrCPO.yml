  Composable Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for Machine
  Learning
maintainer: Martin Binder
description: |-
  Toolset that enriches 'mlr' with a diverse set of preprocessing
  operators. Composable Preprocessing Operators ("CPO"s) are first-class
  R objects that can be applied to data.frames and 'mlr' "Task"s to modify
  data, can be attached to 'mlr' "Learner"s to add preprocessing to machine
  learning algorithms, and can be composed to form preprocessing pipelines.
