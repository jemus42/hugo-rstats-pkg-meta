  Compute least squares estimates of one bounded or two ordered
  isotonic regression curves
maintainer: Kaspar Rufibach
description: 'We consider the problem of estimating two isotonic regression curves
  g1* and g2* under the constraint that they are ordered, i.e. g1* <= g2*. Given two
  sets of n data points y_1, ..., y_n and z_1, ..., z_n that are observed at (the
  same) deterministic design points x_1, ..., x_n, the estimates are obtained by minimizing
  the Least Squares criterion L(a, b) = sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - a_i)^2 w1(x_i) + sum_{i=1}^n
  (z_i - b_i)^2 w2(x_i) over the class of pairs of vectors (a, b) such that a and
  b are isotonic and a_i <= b_i for all i = 1, ..., n. We offer two different approaches
  to compute the estimates: a projected subgradient algorithm where the projection
  is calculated using a PAVA as well as Dykstra''s cyclical projection algorithm.'
