maintainer: St√©phane Guerrier
description: 'A system contains easy-to-use tools as a support for time series analysis
  courses. In particular, it incorporates a technique called Generalized Method of
  Wavelet Moments (GMWM) as well as its robust implementation for fast and robust
  parameter estimation of time series models which is described, for example, in Guerrier
  et al. (2013) <doi: 10.1080/01621459.2013.799920>. More details can also be found
  in the paper linked to via the URL below.'
