title: Simple R Cache
maintainer: Augustin Luna
description: |-
  Simple result caching in R based on R.cache. The global environment is not
  considered when caching results simplifying moving files between multiple instances
  of R. Relies on more base functions than R.cache (e.g. cached results are saved using
  saveRDS() and readRDS()).
