version: 1.2.1
title: Retrieve and Analyze Clinical Trials in Public Registers
maintainer: Ralf Herold
description: |-
  Provides functions for querying, retrieving and analysing
  protocol- and results-related information on clinical trials from
  two public registers, the European Union Clinical Trials Register
  (EUCTR, <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>) and
  ClinicalTrials.gov (CTGOV, <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>). The
  information is transformed and then stored in a database (nodbi).
  Functions are provided for accessing and analysing the locally
  stored information on the clinical trials, as well as for
  identifying duplicate records. The package is motivated by the need
  for aggregating and trend-analysing the design, conduct and outcomes
  across clinical trials.
