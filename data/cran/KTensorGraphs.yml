title: Co-Tucker3 Analysis of Two Sequences of Matrices
maintainer: Miguel Rodriguez-Rosa
description: |-
  Provides a function called COTUCKER3() (Co-Inertia Analysis
  + Tucker3 method) which performs a Co-Tucker3 analysis of two sequences of
  matrices, as well as other functions called PCA() (Principal Component Analysis)
  and BGA() (Between-Groups Analysis), which perform analysis of one matrix,
  COIA() (Co-Inertia Analysis), which performs analysis of two matrices, PTA()
  (Partial Triadic Analysis) and TUCKER3(), which perform analysis of a sequence
  of matrices, and BGCOIA() (Between-Groups Co-Inertia Analysis), STATICO()
  (STATIS method + Co-Inertia Analysis), COSTATIS() (Co-Inertia Analysis + STATIS
  method), which also perform analysis of two sequences of matrices.
