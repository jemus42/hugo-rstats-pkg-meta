title: Survival Analysis in Health Economic Evaluation
maintainer: Gianluca Baio
description: Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.
  These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood)
  or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). The user can specify a set of parametric models using
  a common notation and select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also
  be post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used
  to export the output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by
  modellers and practitioners).
