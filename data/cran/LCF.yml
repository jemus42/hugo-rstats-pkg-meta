maintainer: Florian Werner
description: |-
  Baseline correction, normalization and linear combination fitting (LCF)
  of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra.
  The package includes data loading of .xmu files exported from 'ATHENA' (Ravel and Newville, 2005) <doi:10.1107/S0909049505012719>.
  Loaded spectra can be background corrected and all standards can be fitted at once.
  Two linear combination fitting functions can be used:
  (1) fit_athena(): Simply fitting combinations of standards as in ATHENA,
  (2) fit_float(): Fitting all standards with changing baseline correction and edge-step normalization parameters.
