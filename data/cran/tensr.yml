title: Covariance Inference and Decompositions for Tensor Datasets
maintainer: David Gerard
description: |-
  A collection of functions for Kronecker structured covariance
  estimation and testing under the array normal model. For estimation,
  maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant estimation procedures are
  implemented. For testing, a likelihood ratio testing procedure is
  available. This package also contains additional functions for manipulating
  and decomposing tensor data sets. This work was partially supported by NSF
  grant DMS-1505136. Details of the methods are described in
  Gerard and Hoff (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.01.020> and
  Gerard and Hoff (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.laa.2016.04.033>.
