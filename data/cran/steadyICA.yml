  ICA and Tests of Independence via Multivariate Distance
  Covariance
maintainer: Benjamin Risk
description: |-
  Functions related to multivariate measures of independence and ICA:
  -estimate independent components by minimizing distance covariance;
  -conduct a test of mutual independence based on distance covariance;
  -estimate independent components via infomax (a popular method but generally performs poorer than mdcovica, ProDenICA, and/or fastICA, but is useful for comparisons);
  -order indepedent components by skewness;
  -match independent components from multiple estimates;
  -other functions useful in ICA.
