title: Estimate Causal Effects with Borrowing Between Data Sources
maintainer: Jeffrey A. Boatman
description: |-
  Estimate population average treatment effects from a primary data source
  with borrowing from supplemental sources. Causal estimation is done with either a
  Bayesian linear model or with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to adjust
  for confounding. Borrowing is done with multisource exchangeability models (MEMs). For
  information on BART, see Chipman, George, & McCulloch (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285>.
  For information on MEMs, see Kaizer, Koopmeiners, &
  Hobbs (2018) <doi10.1093/biostatistics/kxx031>.
