title: RNA-Seq Generation/Modification for Simulation
maintainer: David Gerard
description: |-
  Generates/modifies RNA-seq data for use in simulations. We provide
  a suite of functions that will add a known amount of signal to a real
  RNA-seq dataset. The advantage of using this approach over simulating under
  a theoretical distribution is that common/annoying aspects of the data
  are more preserved, giving a more realistic evaluation of your method.
  The main functions are select_counts(), thin_diff(), thin_lib(),
  thin_gene(), thin_2group(), thin_all(), and effective_cor(). See
  Gerard (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12859-020-3450-9> for details on the
  implemented methods.
