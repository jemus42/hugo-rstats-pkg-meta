title: Client for 'Mapzen' and Related Map APIs
maintainer: Tarak Shah
description: |-
  Provides an interface to 'Mapzen'-based APIs (including
  geocode.earth, Nextzen, and NYC GeoSearch) for geographic search
  and geocoding, isochrone calculation, and vector data to draw map tiles.
  See <https://mapzen.com/documentation/> for more information. The original
  Mapzen has gone out of business, but 'rmapzen' can be set up to work with
  any provider who implements the Mapzen API.
