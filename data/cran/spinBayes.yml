  Semi-Parametric Gene-Environment Interaction via Bayesian
  Variable Selection
maintainer: Jie Ren
description: |-
  Many complex diseases are known to be affected by the interactions between
  genetic variants and environmental exposures beyond the main genetic and environmental
  effects. Existing Bayesian methods for gene-environment (G×E) interaction studies are
  challenged by the high-dimensional nature of the study and the complexity of environmental
  influences. We have developed a novel and powerful semi-parametric Bayesian variable
  selection method that can accommodate linear and nonlinear G×E interactions simultaneously
  (Ren et al. (2019) <arXiv:1906.01057>). Furthermore, the proposed method can conduct
  structural identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from main effects only
  case within Bayesian framework. Spike-and-slab priors are incorporated on both individual
  and group level to shrink coefficients corresponding to irrelevant main and interaction
  effects to zero exactly. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and
  alternative methods are  efficiently implemented in C++.
