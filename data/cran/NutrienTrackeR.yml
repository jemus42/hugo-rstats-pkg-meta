title: Food Composition Information and Dietary Assessment
maintainer: Rafael Ayala
description: 'Provides a tool set for food information and dietary assessment. It
  uses food composition data from several reference databases, including: ''USDA''
  (United States), ''CIQUAL'' (France), and ''BEDCA'' (Spain). ''NutrienTrackeR''
  calculates the intake levels for both macronutrient and micronutrients, and compares
  them with the recommended dietary allowances (RDA). It includes a number of visualization
  tools, such as time series plots of nutrient intake, and pie-charts showing the
  main foods contributing to the intake level of a given nutrient.'
