version: 1.0.3
title: R Simple Image Mosaic Creation Library
maintainer: Alberto Krone-Martins
description: Provides a way to transform an image into a mosaic composed from a set
  of smaller images (tiles). It also contains a simple function for creating the tiles
  from a folder of images directly through R, without the need of any external code.
  At this moment only the JPEG format is supported, either as input (image and tiles)
  or output (mosaic transformed image).
