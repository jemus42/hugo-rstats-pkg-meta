title: Create Waterfall Charts using 'ggplot2' Simply
maintainer: Hugh Parsonage
description: A not uncommon task for quants is to create 'waterfall charts'. There
  seems to be no simple way to do this in 'ggplot2' currently. This package contains
  a single function (waterfall) that simply draws a waterfall chart in a 'ggplot2'
  object. Some flexibility is provided, though often the object created will need
  to be modified through a theme.
