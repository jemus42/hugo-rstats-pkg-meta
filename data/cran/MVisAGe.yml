title: Compute and Visualize Bivariate Associations
maintainer: Vonn Walter
description: |-
  Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are commonly used to quantify the strength
  of bivariate associations of genomic variables.  For example, correlations of gene-level
  DNA copy number and gene expression measurements may be used to assess the impact of
  DNA copy number changes on gene expression in tumor tissue.  'MVisAGe' enables users to
  quickly compute and visualize the correlations in order to assess the effect of regional
  genomic events such as changes in DNA copy number or DNA methylation level.  Please see
