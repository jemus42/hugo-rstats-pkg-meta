title: Solve Delay Differential Equations
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Solves ordinary and delay differential equations, where
  the objective function is written in either R or C.  Suitable only
  for non-stiff equations, the solver uses a 'Dormand-Prince' method
  that allows interpolation of the solution at any point.  This
  approach is as described by Hairer, Norsett and Wanner (1993)
  <ISBN:3540604529>.  Support is also included for iterating
  difference equations.
