title: Benchmarking and Rescaling R2 using Noise Percentile Analysis
maintainer: Joseph G Kreke
description: Provides the tools needed to benchmark the R2 value corresponding to
  a certain acceptable noise level while also providing a rescaling function based
  on that noise level yielding a new value of R2 we refer to as R2k which is independent
  of both the number of degrees of freedom and the noise distribution function.
