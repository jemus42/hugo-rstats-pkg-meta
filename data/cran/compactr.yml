title: Creates empty plots with compact axis notation
maintainer: Carlisle Rainey
description: Creates empty plots with compact axis notation to which users can<U+000a>add
  whatever they like (points, lines, text, etc.) The notation is more<U+000a>compact
  in the sense that the axis-labels and tick-labels are closer to the<U+000a>axis
  and the tick-marks are shorter. Also, if the plot appears as part of a<U+000a>matrix,
  the x-axis notation is suppressed unless the plot appears along the<U+000a>bottom
  row and the y-axis notation is suppress unless the plot appears<U+000a>along the
  left column.
