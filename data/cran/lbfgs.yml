title: Limited-memory BFGS Optimization
maintainer: Antonio Coppola
description: A wrapper built around the libLBFGS optimization library by Naoaki Okazaki.
  The lbfgs package implements both the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
  (L-BFGS) and the Orthant-Wise Quasi-Newton Limited-Memory (OWL-QN) optimization
  algorithms. The L-BFGS algorithm solves the problem of minimizing an objective,
  given its gradient, by iteratively computing approximations of the inverse Hessian
  matrix. The OWL-QN algorithm finds the optimum of an objective plus the L1-norm
  of the problem's parameters. The package offers a fast and memory-efficient implementation
  of these optimization routines, which is particularly suited for high-dimensional
  problems.
