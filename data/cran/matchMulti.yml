title: Optimal Multilevel Matching using a Network Algorithm
maintainer: Sam Pimentel
description: Performs multilevel matches for data with cluster-level treatments and
  individual-level outcomes using a network optimization algorithm.  Functions for
  checking balance at the cluster and individual levels are also provided, as are
  methods for permutation-inference-based outcome analysis.  Details in Pimentel et
  al. (2017+), forthcoming in the Annals of Applied Statistics.
