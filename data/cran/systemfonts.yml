version: 0.2.2
title: System Native Font Finding
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  Provides system native access to the font catalogue. As font
  handling varies between systems it is difficult to correctly locate
  installed fonts across different operating systems. The 'systemfonts'
  package provides bindings to the native libraries on Windows, macOS and
  Linux for finding font files that can then be used further by e.g. graphic
  devices. The main use is intended to be from compiled code but 'systemfonts'
  also provides access from R.
