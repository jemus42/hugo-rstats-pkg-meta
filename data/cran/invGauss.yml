  Threshold regression that fits the (randomized drift) inverse
  Gaussian distribution to survival data.
maintainer: Hakon K. Gjessing
description: invGauss fits the (randomized drift) inverse Gaussian distribution to
  survival data. The model is described in Aalen OO, Borgan O, Gjessing HK. Survival
  and Event History Analysis. A Process Point of View. Springer, 2008. It is based
  on describing time to event as the barrier hitting time of a Wiener process, where
  drift towards the barrier has been randomized with a Gaussian distribution. The
  model allows covariates to influence starting values of the Wiener process and/or
  average drift towards a barrier, with a user-defined choice of link functions.
