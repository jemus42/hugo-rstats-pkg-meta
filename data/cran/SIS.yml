description: |-
  Variable selection techniques are essential tools for model
  selection and estimation in high-dimensional statistical models. Through this
  publicly available package, we provide a unified environment to carry out
  variable selection using iterative sure independence screening (SIS) (Fan and Lv (2008)<doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00674.x>) and all
  of its variants in generalized linear models (Fan and Song (2009)<doi:10.1214/10-AOS798>) and the Cox proportional hazards
  model (Fan, Feng and Wu (2010)<doi:10.1214/10-IMSCOLL606>).
