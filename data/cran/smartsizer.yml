title: Power Analysis for a SMART Design
maintainer: William Artman
description: |-
  A set of tools for determining the necessary sample size
  in order to identify the optimal dynamic treatment regime
  in a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART).
  Utilizes multiple comparisons with the best methodology
  to adjust for multiple comparisons.
  Designed for an arbitrary SMART design. Please see Artman (2018) <10.1093/biostatistics/kxy064> for more details.
  The basic functionality of this R package has been implemented in a Shiny app <https://wilart.shinyapps.io/smartsizer-power-sample-size/>.
