title: Estimation of Recombination Rate and Maternal LD in Half-Sibs
maintainer: DÃ¶rte Wittenburg
description: |-
  Paternal recombination rate and maternal linkage disequilibrium
  (LD) are estimated for pairs of biallelic markers such as single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) from progeny genotypes and sire haplotypes. At least
  one sire has to be double heterozygous at the investigated pairs of SNPs.
  The implementation relies on paternal half-sib families. If maternal half-
  sib families are used, the roles of sire/dam are swapped. Multiple families
  can be considered.
