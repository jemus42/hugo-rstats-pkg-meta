description: |-
  'BEAST2' (<https://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'Tracer' (<http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/>) is a GUI tool
  to parse and analyze the files generated by 'BEAST2'.
  This package provides a way to parse and analyze 'BEAST2' input
  files without active user input, but using
  R function calls instead.
