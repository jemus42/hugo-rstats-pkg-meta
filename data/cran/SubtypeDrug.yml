title: Prioritization of Candidate Cancer Subtype Specific Drugs
maintainer: Junwei Han
description: |-
  A systematic biology tool was developed to prioritize cancer subtype-specific drugs by integrating genetic perturbation, drug action, biological pathway, and cancer subtype.
  The capabilities of this tool include inferring patient-specific subpathway activity profiles in the context of gene expression profiles with subtype labels, calculating differentially
  expressed subpathways based on cultured human cells treated with drugs in the 'cMap' (connectivity map) database, prioritizing cancer subtype specific drugs according to drug-disease
  reverse association score based on subpathway, and visualization of results (Castelo (2013) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-7>; Han et al (2019) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz894>; Lamb and Justin (2006) <DOI:10.1126/science.1132939>).
