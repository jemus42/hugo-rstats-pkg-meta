maintainer: Jakub Chromec
description: |-
  Provides access to Trello API (<https://developers.trello.com/>).
  A family of GET functions make it easy to retrieve cards, labels, members,
  teams and other data from both public and private boards. Server responses
  are formatted upon retrieval. Automated paging allows for large requests
  that exceed server limit. See <https://github.com/jchrom/trelloR> for more
  information.
