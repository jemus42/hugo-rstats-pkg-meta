title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
maintainer: Daniel P. Palomar
description: |-
  Robust estimation methods for the mean vector and covariance matrix
  from data (possibly containing NAs) under multivariate heavy-tailed
  distributions such as angular Gaussian (via Tyler's method), Cauchy,
  and Student's t.
  Additionally, a factor model structure can be specified for the covariance
  matrix.
  The package is based on the papers: Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2014),
  Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2015), Liu and Rubin (1995), and
  Zhou, Liu, Kumar, and Palomar (2019).
