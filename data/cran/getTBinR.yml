title: Access and Summarise World Health Organisation Tuberculosis data
maintainer: Sam Abbott
description: |-
  Quickly and easily import analysis ready
  Tuberculosis (TB) burden data, from the World Health Organisation
  (WHO), into R. The aim of getTBinR is to allow researchers, and other
  interested individuals, to quickly and easily gain access to a
  detailed TB data set and to start using it to derive key insights. It
  provides a consistent set of tools that can be used to rapidly
  evaluate hypotheses on a widely used data set before they are explored
  further using more complex methods or more detailed data. These tools
  include: generic plotting and mapping functions; a data dictionary
  search tool; an interactive shiny dashboard; and an automated, country
  level, TB report. For newer R users, this package reduces the barrier
  to entry by handling data import, munging, and visualisation. All
  plotting and mapping functions are built with ggplot2 so can be
  readily extended.
