title: Detects spatial outliers using a Random Walk on Bipartite Graph
maintainer: Sigal Shaked
description: a Bipartite graph and is constructed based on the spatial and/or non-spatial
  attributes of the spatial objects in the dataset. Secondly, RW techniques are utilized
  on the graphs to compute the outlierness for each point (the differences between
  spatial objects and their spatial neighbours). The top k objects with higher outlierness
  are recognized as outliers.
