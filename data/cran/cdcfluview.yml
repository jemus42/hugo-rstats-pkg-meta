  Retrieve Flu Season Data from the United States Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention ('CDC') 'FluView' Portal
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  The 'U.S.' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintain
  a portal <https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html> for
  accessing state, regional and national influenza statistics as well as
  mortality surveillance data. The web interface makes it difficult and
  time-consuming to select and retrieve influenza data. Tools are provided
  to access the data provided by the portal's underlying 'API'.
