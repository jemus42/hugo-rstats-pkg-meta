title: Nonparametric Analysis of Covariance
maintainer: Xiao-Feng Wang
description: This package contains a collection of R functions to<U+000a>perform nonparametric
  analysis of covariance for regression<U+000a>curves or surfaces. Testing the equality
  or parallelism of<U+000a>nonparametric curves or surfaces is equivalent to analysis
  of<U+000a>variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for<U+000a>one-sample
  functional data. Three different testing methods are<U+000a>available in the package,
  including one based on L-2 distance,<U+000a>one based on an ANOVA statistic, and
  one based on variance<U+000a>estimators.
