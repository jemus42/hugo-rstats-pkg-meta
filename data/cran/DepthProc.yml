title: Statistical Depth Functions for Multivariate Analysis
maintainer: Zygmunt Zawadzki
description: |-
  Data depth concept offers a variety of powerful and user friendly
  tools for robust exploration and inference for multivariate data. The offered
  techniques may be successfully used in cases of lack of our knowledge on
  parametric models generating data due to their nature. The
  package consist of among others implementations of several data depth techniques
  involving multivariate quantile-quantile plots, multivariate scatter estimators,
  multivariate Wilcoxon tests and robust regressions.
