title: C++ Header Files for Stan
maintainer: Ben Goodrich
description: The C++ header files of the Stan project are provided by this package,
  but it contains no R code or function documentation. There is a shared object containing
  part of the 'CVODES' library, but it is not accessible from R. 'StanHeaders' is
  only useful for developers who want to utilize the 'LinkingTo' directive of their
  package's DESCRIPTION file to build on the Stan library without incurring unnecessary
  dependencies. The Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that
  implements full or approximate Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo or 'variational' methods and implements (optionally penalized) maximum likelihood
  estimation via optimization. The Stan library includes an advanced automatic differentiation
  scheme, 'templated' statistical and linear algebra functions that can handle the
  automatically 'differentiable' scalar types (and doubles, 'ints', etc.), and a parser
  for the Stan language. The 'rstan' package provides user-facing R functions to parse,
  compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.
