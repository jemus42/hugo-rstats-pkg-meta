  Weighted Mixed-Effects Models Using Multilevel Pseudo Maximum
  Likelihood Estimation
maintainer: Paul Bailey
description: Run mixed-effects models that include weights at every level. The WeMix
  package fits a weighted mixed model, also known as a multilevel, mixed, or hierarchical
  linear model (HLM). The weights could be inverse selection probabilities, such as
  those developed for an education survey where schools are sampled probabilistically,
  and then students inside of those schools are sampled probabilistically. Although
  mixed-effects models are already available in R, WeMix is unique in implementing
  methods for mixed models using weights at multiple levels. Both linear and logit
  models are supported. Models may have up to three levels.
