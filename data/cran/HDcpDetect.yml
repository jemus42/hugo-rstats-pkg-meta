title: Detect Change Points in Means of High Dimensional Data
maintainer: Natasha Stewart
description: 'Objective: Implement new methods for detecting change points in high-dimensional
  time series data. These new methods can be applied to non-Gaussian data, account
  for spatial and temporal dependence, and detect a wide variety of change-point configurations,
  including changes near the boundary and changes in close proximity. Additionally,
  this package helps address the “small n, large p” problem, which occurs in many
  research contexts. This problem arises when a dataset contains changes that are
  visually evident but do not rise to the level of statistical significance due to
  the small number of observations and large number of parameters. The problem is
  overcome by treating the dimensions as a whole and scaling the test statistics only
  by its standard deviation, rather than scaling each dimension individually. Due
  to the computational complexity of the functions, the package runs best on datasets
  with a relatively large number of attributes but no more than a few hundred observations.'
