title: Bayesian Estimation of the ETAS Model for Earthquake Occurrences
maintainer: Gordon J. Ross
description: The Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence  (ETAS) model is one of the best-performing
  methods for modeling and forecasting earthquake occurrences. This package implements
  Bayesian estimation routines to draw samples from the full posterior distribution
  of the model parameters, given an earthquake catalog. The paper on which this package
  is based is Gordon J. Ross - Bayesian Estimation of the ETAS Model for Earthquake
  Occurrences (2016), available from the below URL.
