title: Imputing Dropout Events in Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data
maintainer: Il-Youp Kwak
description: R codes for imputing dropout events. Many statistical methods in cell
  type identification, visualization and lineage reconstruction do not account for
  dropout events ('PCAreduce', 'SC3', 'PCA', 't-SNE', 'Monocle', 'TSCAN', etc). 'DrImpute'
  can improve the performance of such software by imputing dropout events.
