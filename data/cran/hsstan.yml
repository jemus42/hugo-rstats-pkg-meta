title: Hierarchical Shrinkage Stan Models for Biomarker Selection
maintainer: Marco Colombo
description: |-
  Linear and logistic regression models penalized with hierarchical
  shrinkage priors for selection of biomarkers (or more general variable
  selection), which can be fitted using Stan (Carpenter et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i01>). It implements the horseshoe and regularized
  horseshoe priors (Piironen and Vehtari (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-EJS1337SI>),
  as well as the projection predictive selection approach to recover a sparse
  set of predictive biomarkers (Piironen, Paasiniemi and Vehtari (2018)
  <arXiv:1810.02406>).
