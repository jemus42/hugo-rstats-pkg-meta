  Sparse Bayesian Models for Regression, Subgroup Analysis, and
  Panel Data
maintainer: Marc Ratkovic
description: 'Sparse modeling provides a mean selecting a small number of non-zero
  effects from a large possible number of candidate effects.  This package includes
  a suite of methods for sparse modeling: estimation via EM or MCMC, approximate confidence
  intervals with nominal coverage, and diagnostic and summary plots.  The method can
  implement sparse linear regression and sparse probit regression.  Beyond regression
  analyses, applications include subgroup analysis, particularly for conjoint experiments,
  and panel data. Future versions will include extensions to  models with truncated
  outcomes, propensity score, and instrumental variable analysis.'
