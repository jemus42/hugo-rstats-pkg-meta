title: Seed Germination Indices and Curve Fitting
maintainer: J. Aravind
description: |-
  Provides functions to compute various germination indices such as
  germinability, median germination time, mean germination time, mean
  germination rate, speed of germination, Timson's index, germination value,
  coefficient of uniformity of germination, uncertainty of germination
  process, synchrony of germination etc. from germination count data. Includes
  functions for fitting cumulative seed germination curves using
  four-parameter hill function and computation of associated parameters. See
  the vignette for more, including full list of citations for the methods
  implemented.
