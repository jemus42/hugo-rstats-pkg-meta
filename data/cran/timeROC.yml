title: Time-Dependent ROC Curve and AUC for Censored Survival Data
maintainer: Paul Blanche
description: Estimation of time-dependent ROC curve and area under time dependent
  ROC curve (AUC) in the presence of censored data, with or without competing risks.
  Confidence intervals of AUCs and tests for comparing AUCs of two rival markers measured
  on the same subjects can be computed, using the iid-representation of the AUC estimator.
  Plot functions for time-dependent ROC curves and AUC curves are provided. Time-dependent
  Positive Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values (NPV) can also be
  computed. See Blanche et al. (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5958> and references therein
  for the details of the methods implemented in the package.
