  Propensity score methods for assigning treatment in randomized
  trials
maintainer: Travis M. Loux
description: This package contains functions to run propensity-biased allocation to
  balance covariate distributions in sequential trials and propensity-constrained
  randomization to balance covariate distributions in trials with known baseline covariates
  at time of randomization.  Currently this package only supports trials comparing
  two groups.
