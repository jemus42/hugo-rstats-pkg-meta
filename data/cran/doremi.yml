title: Dynamics of Return to Equilibrium During Multiple Inputs
maintainer: Courvoisier Delphine
description: |-
  Provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated
  system experiencing exogenous inputs. The underlying models use differential
  equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to estimate the characteristic
  parameters of the equation (the coefficients) and an estimated signal. The
  package also provides print, summary, plot and predict functions, specific for
  the models outputs.
