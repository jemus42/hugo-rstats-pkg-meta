title: Selection Threshold Optimized Empirically via Splitting
maintainer: Marinela Capanu
description: A variable selection procedure for low to moderate size linear regressions
  models. This method repeatedly splits the data into two sets, one for estimation
  and one for validation, to obtain an empirically optimized threshold which is then
  used to screen for variables to include in the final model.
