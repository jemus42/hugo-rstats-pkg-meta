  Find the smallest circle that contains all longitude and latitude input points. From the generated center and radius, variable side polygons can be created, navigation based on bearing and distance can be applied, and more. Based on a modified version of Welzl's algorithm for smallest circle. Distance calculations are based on the haversine formula. Calculations for distance, midpoint, bearing and more are derived from <https://www.movable-type.co.uk>.
