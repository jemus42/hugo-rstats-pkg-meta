maintainer: Alexander Coppock
description: 'Randomization inference procedures for simple and complex randomized
  designs, including multi-armed trials, as described in Gerber and Green (2012, ISBN:
  978-0393979954). Users formally describe their randomization procedure and test
  statistic. The randomization distribution of the test statistic under some null
  hypothesis is efficiently simulated.'
