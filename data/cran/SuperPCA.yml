description: Dimension reduction of complex data with supervision from auxiliary information.
  The package contains a series of methods for different data types (e.g., multi-view
  or multi-way data) including the supervised singular value decomposition (SupSVD),
  supervised sparse and functional principal component (SupSFPC), supervised integrated
  factor analysis (SIFA) and supervised PARAFAC/CANDECOMP factorization (SupCP). When
  auxiliary data are available and potentially affect the intrinsic structure of the
  data of interest, the methods will accurately recover the underlying low-rank structure
  by taking into account the supervision from the auxiliary data. For more details,
  see the paper by Gen Li, <DOI:10.1111/biom.12698>.
