  Detecting Epistatic Selection with Partially Observed Genotype
  Data
maintainer: Pariya Behrouzi
description: |-
  An efficient multi-core package to reconstruct an underlying network of
  genomic signatures of high-dimensional epistatic selection from
  partially observed genotype data. The phenotype that we consider is viability.
  The network captures the conditional dependent short- and long-range linkage
  disequilibrium structure of genomes and thus reveals aberrant marker-marker
  associations that are due to epistatic selection. We target on high-dimensional
  genotype data where number of variables (markers) is larger than number of
  sample sizes (p >> n). The computations is memory-optimized using the sparse
  matrix output.
