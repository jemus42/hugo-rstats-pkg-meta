  from Bulk Genomics Data
maintainer: Amit Frishberg
description: Cellular population mapping (CPM) a deconvolution algorithm in which
  single-cell genomics is required in only one or a few samples, where in other samples
  of the same tissue, only bulk genomics is measured and the underlying fine resolution
  cellular heterogeneity is inferred.
