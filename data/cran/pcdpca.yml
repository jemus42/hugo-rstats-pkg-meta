  Dynamic Principal Components for Periodically Correlated
  Functional Time Series
maintainer: Lukasz Kidzinski
description: |-
  Method extends multivariate and functional dynamic principal components
  to periodically correlated multivariate time series. This package allows you to
  compute true dynamic principal components in the presence of periodicity.
  We follow implementation guidelines as described in Kidzinski, Kokoszka and
  Jouzdani (2017), in Principal component analysis of periodically correlated
  functional time series <arXiv:1612.00040>.
