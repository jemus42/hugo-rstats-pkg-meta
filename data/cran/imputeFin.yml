title: Imputation of Financial Time Series with Missing Values
maintainer: Daniel P. Palomar
description: |-
  Missing values often occur in financial data due to a variety
  of reasons (errors in the collection process or in the processing stage,
  lack of asset liquidity, lack of reporting of funds, etc.). However,
  most data analysis methods expect complete data and cannot be employed
  with missing values. One convenient way to deal with this issue without
  having to redesign the data analysis method is to impute the missing
  values. This package provides an efficient way to impute the missing
  values based on modeling the time series with a random walk or an
  autoregressive (AR) model, convenient to model log-prices and log-volumes
  in financial data. In the current version, the imputation is
  univariate-based (so no asset correlation is used).
  The package is based on the paper:
  J. Liu, S. Kumar, and D. P. Palomar (2019). Parameter Estimation of
  Heavy-Tailed AR Model With Missing Data Via Stochastic EM. IEEE Trans. on
  Signal Processing, vol. 67, no. 8, pp. 2159-2172. <doi:10.1109/TSP.2019.2899816>.
