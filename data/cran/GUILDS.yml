  Implementation of Sampling Formulas for the Unified Neutral
  Model of Biodiversity and Biogeography, with or without Guild
  Structure
maintainer: Thijs Janzen
description: A collection of sampling formulas for the unified neutral model of biogeography
  and biodiversity. Alongside the sampling formulas, it includes methods to perform
  maximum likelihood optimization of the sampling formulas, methods to generate data
  given the neutral model, and methods to estimate the expected species abundance
  distribution. Sampling formulas included in the GUILDS package are the Etienne Sampling
  Formula (Etienne 2005), the guild sampling formula, where guilds are assumed to
  differ in dispersal ability (Janzen et al. 2015), and  the guilds sampling formula
  conditioned on guild size (Janzen et al. 2015).
