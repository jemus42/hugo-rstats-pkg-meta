title: Actuarial Functions and Heavy Tailed Distributions
maintainer: Vincent Goulet
description: |-
  Functions and data sets for actuarial science:
  modeling of loss distributions; risk theory and ruin theory;
  simulation of compound models, discrete mixtures and compound
  hierarchical models; credibility theory. Support for many additional
  probability distributions to model insurance loss amounts and loss
  frequency: 19 continuous heavy tailed distributions; the
  Poisson-inverse Gaussian discrete distribution; zero-truncated and
  zero-modified extensions of the standard discrete distributions.
  Support for phase-type distributions commonly used to compute ruin
  probabilities.
