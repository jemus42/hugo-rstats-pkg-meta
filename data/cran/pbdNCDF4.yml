title: Programming with Big Data -- Interface to Parallel Unidata<U+000a>NetCDF4 Format
  Data Files
maintainer: Pragneshkumar Patel
description: This package adds collective parallel read and write capability<U+000a>to
  the R package ncdf4 version 1.8. Typical use is as a<U+000a>parallel NetCDF4 file
  reader in SPMD style programming. Each R<U+000a>process reads and writes its own
  data in a synchronized<U+000a>collective mode, resulting in faster parallel performance.<U+000a>Performance
  improvement is conditional on a parallel file system.
