title: Permutations and Mallows Distributions
maintainer: Ekhine Irurozki
description: |-
  Includes functions to work with the Mallows and Generalized Mallows
  Models. The considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam
  and it includes functions for making inference, sampling and learning such
  distributions, some of which are novel in the literature. As a by-product,
  PerMallows also includes operations for permutations, paying special attention
  to those related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam and Hamming distances. It
  is also possible to generate random permutations at a given distance, or with
  a given number of inversions, or cycles, or fixed points or even with a given
  length on LIS (longest increasing subsequence).
