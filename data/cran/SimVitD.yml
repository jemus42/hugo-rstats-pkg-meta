description: "Simulation tools for planning Vitamin D studies including\napproximation
  of power. Individual vitamin D status\nprofiles are simulated, modelling population
  heterogeneity.\nIndividuals experience random exposures to infectious \t\tagents.
  Development of infection considers a heterogeneous treatment effect. This is incorporated
  into the power approximation."
