title: Plot Raster Graphics in PDF Files
maintainer: Ilari Scheinin
description: |-
  The ability to plot raster graphics in PDF files can be useful
  when one needs multi-page documents, but the plots contain so many
  individual elements that (the usual) use of vector graphics results in
  inconveniently large file sizes. Internally, the package plots each
  individual page as a PNG, and then combines them in one PDF file.
