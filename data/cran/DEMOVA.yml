description: 'Tool for the development of multi-linear QSPR/QSAR models (Quantitative
  structure-property/activity relationship). Theses models are used in chemistry,
  biology and pharmacy to find a relationship between the structure of a molecule
  and its property (such as activity, toxicology but also physical properties). The
  various functions of this package allows: selection of descriptors based of variances,
  intercorrelation and user expertise; selection of the best multi-linear regression
  in terms of correlation and robustness; methods of internal validation (Leave-One-Out,
  Leave-Many-Out, Y-scrambling) and external using test sets.'
