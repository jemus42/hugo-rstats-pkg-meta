maintainer: Isabelle Charlier
description: |-
  Estimation of conditional quantiles using optimal quantization.
  Construction of an optimal grid of N quantizers, estimation of conditional
  quantiles and data driven selection of the size N of the grid. Graphical
  illustrations for the selection of N and of resulting estimated curves or
  surfaces when the dimension of the covariate is one or two.
