  Flexible Phenotype Simulation from Different Genetic and Noise
  Models
maintainer: Hannah Meyer
description: |-
  Simulation is a critical part of method development and assessment
  in quantitative genetics. 'PhenotypeSimulator' allows for the flexible
  simulation of phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant
  and  infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well
  as non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and additional
  correlation effects. The different phenotype components are combined into a
  final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained
  by each of the components. For each effect component, the number of
  variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits
  can be customised. For the simulation of the genetic effects, external
  genotype data from a number of standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/
  'impute2', 'genome', 'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final
  simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically saved into .rds
  or .csv files. In addition, they can be saved in formats compatible with
  commonly used genetic association software ('gemma', 'bimbam', 'plink',
  'snptest', 'LiMMBo').
