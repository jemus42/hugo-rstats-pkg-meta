title: Cluster and Merge Similar Values Within a Character Vector
maintainer: Chris Muir
description: |-
  These functions take a character vector as input, identify and
  cluster similar values, and then merge clusters together so their values
  become identical. The functions are an implementation of the key collision
  and ngram fingerprint algorithms from the open source tool Open Refine
  <http://openrefine.org/>. More info on key collision and ngram fingerprint
  can be found here <https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth>.
