title: Create and Manipulate Discrete Random Variables
maintainer: Eric Hare
description: |-
  Create, manipulate, transform, and simulate from discrete random
  variables. The syntax is modeled after that which is used in mathematical
  statistics and probability courses, but with powerful support for more
  advanced probability calculations. This includes the creation of joint
  random variables, and the derivation and manipulation of their conditional
  and marginal distributions.
