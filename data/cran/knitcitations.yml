version: 1.0.10
title: Citations for 'Knitr' Markdown Files
maintainer: Carl Boettiger
description: |-
  Provides the ability to create dynamic citations
  in which the bibliographic information is pulled from the web rather
  than having to be entered into a local database such as 'bibtex' ahead of
  time. The package is primarily aimed at authoring in the R 'markdown'
  format, and can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked
  text for inline citations.  Cite using a 'DOI', URL, or
  'bibtex' file key.  See the package URL for details.
