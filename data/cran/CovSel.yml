title: Model-Free Covariate Selection
maintainer: Jenny Häggström
description: Model-free selection of covariates under unconfoundedness for situations
  where the parameter of interest is an average causal effect. This package is based
  on  model-free backward elimination algorithms proposed in de Luna, Waernbaum and
  Richardson (2011). Marginal co-ordinate hypothesis testing is used in situations
  where all covariates are continuous while kernel-based smoothing appropriate for
  mixed data is used otherwise.
