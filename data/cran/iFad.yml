  An integrative factor analysis model for drug-pathway
  association inference
maintainer: Haisu Ma
description: This package implements a Bayesian sparse factor model for the joint
  analysis of paired datasets, one is the gene expression dataset and the other is
  the drug sensitivity profiles, measured across the same panel of samples, e.g.,
  cell lines. Prior knowledge about gene-pathway associations can be easily incorporated
  in the model to aid the inference of drug-pathway associations.
