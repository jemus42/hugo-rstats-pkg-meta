title: Lilliefors-Corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit Tests
maintainer: Phil Novack-Gottshall
description: |-
  Implements the Lilliefors-corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for use
  in goodness-of-fit tests, suitable when population parameters are unknown and
  must be estimated by sample statistics. P-values are estimated by simulation.
  Can be used with a variety of continuous distributions, including normal,
  lognormal, univariate mixtures of normals, uniform, loguniform, exponential,
  gamma, and Weibull distributions. Functions to generate random numbers and
  calculate density, distribution, and quantile functions are provided for use
  with the log uniform and mixture distributions.
