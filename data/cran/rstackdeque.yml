title: Persistent Fast Amortized Stack and Queue Data Structures
maintainer: Shawn T. O'Neil
description: |-
  Provides fast, persistent (side-effect-free) stack, queue and
  deque (double-ended-queue) data structures. While deques include a superset
  of functionality provided by queues, in these implementations queues are
  more efficient in some specialized situations. See the documentation for
  rstack, rdeque, and rpqueue for details.
