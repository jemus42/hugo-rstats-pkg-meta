title: Correct and Cluster Response Style Biased Data
maintainer: Mariko Takagishi
description: 'Functions for performing Correcting and Clustering response-style-biased
  preference data (CCRS). The main functions are correct.RS() for correcting for response
  styles, and ccrs() for simultaneously correcting and content-based clustering. The
  procedure begin with making rank-ordered boundary data from the given preference
  matrix using a function called create.ccrsdata(). Then in correct.RS(), the response
  style is corrected as follows: the rank-ordered boundary data are smoothed by I-spline
  functions, the given preference data are transformed by the smoothed functions.
  The resulting data matrix, which is considered as bias-corrected data, can be used
  for any data analysis methods. If one wants to cluster respondents based on their
  indicated preferences (content-based clustering), ccrs() can be applied to the given
  (response-style-biased) preference data, which simultaneously corrects for response
  styles and clusters respondents based on the contents. Also, the correction result
  can be checked by plot.crs() function.'
