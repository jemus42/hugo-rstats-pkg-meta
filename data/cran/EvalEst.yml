title: Dynamic Systems Estimation - Extensions
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Provides functions for evaluating (time series) model
  estimation methods. These facilitate Monte Carlo experiments of repeated
  simulations and estimations. Also provides methods for
  looking at the distribution of the results from these experiments,
  including model roots (which are an equivalence class invariant).
