maintainer: Ian Cook
description: |-
  Utility functions to convert between the 'Spatial' classes
  specified by the package 'sp', and the well-known binary '(WKB)'
  representation for geometry specified by the 'Open Geospatial Consortium'.
  Supports 'Spatial' objects of class 'SpatialPoints',
  'SpatialPointsDataFrame', 'SpatialLines', 'SpatialLinesDataFrame',
  'SpatialPolygons', and 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'. Supports 'WKB' geometry
  types 'Point', 'LineString', 'Polygon', 'MultiPoint', 'MultiLineString', and
  'MultiPolygon'. Includes extensions to enable creation of maps with
