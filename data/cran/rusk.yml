  Beautiful Graphical Representation of Multiplication Tables on a
  Modular Circle
maintainer: Vincent Guyader
description: By placing on a circle 10 points numbered from 1 to 10, and connecting
  them by a straight line to the point corresponding to its multiplication by 2. (1
  must be connected to 1 * 2 = 2, point 2 must be set to 2 * 2 = 4, point 3 to 3 *
  2 = 6 and so on). You will obtain an amazing geometric figure that complicates and
  beautifies itself by varying the number of points and the multiplication table you
  use.
