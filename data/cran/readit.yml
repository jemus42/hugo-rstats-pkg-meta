title: Effortlessly Read Any Rectangular Data
maintainer: Ryan Price
description: |2-

  Providing just one primary function, 'readit' uses a set of reasonable
  heuristics to apply the appropriate reader function to the given file path.
  As long as the data file has an extension, and the data is (or can be
  coerced to be) rectangular, readit() can probably read it.
