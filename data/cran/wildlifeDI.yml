  Calculate Indices of Dynamic Interaction for Wildlife Tracking
  Data
maintainer: Jed Long
description: |-
  Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations
  in the movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for
  calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction with
  wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods employed
  see the references within. The package (as of version 0.3) also has new tools for
  automating contact analysis in large tracking datasets. The package draws
  heavily on the classes and methods developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
