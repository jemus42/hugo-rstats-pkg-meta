  Automated Transcriptome Classifier Pipeline: Comprehensive
  Transcriptome Analysis
maintainer: Karam Daka
description: |-
  An unsupervised fully-automated pipeline for transcriptome analysis or a supervised option to identify characteristic genes from predefined subclasses.
  We rely on the 'pamr' <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages//2.7/bioc/html/pamr.html> clustering algorithm to cluster the Data and then draw a heatmap of the clusters with the most significant genes and the
  least significant genes according to the 'pamr' algorithm. This way we get easy to grasp heatmaps that show us for each cluster which are the clusters most defining genes.
