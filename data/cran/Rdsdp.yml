title: R Interface to DSDP Semidefinite Programming Library
maintainer: Zhisu Zhu
description: R interface to DSDP semidefinite programming library. The DSDP software
  is a free open source implementation of an interior-point method for semidefinite
  programming. It provides primal and dual solutions, exploits low-rank structure
  and sparsity in the data, and has relatively low memory requirements for an interior-point
  method.
