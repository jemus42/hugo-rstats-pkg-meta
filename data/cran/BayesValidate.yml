title: BayesValidate Package
maintainer: Samantha Cook
description: BayesValidate implements the software validation method<U+000a>described
  in the paper "Validation of Software for Bayesian<U+000a>Models using Posterior
  Quantiles" (Cook, Gelman, and Rubin,<U+000a>2005).  It inputs a function to perform
  Bayesian inference as<U+000a>well as functions to generate data from the Bayesian
  model<U+000a>being fit, and repeatedly generates and analyzes data to check<U+000a>that
  the Bayesian inference program works properly.
