title: Wizardry Code Offensive Programming
maintainer: Fabien Gelineau
description: |-
  Allows to turn standard R code into offensive programming code.
  Provides code instrumentation to ease this change and tools to assist and
  accelerate code production and tuning while using offensive programming code
  technics.
  Should improve code robustness and quality. Function calls can be easily
  verified on-demand or in batch mode to assess parameter types and length
  conformities.
  Should improve coders productivity as offensive programming reduces the code
  size due to reduced number of controls all along the call chain.
  Should speed up processing as many checks will be reduced to one single check.
