title: Tools for Customer Lifetime Value Estimation
maintainer: Patrick Bachmann
description: |-
  Probabilistic latent customer attrition models (also known as "buy-'til-you-die models") are used to
  predict future purchase behavior of customers. This package includes fast and accurate implementations of various
  probabilistic latent customer attrition models for non-contractual settings (e.g., retail business) with and
  without time-invariant and time-varying covariates. Currently, the package includes the Pareto/NBD model
  (Pareto/Negative-Binomial-Distribution) for the purchase and the attrition processes as well as the Gamma/Gamma model
  for the spending process. For reference to the Pareto/NBD model, see Schmittlein DC, Morrison DG, Colombo R (1987) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.33.1.1>.
  For reference to the Gamma/Gamma model, see Fader PS, Hardie BG, Lee K (2005) <doi:10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.415>.
