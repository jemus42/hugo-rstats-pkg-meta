  Large-Scale Bayesian Variable Selection Using Variational
  Methods
maintainer: Peter Carbonetto
description: |-
  Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection
  models and computing Bayes factors, in which the outcome (or
  response variable) is modeled using a linear regression or a
  logistic regression. The algorithms are based on the variational
  approximations described in "Scalable variational inference for
  Bayesian variable selection in regression, and its accuracy in
  genetic association studies" (P. Carbonetto & M. Stephens, 2012,
  <DOI:10.1214/12-BA703>). This software has been applied to large
  data sets with over a million variables and thousands of samples.
