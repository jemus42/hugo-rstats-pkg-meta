title: Compare Models with Cross-Validated Log-Likelihood

description: An implementation of the cross-validated difference in means (CVDM) test
  by Desmarais and Harden (2014) <doi:10.1007/s11135-013-9884-7> (see also Harden
  and Desmarais, 2011 <doi:10.1177/1532440011408929>) and the cross-validated median
  fit (CVMF) test by Desmarais and Harden (2012) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpr042>. These tests
  use leave-one-out cross-validated log-likelihoods to assist in selecting among model
  estimations. You can also utilize data from Golder (2010) <doi:10.1177/0010414009341714>
  and Joshi & Mason (2008) <doi:10.1177/0022343308096155> that are included to facilitate
  examples from real-world analysis.
