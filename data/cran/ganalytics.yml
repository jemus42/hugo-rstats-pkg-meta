title: Interact with 'Google Analytics'
maintainer: Johann de Boer
description: |-
  Functions for querying the 'Google Analytics' core reporting,
  real-time, multi-channel funnel and management APIs, as well as the 'Google
  Tag Manager' (GTM) API. Write methods are also provided for the management
  and GTM APIs so that you can change tag, property or view settings, for
  example. Define reporting queries using natural R expressions instead of
  being concerned as much about API technical intricacies like query syntax,
  character code escaping, and API limitations.
