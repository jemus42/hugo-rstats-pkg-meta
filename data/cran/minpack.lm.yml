  R Interface to the Levenberg-Marquardt Nonlinear Least-Squares
  Algorithm Found in MINPACK, Plus Support for Bounds
maintainer: Katharine M. Mullen
description: The nls.lm function provides an R interface to lmder and lmdif from the
  MINPACK library, for solving nonlinear least-squares problems by a modification
  of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, with support for lower and upper parameter
  bounds.  The implementation can be used via nls-like calls using the nlsLM function.
