  Common Forms for Complex Hierarchical and Relational Data
  Structures
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Generate common data forms for complex data suitable for conversions and
  transmission by decomposition as paths or primitives. Paths are sequentially-linked records,
  primitives are basic atomic elements and both can model many forms and be grouped into hierarchical
  structures.  The universal models 'SC0' (structural) and 'SC' (labelled, relational) are composed of
  edges and can represent any hierarchical form. Specialist models 'PATH', 'ARC' and 'TRI' provide the
  most common intermediate forms used for converting from one form to another. The methods are
  inspired by the simplicial complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex> and
  provide intermediate forms that relate spatial data structures to this mathematical construct.
