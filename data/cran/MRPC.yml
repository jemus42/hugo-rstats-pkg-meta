title: PC Algorithm with the Principle of Mendelian Randomization
maintainer: Md Bahadur Badsha
description: |-
  A PC Algorithm with the Principle of Mendelian Randomization. This package implements the MRPC
  (PC with the principle of Mendelian randomization) algorithm to infer causal graphs. It also
  contains functions to simulate data under a certain topology, to visualize a graph in different
  ways, and to compare graphs and quantify the differences.
