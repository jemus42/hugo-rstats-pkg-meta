maintainer: Victor Freguglia
description: |-
  Model fitting, sampling and visualization
  for the (Hidden) Markov Random Field model with pairwise interactions and
  general interaction structure from
  Freguglia, Garcia & Bicas (2019) <doi:10.1002/env.2613>,
  which has many popular models used in 2-dimensional lattices
  as particular cases, like the Ising Model and Potts Model.
