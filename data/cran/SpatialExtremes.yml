title: Modelling Spatial Extremes
maintainer: Mathieu Ribatet
description: 'Tools for the statistical modelling of spatial extremes using max-stable
  processes, copula or Bayesian hierarchical models. More precisely, this package
  allows (conditional) simulations from various parametric max-stable models, analysis
  of the extremal spatial dependence, the fitting of such processes using composite
  likelihoods or least square (simple max-stable processes only), model checking and
  selection and prediction. Other approaches (although not completely in agreement
  with the extreme value theory) are available such as the use of (spatial) copula
  and Bayesian hierarchical models assuming the so-called conditional assumptions.
  The latter approaches is handled through an (efficient) Gibbs sampler. Some key
