title: Backwards Variable Selection for Paths using M Plus
maintainer: William Terry
description: Primarily for use with datasets containing only categorical variables,
  although continuous variables may be included as independent variables in paths.
  Using M Plus, backward variable selection is performed on all Total, Total Indirect,
  and then Direct effects until none of these effects have p-values greater than the
  specified target p-value. If there are missing values in the data, imputations are
  performed using the Mice package. Then selection is performed with the imputed data
  sets, and results are averaged.
