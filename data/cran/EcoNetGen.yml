title: Simulate and Sample from Ecological Interaction Networks
maintainer: Carl Boettiger
description: |-
  Randomly generate a wide range of interaction networks with
  specified size, average degree, modularity, and topological
  structure. Sample nodes and links from within simulated networks
  randomly, by degree, by module, or by abundance. Simulations
  and sampling routines are implemented in 'FORTRAN', providing
  efficient generation times even for large networks. Basic
  visualization methods also included. Algorithms implemented
  here are described in de Aguiar et al. (2017) <arXiv:1708.01242>.
