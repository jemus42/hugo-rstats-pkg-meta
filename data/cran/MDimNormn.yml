title: Multi-Dimensional MA Normalization for Plate Effect
maintainer: Mun-Gwan Hong
description: |-
  Normalize data to minimize the difference between sample plates
  (batch effects). For given data in a matrix and grouping variable (or
  plate), the function 'normn_MA' normalizes the data on MA coordinates.
  More details are in the citation. The primary method is 'Multi-MA'. Other
  fitting functions on MA coordinates can also be employed e.g. loess.
