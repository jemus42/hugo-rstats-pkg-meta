description: YACFP (Yet Another Convenience Function Package). get_age() is a fast
  & accurate tool for measuring fractional years between two dates. abbr_to_colClass()
  is a much more concise way of feeding many types to a colClass argument in a data
  reader. stale_package_check() tries to identify any library() calls to unused packages.
