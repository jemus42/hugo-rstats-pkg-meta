title: High Level Encryption Wrappers
maintainer: Rich FitzJohn
description: |-
  Encryption wrappers, using low-level support from
  'sodium' and 'openssl'.  'cyphr' tries to smooth over some pain
  points when using encryption within applications and data analysis
  by wrapping around differences in function names and arguments in
  different encryption providing packages.  It also provides
  high-level wrappers for input/output functions for seamlessly
  adding encryption to existing analyses.
