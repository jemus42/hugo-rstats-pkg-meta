  'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Armadillo' Templated Linear Algebra
  Library
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad
  Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
  floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
  trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
  provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
  The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the templated
  'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install 'Armadillo' itself in
  order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is
  licensed under Apache License 2; previous releases were under licensed as
  MPL 2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that;
  'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under
  the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that
  Armadillo requires a fairly recent compiler; for the g++ family at least
  version 4.6.* is required.
