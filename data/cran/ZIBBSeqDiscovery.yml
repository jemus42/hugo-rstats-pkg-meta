title: Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Modeling of Microbiome Count Data
maintainer: Yihui Zhou
description: Microbiome count data (Operational Taxonomic Unit, OTUs) is usually overdispersed
  and has excessive zero counts. The 'ZIBBSeqDiscovery' assumes a zero-inflated beta-binomial
  model for the distribution of the count data, and employes link functions to adjust
  interested covariates. To fit the model, two approaches are proposed (i) a free
  approach which treats the overdispersion parameters for OTUs as independent, and
  (ii) a constrained approach which proposes a mean-overdispersion relationship to
  the count data. This package can be used to test the association between the composition
  of the microbiome counts and the interested covariates.
