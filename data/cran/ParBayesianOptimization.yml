title: Parallel Bayesian Optimization of Hyperparameters
maintainer: Samuel Wilson
description: |-
  Fast, flexible framework for implementing Bayesian optimization of model
  hyperparameters according to the methods described in Snoek et al. <arXiv:1206.2944>.
  The package allows the user to run scoring function in parallel, save intermediary
  results, and tweak other aspects of the process to fully utilize the computing resources
  available to the user.
