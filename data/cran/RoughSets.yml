title: Data Analysis Using Rough Set and Fuzzy Rough Set Theories
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: |-
  Implementations of algorithms for data analysis based on the
  rough set theory (RST) and the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST). We not only
  provide implementations for the basic concepts of RST and FRST but also
  popular algorithms that derive from those theories. The methods included in the
  package can be divided into several categories based on their functionality:
  discretization, feature selection, instance selection, rule induction and
  classification based on nearest neighbors. RST was introduced by Zdzis≈Çaw
  Pawlak in 1982 as a sophisticated mathematical tool to model and process
  imprecise or incomplete information. By using the indiscernibility relation for
  objects/instances, RST does not require additional parameters to analyze the
  data. FRST is an extension of RST. The FRST combines concepts of vagueness and
  indiscernibility that are expressed with fuzzy sets (as proposed by Zadeh, in
  1965) and RST.
