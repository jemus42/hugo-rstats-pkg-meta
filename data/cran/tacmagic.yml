title: Positron Emission Tomography Time-Activity Curve Analysis
maintainer: Eric Brown
description: |-
  To facilitate the analysis of positron emission tomography (PET)
  time activity curve (TAC) data, and to encourage open science and
  replicability, this package supports data loading and analysis of multiple
  TAC file formats. Functions are available to analyze loaded TAC data for
  individual participants or in batches. Major functionality includes weighted
  TAC merging by region of interest (ROI), calculating models including
  standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR,
  Logan et al. 1996 <doi:10.1097/00004647-199609000-00008>), basic plotting
  functions and calculation of cut-off values (Aizenstein et al. 2008
  <doi:10.1001/archneur.65.11.1509>). Please see the walkthrough vignette for
  a detailed overview of 'tacmagic' functions.
