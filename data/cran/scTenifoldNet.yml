title: Construct and Compare scGRN from Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data
maintainer: Daniel Osorio
description: A workflow based on machine learning methods to construct and compare
  single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRN) using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
  data collected from different conditions. Uses principal component regression, tensor
  decomposition, and manifold alignment, to accurately identify even subtly shifted
  gene expression programs.
