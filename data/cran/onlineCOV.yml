  Online Change Point Detection in High-Dimensional Covariance
  Structure
maintainer: Jun Li
description: Implement a new stopping rule to detect anomaly in the covariance structure
  of high-dimensional online data. The detection procedure can be applied to Gaussian
  or non-Gaussian data with a large number of components. Moreover, it allows both
  spatial and temporal dependence in data. The dependence can be estimated by a data-driven
  procedure. The level of threshold in the stopping rule can be determined at a pre-selected
  average run length. More detail can be seen in Li, L. and Li, J. (2020) "Online
  Change-Point Detection in High-Dimensional Covariance Structure with Application
  to Dynamic Networks." <arXiv:1911.07762>.
