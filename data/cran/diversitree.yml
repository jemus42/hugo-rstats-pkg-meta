title: Comparative 'Phylogenetic' Analyses of Diversification
maintainer: Richard G. FitzJohn
description: |-
  Contains a number of comparative 'phylogenetic' methods,
  mostly focusing on analysing diversification and character
  evolution.  Contains implementations of 'BiSSE' (Binary State
  'Speciation' and Extinction) and its unresolved tree extensions,
  'MuSSE' (Multiple State 'Speciation' and Extinction), 'QuaSSE',
  'GeoSSE', and 'BiSSE-ness' Other included methods include Markov
  models of discrete and continuous trait evolution and constant rate
  'speciation' and extinction.
