  Semiparametric Factor and Regression Models for Symmetric
  Relational Data
maintainer: Peter Hoff
description: |-
  Estimation of the parameters in a model for
  symmetric relational data (e.g., the above-diagonal part of a
  square matrix), using a model-based eigenvalue decomposition
  and regression. Missing data is accommodated, and a posterior
  mean for missing data is calculated under the assumption that
  the data are missing at random. The marginal distribution of
  the relational data can be arbitrary, and is fit with an
  ordered probit specification. See Hoff (2007) <arXiv:0711.1146>
  for details on the model.
