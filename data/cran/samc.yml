title: Spatial Absorbing Markov Chains
maintainer: Andrew Marx
description: |-
  An implementation of the framework described in "Toward a unified
  framework for connectivity that disentangles movement and mortality in space
  and time" by Fletcher et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/ele.13333>.
  Incorporates both resistance and absorption with spatial absorbing Markov
  chains (SAMC) to provide several short-term and long-term predictions for
  metrics related to connectivity in landscapes.
