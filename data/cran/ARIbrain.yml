maintainer: Livio Finos
description: |-
  It performs All-Resolutions Inference (ARI) on functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) data. As a main feature,
  it estimates lower bounds for the proportion of active voxels in a set of clusters as, for example, given by a cluster-wise analysis.
  The method is described in Rosenblatt, Finos, Weeda, Solari, Goeman (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.060>.
