title: Multiverse Analysis of Multinomial Processing Tree Models
maintainer: Henrik Singmann
description: |2-

  Statistical or cognitive modeling usually requires a number of more or less
  arbitrary choices creating one specific path through a 'garden of forking paths'.
  The multiverse approach (Steegen, Tuerlinckx, Gelman, & Vanpaemel, 2016,
  <doi:10.1177/1745691616658637>) offers a principled alternative in which results
  for all possible combinations of reasonable modeling choices are reported.
  MPTmultiverse performs a multiverse analysis for multinomial processing tree
  (MPT, Riefer & Batchelder, 1988, <doi:10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.318>) models combining
  maximum-likelihood/frequentist and Bayesian estimation approaches with
  different levels of pooling (i.e., data aggregation). For the
  frequentist approaches, no pooling (with and without parametric or nonparametric
  bootstrap) and complete pooling are implemented using
  MPTinR <https://cran.r-project.org/package=MPTinR>.
  For the Bayesian approaches, no pooling, complete pooling, and three different
  variants of partial pooling are implemented using
  TreeBUGS <https://cran.r-project.org/package=TreeBUGS>. The main function is
  fit_mpt() who performs the multiverse analysis in one call.
