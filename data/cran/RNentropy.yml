  Entropy Based Method for the Detection of Significant Variation
  in Gene Expression Data
maintainer: Federico Zambelli
description: |-
  An implementation of a method based on information theory devised
  for the identification of genes showing a significant variation of expression
  across multiple conditions. Given expression estimates from any number of
  RNA-Seq samples and conditions it identifies genes or transcripts with a
  significant variation of expression across all the conditions studied,
  together with the samples in which they are over- or under-expressed.
