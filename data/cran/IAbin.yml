  Plotting N-T Plane for Decision on Performing an Interim
  Analysis

description: |-
  In randomized-controlled trials, interim analyses are often planned for possible early
  trial termination to claim superiority or futility of a new therapy. Blinded data also have
  information about the potential treatment difference between the groups. We developed a blinded
  data monitoring tool that enables investigators to predict whether they observe such an unblinded
  interim analysis results that supports early termination of the trial. Investigators may skip
  some of the planned interim analyses if an early termination is unlikely.
  This tool will provide reference information about N: Sample size at interim analysis, and T: Total
  number of responders at interim analysis for decision on performing an interim analysis.
