  Runiversal - Package for converting R objects to Java variables
  and XML.
maintainer: Mehmet Hakan Satman
description: |-
  This package contains some functions for converting R
  objects to Java style variables and XML. Generated Java code is
  interpretable by dynamic Java libraries such as Beanshell.
  Calling R externally and handling the Java or XML output is an
  other way to call R from other languages without native
  interfaces. For a Java implementation of this approach visit
