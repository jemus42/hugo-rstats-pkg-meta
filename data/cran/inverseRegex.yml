title: Reverse Engineers Regular Expression Patterns for R Objects
maintainer: Jasper Watson
description: |-
  Reverse engineer a regular expression pattern for the characters
  contained in an R object. Individual characters can be categorised into
  digits, letters, punctuation or spaces and encoded into run-lengths. This
  can be used to summarise the structure of a dataset or identify non-standard
  entries. Many non-character inputs such as numeric vectors and data frames
  are supported.
