  Reporting Tools for Sensitivity Analysis of Evidence Factors in
  Observational Studies
maintainer: Bikram Karmakar
description: |-
  Provides tools for integrated sensitivity analysis of evidence factors in observational
  studies. When an observational study allows for multiple independent or nearly
  independent inferences which, if vulnerable, are vulnerable to different biases, we have
  multiple evidence factors.  This package provides methods that respect type I error rate control.
  Examples are provided of integrated evidence factors analysis in a longitudinal study with
  continuous outcome and in a case-control study.
