title: Learn Text 'Embeddings' with 'Starspace'
maintainer: Jan Wijffels
description: |-
  Wraps the 'StarSpace' library <https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace>
  allowing users to calculate word, sentence, article, document, webpage, link and entity 'embeddings'.
  By using the 'embeddings', you can perform text based multi-label classification,
  find similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-filtering based recommendation
  as well as content-based recommendation, find out relations between entities, calculate
  graph 'embeddings' as well as perform semi-supervised learning and multi-task learning on plain text.
  The techniques are explained in detail in the paper: 'StarSpace: Embed All The Things!' by Wu et al. (2017), available at <arXiv:1709.03856>.
