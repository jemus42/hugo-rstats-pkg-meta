  Simulating Community Assembly and Ecological Diversification
  Using Ecospace Frameworks
maintainer: Phil Novack-Gottshall
description: |-
  Implements stochastic simulations of community assembly (ecological
  diversification) using customizable ecospace frameworks (functional trait
  spaces). Provides a wrapper to calculate common ecological disparity and
  functional ecology statistical dynamics as a function of species richness.
  Functions are written so they will work in a parallel-computing environment.
