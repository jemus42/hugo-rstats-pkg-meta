title: Translate ICD-9 into Injury Severity Score
maintainer: Dajun Tian
description: |-
  Calculate the injury severity score (ISS)
  based on the dictionary in 'ICDPIC' from <https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457028.html>. The original code was written in
  'STATA 11'. The original 'STATA' code was written by David Clark,
  Turner Osler and David Hahn. I implement the same logic for easier access.
