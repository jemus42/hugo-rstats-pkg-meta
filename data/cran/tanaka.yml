title: Design Shaded Contour Lines (or Tanaka) Maps
maintainer: Timoth√©e Giraud
description: The Tanaka method enhances the representation of topography on a map
  using shaded contour lines. In this simplified implementation of the method, north-west
  white contours represent illuminated topography and south-east black contours represent
  shaded topography. See Tanaka (1950) <doi:10.2307/211219>.
