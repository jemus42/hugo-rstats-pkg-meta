  Visual Exploration of Protein Alignments Resulting from Multiple
  Substitution Matrices
maintainer: Scott Barlowe
description: Substitution matrices are important parameters in protein alignment algorithms.
  These matrices represent the likelihood that an amino acid will be substituted for
  another during mutation. This tool allows users to apply predefined and custom matrices
  and then explore the resulting alignments with interactive visualizations.  'SubVis'
  requires the availability of a web browser.
