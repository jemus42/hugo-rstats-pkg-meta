title: Greedy Experimental Design Construction
maintainer: Adam Kapelner
description: |-
  Computes experimental designs for a
  two-arm experiment with covariates by greedily optimizing a
  balance objective function. This optimization provides lower
  variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher power)
  while preserving a design that is close to complete randomization.
  We return all iterations of the designs for use in a permutation test.
  Additional functionality includes using branch and bound optimization
  (via Gurobi) and exhaustive enumeration.
