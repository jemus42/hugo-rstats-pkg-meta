maintainer: Qian Li
description: |-
  Two-Step Lasso (TS-Lasso) and compound minimum methods to recover
  the abundance of missing peaks in mass spectrum analysis. TS-Lasso is an
  imputation method that handles various types of missing peaks simultaneously. This package
  provides the procedure to generate missing peaks (or data) for simulation study,
  as well as a tool to estimate and visualize the proportion of missing at random.
