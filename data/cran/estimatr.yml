title: Fast Estimators for Design-Based Inference
maintainer: Graeme Blair
description: Fast procedures for small set of commonly-used, design-appropriate estimators
  with robust standard errors and confidence intervals. Includes estimators for linear
  regression, instrumental variables regression, difference-in-means, Horvitz-Thompson
  estimation, and regression improving precision of experimental estimates by interacting
  treatment with centered pre-treatment covariates introduced by Lin (2013) <doi:10.1214/12-AOAS583>.
