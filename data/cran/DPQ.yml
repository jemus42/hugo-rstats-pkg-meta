title: Density, Probability, Quantile ('DPQ') Computations
maintainer: Martin Maechler
description: |-
  Computations for approximations and alternatives for the 'DPQ'
  (Density (pdf), Probability (cdf) and Quantile) functions for probability
  distributions in R.
  Primary focus is on (central and non-central) beta, gamma and related
  distributions such as the chi-squared, F, and t.
  --
  This is for the use of researchers in these numerical approximation
  implementations, notably for my own use in order to improve R`s own
  pbeta(), qgamma(), ..., etc: {'"dpq"'-functions}.
  -- We plan to complement with 'DPQmpfr' to be suggested later.
