title: Patient Subgroup Identification for Clinical Drug Development
maintainer: Xin Huang
description: Function Wrapper contains four algorithms for developing threshold-based
  multivariate (prognostic/predictive) biomarker signatures via bootstrapping and
  aggregating of thresholds from trees, Monte-Carlo variations of the Adaptive Indexing
  method and Patient Rule Induction Method. Variable selection is automatically built-in
  to these algorithms. Final signatures are returned with interaction plots for predictive
  signatures. Cross-validation performance evaluation and testing dataset results
  are also output.
