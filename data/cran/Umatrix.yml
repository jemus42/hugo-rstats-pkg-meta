title: Visualization of Structures in High-Dimensional Data
maintainer: Florian Lerch
description: By gaining the property of emergence through self-organization, the enhancement
  of SOMs(self organizing maps) is called Emergent SOM (ESOM). The result of the projection
  by ESOM is a grid of neurons which can be visualised as a three dimensional landscape
  in form of the Umatrix. Further details can be found in the referenced publications
  (see url). This package offers tools for calculating and visualising the ESOM as
  well as Umatrix, Pmatrix and UStarMatrix. All the functionality is also available
  through graphical user interfaces implemented in 'shiny'.
