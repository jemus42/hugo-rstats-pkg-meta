  Estimation of Heritability in High Dimensional Sparse Linear
  Mixed Models using Variable Selection
maintainer: Anna Bonnet
description: Our method is a variable selection method to select active components
  in sparse linear mixed models in order to estimate the heritability. The selection
  allows us to reduce the size of the data sets which improves the accuracy of the
  estimations. Our package also provides a confidence interval for the estimated heritability.
