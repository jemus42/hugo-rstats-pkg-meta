title: Auxiliary functions for phenological data analysis
maintainer: Joerg Schaber
description: Provides some easy-to-use functions for time series<U+000a>analyses of
  (plant-) phenological data sets. These functions<U+000a>mainly deal with the estimation
  of combined phenological time<U+000a>series and are usually wrappers for functions
  that are already<U+000a>implemented in other R packages adapted to the special<U+000a>structure
  of phenological data and the needs of phenologists.<U+000a>Some date conversion
  functions to handle Julian dates are also<U+000a>provided.
