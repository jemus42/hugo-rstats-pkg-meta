title: Generic SQL Helper Functions for 'TSdbi' SQL Plugins
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Standard SQL query functions used by
  SQL plugins packages for the 'TSdbi' interface to time series databases.
  It will mainly be used by other packages rather than directly by end
  users. The one exception is the function 'TSquery' which can be used to
  construct a time series from a database containing observations over
  time (e.g. balance statements for multiple years), but where the database
  is not specifically designed to store time series (as with other
  'TSdbi' SQL plugin packages).
  Comprehensive examples of all the 'TS*' packages is provided in the
  vignette Guide.pdf with the 'TSdata' package.
