title: Analysis of Geostatistical Count Data using Gaussian Copulas
maintainer: Zifei Han
description: |-
  Provides a variety of functions to analyze and model
  geostatistical count data with Gaussian copulas, including
  1) data simulation and visualization;
  2) correlation structure assessment (here also known as the Normal To Anything);
  3) calculate multivariate normal rectangle probabilities;
  4) likelihood inference and parallel prediction at predictive locations.
