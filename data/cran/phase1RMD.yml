title: Repeated Measurement Design for Phase I Clinical Trial
maintainer: Jun Yin
description: Implements our Bayesian phase I repeated measurement design that accounts
  for multidimensional toxicity endpoints from multiple treatment cycles. The package
  also provides a novel design to account for both multidimensional toxicity endpoints
  and early-stage efficacy endpoints in the phase I design. For both designs, functions
  are provided to recommend the next dosage selection based on the data collected
  in the available patient cohorts and to simulate trial characteristics given design
  parameters. Yin, Jun, et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7134>.
