title: Direct Labels for Multicolor Plots
maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking
description: |-
  An extensible framework
  for automatically placing direct labels onto multicolor 'lattice' or
  'ggplot2' plots.
  Label positions are described using Positioning Methods
  which can be re-used across several different plots.
  There are heuristics for examining "trellis" and "ggplot" objects
  and inferring an appropriate Positioning Method.
