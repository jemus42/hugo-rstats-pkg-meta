  Insertion Deletion Analysis While Accounting for Possible
  Missing Data
maintainer: Utkarsh J. Dang
description: |-
  Genome-wide gene insertion and deletion rates can be modelled in a maximum
  likelihood framework with the additional flexibility of modelling potential missing
  data using the models included within. These models simultaneously estimate insertion
  and deletion (indel) rates of gene families and proportions of "missing" data for
  (multiple) taxa of interest. The likelihood framework is utilized for parameter
  estimation. A phylogenetic tree of the taxa and gene presence/absence patterns
  (with data ordered by the tips of the tree) are required. See Dang et al.
