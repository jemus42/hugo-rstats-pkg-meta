title: Person Parameter Estimation
maintainer: Jan Steinfeld
description: |-
  The PP package includes estimation of (MLE, WLE, MAP, EAP, ROBUST)
  person parameters for the 1,2,3,4-PL model and the GPCM (generalized
  partial credit model). The parameters are estimated under the assumption
  that the item parameters are known and fixed. The package is useful e.g. in
  the case that items from an item pool / item bank with known item parameters
  are administered to a new population of test-takers and an ability
  estimation for every test-taker is needed.
