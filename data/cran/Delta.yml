title: Measure of Agreement Between Two Raters
maintainer: Antonio Rodriguez
description: |-
  Measure of agreement delta was originally by Mart√≠n & Femia (2004) <DOI:10.1348/000711004849268>.
  Since then has been considered as agreement measure for different
  fields, since their behavior is usually better than the usual kappa index
  by Cohen (1960) <DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104>. The main issue with delta
  is that can not be computed by hand contrary to kappa. The current algorithm
  is based on the Version 5 of the delta windows program that can be found on
