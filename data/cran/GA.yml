description: Flexible general-purpose toolbox implementing genetic algorithms (GAs)
  for stochastic optimisation. Binary, real-valued, and permutation representations
  are available to optimize a fitness function, i.e. a function provided by users
  depending on their objective function. Several genetic operators are available and
  can be combined to explore the best settings for the current task. Furthermore,
  users can define new genetic operators and easily evaluate their performances. Local
  search using general-purpose optimisation algorithms can be applied stochastically
  to exploit interesting regions. GAs can be run sequentially or in parallel, using
  an explicit master-slave parallelisation or a coarse-grain islands approach.
