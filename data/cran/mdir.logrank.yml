title: Multiple-Direction Logrank Test
maintainer: Sarah Friedrich
description: |-
  Implemented are the one-sided and two-sided
  multiple-direction logrank test for two-sample right
  censored data. In addition to the statistics p-values are calculated:
  1. For the one-sided testing problem one p-value based on a
  wild bootstrap approach is determined. 2. In the two-sided case
  one p-value based on a chi-squared approximation and
  a second p-values based on a permutation approach are calculated.
