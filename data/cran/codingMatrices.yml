title: Alternative Factor Coding Matrices for Linear Model Formulae
maintainer: Bill Venables
description: |-
  A collection of coding functions as alternatives to the standard
  functions in the stats package, which have names starting with 'contr.'.  Their
  main advantage is that they provide a consistent method for defining marginal
  effects in factorial models.  In a simple one-way ANOVA model the
  intercept term is always the simple average of the class means.
