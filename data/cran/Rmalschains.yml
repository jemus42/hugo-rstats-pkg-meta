  Continuous Optimization using Memetic Algorithms with Local
  Search Chains (MA-LS-Chains) in R
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: |-
  An implementation of an algorithm family for continuous
  optimization called memetic algorithms with local search chains
  (MA-LS-Chains). Memetic algorithms are hybridizations of genetic
  algorithms with local search methods. They are especially suited
  for continuous optimization.
