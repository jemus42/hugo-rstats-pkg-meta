description: |-
  A collection of tools for performing the second step of
  Hermeneutic Content Analysis (HCA; see Bergman, 2010,
  <doi:10.4135/9781506335193>). The current version
  provides tools for implementing multidimensional scaling (MDS) within
  an HCA framework. The tools offer assistance in data preparation, modeling,
  and interpretation of MDS maps. The data preparation tools help
  users to create similarity matrices based on co-occurrence or sorting
  data. The modelling tools allow users to optimize the modelling process
  by systematically calculating Stress values for a set of p points out of n
  points. The tools assisting interpretation allow users to highlight the
  highest similarities either per point or overall in an MDS representation.
