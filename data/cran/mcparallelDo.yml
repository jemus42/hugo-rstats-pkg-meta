  A Simplified Interface for Running Commands on Parallel
  Processes
maintainer: Russell S. Pierce
description: |-
  Provides a function that wraps
  mcparallel() and mccollect() from 'parallel' with temporary variables and a
  task handler.  Wrapped in this way the results of an mcparallel() call
  can be returned to the R session when the fork is complete
  without explicitly issuing a specific mccollect() to retrieve the value.
  Outside of top-level tasks, multiple mcparallel() jobs can be retrieved with
  a single call to mcparallelDoCheck().
