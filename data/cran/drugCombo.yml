  Drug Interaction Modeling Based on Loewe Additivity Following
  Harbron's Approach
maintainer: Maxim Nazarov
description: |-
  Perform assessment of synergy/antagonism for drug combinations based
  on the Loewe additivity model, following Harbron's approach (Statistics in
  Medicine, 2010, <doi:10.1002/sim.3916>). The package allows flexible modeling
  of the drug interaction index and supports "2-stage" estimation in addition
  to "1-stage" estimation, including bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
  The method requires data on the monotherapy responses and the package
  accommodates both checkerboard and ray designs. Functions are available for
  graphical exploration of model goodness-of-fit and diagnostics, as well as
  for synergy/antagonism assessment in 2D and 3D.
