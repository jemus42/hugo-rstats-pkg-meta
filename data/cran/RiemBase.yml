title: Functions and C++ Header Files for Computation on Manifolds
maintainer: Kisung You
description: We provide a number of algorithms to estimate fundamental statistics
  including Fr√©chet mean and geometric median for manifold-valued data. Also, C++
  header files are contained that implement elementary operations on manifolds such
  as Sphere, Grassmann, and others. See Bhattacharya and Bhattacharya (2012) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139094764>
  if you are interested in statistics on manifolds, and Absil et al (2007, ISBN:9780691132983)
  on computational aspects of optimization on matrix manifolds.
