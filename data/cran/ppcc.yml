title: Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Test
maintainer: Thorsten Pohlert
description: |-
  Calculates the Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient (PPCC)
  between a continuous variable X and a specified distribution. The corresponding
  composite hypothesis test that was first introduced by
  Filliben (1975) <doi: 10.1080/00401706.1975.10489279>
  can be performed to test whether the sample
  X is element of either the Normal, log-Normal, Exponential,
  Uniform, Cauchy, Logistic, Generalized Logistic, Gumbel (GEVI), Weibull,
  Generalized Extreme Value, Pearson III (Gamma 2), Mielke's Kappa, Rayleigh
  or Generalized Logistic Distribution. The PPCC test is performed with
  a fast Monte-Carlo simulation.
