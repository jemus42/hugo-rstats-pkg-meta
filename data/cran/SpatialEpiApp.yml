  A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and
  Spatio-Temporal Disease Data
maintainer: Paula Moraga
description: Runs a Shiny web application that allows to visualize spatial and spatio-temporal
  disease data, estimate disease risk and detect clusters. The application allows
  to fit Bayesian disease models to obtain risk estimates and their uncertainty by
  using the 'R-INLA' package, <http://www.r-inla.org>, and to detect clusters by using
  the scan statistics implemented in 'SaTScan', <https://www.satscan.org>. The application
  allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations such as maps supporting
  padding and zooming and tables that allow for filtering. It also enables the generation
  of reports containing the analyses performed.
