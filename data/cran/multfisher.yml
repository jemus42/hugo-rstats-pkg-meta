title: Optimal Exact Tests for Multiple Binary Endpoints
maintainer: Robin Ristl
description: |-
  Calculates exact hypothesis tests to compare a treatment and a reference group with respect to multiple binary endpoints.
  The tested null hypothesis is an identical multidimensional distribution of successes and failures in both groups. The alternative
  hypothesis is a larger success proportion in the treatment group in at least one endpoint. The tests are based on the multivariate
  permutation distribution of subjects between the two groups. For this permutation distribution, rejection regions are calculated
  that satisfy one of different possible optimization criteria. In particular, regions with maximal exhaustion of the nominal
  significance level, maximal power under a specified alternative or maximal number of elements can be found. Optimization is achieved
  by a branch-and-bound algorithm. By application of the closed testing principle, the global hypothesis tests are extended to multiple
  testing procedures.
