title: Anti-Angiogenic Peptide Prediction
maintainer: Javad Zahiri
description: 'Machine learning based package to predict anti-angiogenic peptides using
  heterogeneous sequence descriptors. ''AntAngioCOOL'' exploits five descriptor types
  of a peptide of interest to do prediction including: pseudo amino acid composition,
  k-mer composition, k-mer composition (reduced alphabet), physico-chemical profile
  and atomic profile. According to the obtained results, ''AntAngioCOOL'' reached
  to a satisfactory performance in anti-angiogenic peptide prediction on a benchmark
  non-redundant independent test dataset.'
