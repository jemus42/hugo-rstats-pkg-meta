title: Testing for Symmetry of Data and Model Residuals
maintainer: Blagoje IvanoviÄ‡
description: |-
  Implementations of a large number of tests for symmetry and their
  bootstrap variants, which can be used for testing the symmetry of random
  samples around a known or unknown mean. Functions are also there for testing
  the symmetry of model residuals around zero. Currently, the supported models
  are linear models and generalized autoregressive conditional
  heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models (fitted with the 'fGarch' package). All
  tests are implemented using the 'Rcpp' package which ensures great
  performance of the code.
