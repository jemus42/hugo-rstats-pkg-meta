title: Transmissions and Receptions in an End to End Network
maintainer: Christian E. Galarza
description: Computes the expectation of the number of transmissions and receptions
  considering an End-to-End transport model with limited number of retransmissions
  per packet. It provides theoretical results and also estimated values based on Monte
  Carlo simulations. It is also possible to consider random data and ACK probabilities.
