title: Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
maintainer: Zhilong Jia
description: 'Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization aims to extend the Non-negative
  Matrix Factorization algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only
  the spatial locality, but also the separability between classes in a discriminant
  manner. It refers to three article, Zafeiriou, Stefanos, et al. "Exploiting discriminant
  information in nonnegative matrix factorization with application to frontal face
  verification." Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on 17.3 (2006): 683-695. Kim,
  Bo-Kyeong, and Soo-Young Lee. "Spectral Feature Extraction Using dNMF for Emotion
  Recognition in Vowel Sounds." Neural Information Processing. Springer Berlin Heidelberg,
  2013. and Lee, Soo-Young, Hyun-Ah Song, and Shun-ichi Amari. "A new discriminant
  NMF algorithm and its application to the extraction of subtle emotional differences
  in speech." Cognitive neurodynamics 6.6 (2012): 525-535.'
