description: |-
  A set of methods to implement Generalized Method of Moments and Maximal
  Likelihood methods for Random Utility Models. These methods are meant to
  provide inference on rank comparison data. These methods accept full,
  partial, and pairwise rankings, and provides methods to break down full or
  partial rankings into their pairwise components. Please see Generalized
  Method-of-Moments for Rank Aggregation from NIPS 2013 for a description of
  some of our methods.
