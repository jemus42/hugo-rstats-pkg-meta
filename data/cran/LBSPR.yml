title: Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio
maintainer: Adrian Hordyk
description: |-
  Simulate expected equilibrium length composition, yield-per-recruit, and
  the spawning potential ratio (SPR) using the length-based SPR (LBSPR) model. Fit the LBSPR
  model to length data to estimate  selectivity, relative apical fishing mortality, and
  the spawning potential ratio for data-limited fisheries.
  See Hordyk et al (2016) <doi:10.1139/cjfas-2015-0422> for more information about the
  LBSPR assessment method.
