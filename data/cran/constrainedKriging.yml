  Constrained, Covariance-Matching Constrained and Universal Point
  or Block Kriging
maintainer: Christoph Hofer
description: |-
  Provides functions for
  efficient computations of nonlinear spatial predictions with
  local change of support. This package supplies functions for
  tow-dimensional spatial interpolation by constrained,
  covariance-matching constrained and universal (external drift)
  kriging for points or block of any shape for data with a
  nonstationary mean function and an isotropic weakly stationary
  variogram. The linear spatial interpolation methods,
  constrained and covariance-matching constrained kriging,
  provide approximately unbiased prediction for nonlinear target
  values under change of support. This package
  extends the range of geostatistical tools available in R and
  provides a veritable alternative to conditional simulation for
  nonlinear spatial prediction problems with local change of
  support.
