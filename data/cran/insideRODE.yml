description: |-
  insideRODE package includes buildin functions from
  deSolve, compiled functions from compiler, and C/FORTRAN code
  interfaces to nlme. It includes nlmLSODA, nlmODE,
  nlmVODE,nlmLSODE for general purpose; cfLSODA,cfLSODE, cfODE,
  cfVODE call C/FORTRAN compiled dll functions.ver2.0 add
  sink()function into example it helps to directly combine
  c/fortran source code in R files. Finally, with new compiler
  package, we generated compiled functions: nlmODEcp, nlmVODEcp,
  nlmLSODEcp,nlmLSODAcp and cpODE, cpLSODA, cpLSODE, cpVODE. They
  will help to increase speed.
