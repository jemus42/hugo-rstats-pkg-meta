title: Clinical Trial Calculation Based on BCHM Design
maintainer: Nan Chen
description: Users can estimate the treatment effect for multiple subgroups basket
  trials based on the Bayesian Cluster Hierarchical Model (BCHM). In this model, a
  Bayesian non-parametric method is applied to dynamically calculate the number of
  clusters by conducting the multiple cluster classification based on subgroup outcomes.
  Hierarchical model is used to compute the posterior probability of treatment effect
  with the borrowing strength determined by the Bayesian non-parametric clustering
  and the similarities between subgroups. To use this package, 'JAGS' software and
  'rjags' package are required, and users need to pre-install them.
