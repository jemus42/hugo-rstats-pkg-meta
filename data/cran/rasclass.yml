title: Supervised Raster Image Classification
maintainer: Daniel Wiesmann
description: 'Software to perform supervised and pixel based raster image classification.
  It has been designed to facilitate land-cover analysis. Five classification algorithms
  can be used: Maximum Likelihood Classification, Multinomial Logistic Regression,
  Neural Networks, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. The output includes
  the classified raster and standard classification accuracy assessment such as the
  accuracy matrix, the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient. An option for in-sample
  verification is available.'
