title: Accessing and Processing a 'Mega2' Genetic Database
maintainer: Daniel E. Weeks
description: |-
  Uses as input genetic data that have been reformatted and
  stored in a 'SQLite' database; this database is initially created
  by the standalone 'mega2' C++ program (available freely from
  <https://watson.hgen.pitt.edu/register/>). Loads and manipulates
  data frames containing genotype, phenotype, and family
  information from the input 'SQLite' database, and decompresses
  needed subsets of the genotype data, on the fly, in a memory
  efficient manner.  We have also created several more functions
  that illustrate how to use the data frames as well as perform
  useful tasks: these permit one to run the 'pedgene' package to
  carry out gene-based association tests on family data using
  selected marker subsets, to run the 'SKAT' package to carry out
  gene-based association tests using selected marker subsets, to
  run the 'famSKATRC' package to carry out gene-based association
  tests on families (optionally) and with rare or common variants
  using selected marker subsets, to output the 'Mega2R' data as a
  VCF file and related files (for phenotype and family data), and
  to convert the data frames into CoreArray Genomic Data Structure
  (GDS) format.
