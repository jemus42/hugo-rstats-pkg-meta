title: Log-Multiplicative Models, Including Association Models
maintainer: Milan Bouchet-Valat
description: |-
  Functions to fit log-multiplicative models using 'gnm', with
  support for convenient printing, plots, and jackknife/bootstrap
  standard errors. For complex survey data, models can be fitted from
  design objects from the 'survey' package. Currently supported models
  include UNIDIFF (Erikson & Goldthorpe), a.k.a. log-multiplicative
  layer effect model (Xie), and several association models: Goodman's
  row-column association models of the RC(M) and RC(M)-L families
  with one or several dimensions; two skew-symmetric association
  models proposed by Yamaguchi and by van der Heijden & Mooijaart.
  Functions allow computing the intrinsic association coefficient
  (and therefore the Altham index), including via the Bayes shrinkage
  estimator proposed by Zhou; and the RAS/IPF/Deming-Stephan algorithm.
