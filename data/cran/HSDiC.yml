  Homogeneity and Sparsity Detection Incorporating Prior
  Constraint Information
maintainer: Yaguang Li
description: We explore sparsity and homogeneity of regression coefficients incorporating
  prior constraint information. A general pairwise fusion approach is proposed to
  deal with the sparsity and homogeneity detection when combining prior convex constraints.
  We develop an modified alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm (ADMM)
  to obtain the estimators.
