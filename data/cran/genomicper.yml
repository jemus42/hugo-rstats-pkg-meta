title: Circular Genomic Permutation using Gwas p-Values of Association
maintainer: Claudia Cabrera
description: 'Circular genomic permutation approach uses GWAS results to establish
  the significance of pathway/gene-set associations whilst accounting for genomic
  structure. All SNPs in the GWAS are placed in a ''circular genome'' according to
  their location. Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by
  rotation with respect to the SNPs'' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are
  available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The
  permutation at the gene level uses fisher''s combination test to calculate a single
  gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps
  each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real
  and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a
  matrix of GWAS association p-values. The SNPs annotation and pathways annotations
  can be performed within the package or provided by the user.'
