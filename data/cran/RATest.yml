version: 0.1.7
title: Randomization Tests
maintainer: Mauricio Olivares
description: A collection of randomization tests, data sets and examples. The current
  version focuses on three testing problems and their implementation in empirical
  work. First, it facilitates the empirical researcher to test for particular hypotheses,
  such as comparisons of means, medians, and variances from k populations using robust
  permutation tests, which asymptotic validity holds under very weak assumptions,
  while retaining the exact rejection probability in finite samples when the underlying
  distributions are identical. Second, the description and implementation of a permutation
  test for testing the continuity assumption of the baseline covariates in the sharp
  regression discontinuity design (RDD) as in Canay and Kamat (2017) <https://goo.gl/UZFqt7>.
  More specifically, it allows the user to select a set of covariates and test the
  aforementioned hypothesis using a permutation test based on the Cramer-von Miss
  test statistic. Graphical inspection of the empirical CDF and histograms for the
  variables of interest is also supported in the package. Third, it provides the practitioner
  with an effortless implementation of a permutation test based on the martingale
  decomposition of the empirical process for testing for heterogeneous treatment effects
  in the presence of an estimated nuisance parameter.
