title: R interface to Oracle Data Mining
maintainer: Pablo Tamayo
description: |-
  This package implements an interface to Oracle Data Mining
  (ODM). It provides an ideal environment for rapid development
  of demos and proof of concept data mining studies. It
  facilitates the prototyping of vertical applications and makes
  ODM and the RDBMS environment easily accessible to
  statisticians and data analysts familiar with R but not fluent
  in SQL or familiar with the database environment. It also
  facilitates the benchmarking and testing of ODM functionality
  including the production of summary statistics, performance
  metrics and graphics. It enables the scripting and control of
  production data mining methodologies from a high-level
  environment. Oracle Data Mining (ODM) is an option of Oracle
  Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) Enterprise
  Edition (EE). It contains several data mining and data analysis
  algorithms for classification, prediction, regression,
  clustering, associations, feature selection, anomaly detection,
  feature extraction, and specialized analytics. It provides
  means for the creation, management and operational deployment
  of data mining models inside the database environment. For more
  information consult the entry for "Oracle Data Mining" in
  Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org).
