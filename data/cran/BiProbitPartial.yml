title: Bivariate Probit with Partial Observability
maintainer: Michael Guggisberg
description: |-
  A suite of functions to estimate, summarize
  and perform predictions with the bivariate probit subject to partial observability.
  The frequentist and Bayesian probabilistic philosophies are both supported. The
  frequentist method is estimated with maximum likelihood and the Bayesian method is
  estimated with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm developed by
  Rajbanhdari, A (2014) <doi:10.1002/9781118771051.ch13>.
