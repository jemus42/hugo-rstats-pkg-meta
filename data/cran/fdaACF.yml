title: Autocorrelation Function for Functional Time Series
maintainer: Guillermo Mestre Marcos
description: |-
  Quantify the serial correlation across lags of a given functional
  time series using an autocorrelation function for functional time series.
  The autocorrelation function is based on the L2 norm of the lagged covariance
  operators of the series. Functions are available for estimating the
  distribution of the autocorrelation function under the assumption
  of strong functional white noise.
