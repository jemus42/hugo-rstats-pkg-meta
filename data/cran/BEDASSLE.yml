title: Quantifies effects of geo/eco distance on genetic<U+000a>differentiation
maintainer: Gideon Bradburd
description: provides functions that allow users to quantify the relative<U+000a>contributions
  of geographic and ecological distances to empirical patterns of genetic<U+000a>differentiation
  on a landscape.  Specifically, we use a custom Markov chain<U+000a>Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  algorithm, which is used to estimate the parameters of the<U+000a>inference model,
  as well as functions for performing MCMC diagnosis and assessing<U+000a>model adequacy.
