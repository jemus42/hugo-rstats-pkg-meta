title: Time Series Database Interface
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Provides a common interface to time series databases. The
  objective is to define a standard interface so users can retrieve time
  series data from various sources with a simple, common, set of
  commands, and so programs can be written to be portable with respect
  to the data source. The SQL implementations also provide a database
  table design, so users needing to set up a time series database
  have a reasonably complete way to do this easily. The interface
  provides for a variety of options with respect to the representation
  of time series in R. The interface, and the SQL implementations, also
  handle vintages of time series data (sometime called editions or
  real-time data). There is also a (not yet well tested) mechanism to
  handle multilingual data documentation.
  Comprehensive examples of all the 'TS*' packages is provided in the
  vignette Guide.pdf with the 'TSdata' package.
