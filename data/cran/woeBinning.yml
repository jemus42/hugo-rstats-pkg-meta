  Supervised Weight of Evidence Binning of Numeric Variables and
  Factors
maintainer: Thilo Eichenberg
description: |-
  Implements an automated binning of numeric variables and factors with
  respect to a dichotomous target variable.
  Two approaches are provided: An implementation of fine and coarse classing that
  merges granular classes and levels step by step. And a tree-like approach that
  iteratively segments the initial bins via binary splits. Both procedures merge,
  respectively split, bins based on similar weight of evidence (WOE) values and
  stop via an information value (IV) based criteria.
  The package can be used with single variables or an entire data frame. It provides
  flexible tools for exploring different binning solutions and for deploying them to
  (new) data.
