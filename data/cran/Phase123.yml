title: Simulating and Conducting Phase 123 Trials
maintainer: Andrew G Chapple
description: Contains three simulation functions for implementing the entire Phase
  123 trial and the separate Eff-Tox and Phase 3 portions of the trial, which may
  be beneficial for use on clusters. The functions AssignEffTox() and RandomizeEffTox()
  assign doses to patient cohorts during phase 12 and Reoptimize() determines the
  optimal dose to continue with during Phase 3. The functions ReturnMeansAgent() and
  ReturnMeanControl() gives the true mean survival for the agent doses and control
  and ReturnOCS() gives the operating characteristics of the design.
