title: Motif Analyses of Bipartite Networks
maintainer: Benno Simmons
description: |-
  Counts occurrences of motifs in bipartite networks, as well as the number of
  times each node or link appears in each unique position within motifs. Has support for both
  binary and weighted motifs: can calculate the mean weight of motifs and the standard deviation
  of their mean weights. Intended for use in ecology, but its methods are general and can be
  applied to any bipartite network.
