title: R Console Bindings for the 'Domino Command-Line Client'
maintainer: Nick Elprin
description: |-
  A wrapper on top of the 'Domino Command-Line Client'. It lets you
  run 'Domino' commands (e.g., "run", "upload", "download") directly from your
  R environment. Under the hood, it uses R's system function to run the 'Domino'
  executable, which must be installed as a prerequisite. 'Domino' is a service
  that makes it easy to run your code on scalable hardware, with integrated
  version control and collaboration features designed for analytical workflows
  (see <http://www.dominodatalab.com> for more information).
