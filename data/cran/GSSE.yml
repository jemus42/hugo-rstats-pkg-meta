title: Genotype-Specific Survival Estimation
maintainer: Baosheng Liang
description: We propose a fully efficient sieve maximum likelihood method to estimate
  genotype-specific distribution of time-to-event outcomes under a nonparametric model.
  We can handle missing genotypes in pedigrees.  We estimate the time-dependent hazard
  ratio between two genetic mutation groups using B-splines, while applying nonparametric
  maximum likelihood estimation to the reference baseline hazard function.  The estimators
  are calculated via an expectation-maximization algorithm.
