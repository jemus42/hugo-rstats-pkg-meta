version: '1.0'
title: Bayesian Augmented Control for Clinical Trials
maintainer: Hongtao Zhang
description: Implements the Bayesian Augmented Control (BAC, a.k.a. Bayesian historical
  data borrowing) method under clinical trial setting by calling 'Just Another Gibbs
  Sampler' ('JAGS') software. In addition, the 'BACCT' package evaluates user-specified
  decision rules by computing the type-I error/power, or probability of correct go/no-go
  decision at interim look. The evaluation can be presented numerically or graphically.
  Users need to have 'JAGS' 4.0.0 or newer installed due to a compatibility issue
  with 'rjags' package. Currently, the package implements the BAC method for binary
  outcome only. Support for continuous and survival endpoints will be added in future
  releases. We would like to thank AbbVie's Statistical Innovation group and Clinical
  Statistics group for their support in developing the 'BACCT' package.
