  Genome Scans to Accommodate and Target Genetic and Non-Genetic
  Effects on Trait Variance in Test Crosses
maintainer: Robert Corty
description: |-
  In recognition that there are many factors (genetic loci, macro-
  genetic factors such as sex, and environmental factors) that influence the
  extent of environmental variation, the 'vqtl' package conducts genome scans
  that accommodate and target these factors. The main functions of this package,
  scanonevar() and scanonevar.perm() take as input a cross object from the popular
  'qtl' package, as described in Corty and Valdar (2019) <doi:10.1534/g3.118.200642>.
