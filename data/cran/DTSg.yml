  A Class for Working with Time Series Based on 'data.table' and
  'R6' with Largely Optional Reference Semantics
maintainer: Gerold Hepp
description: |-
  Basic time series functionalities such as listing of missing
  values, application of arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling window
  functions and automatic detection of periodicity. As it is mainly based on
  'data.table', it is fast and - in combination with the 'R6' package - offers
  reference semantics. In addition to its native R6 interface, it provides an
  S3 interface inclusive an S3 wrapper method generator for those who prefer
  the latter.
