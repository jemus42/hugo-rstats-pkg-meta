title: Magnitude-Based Inferences
maintainer: Kyle Peterson
description: Allows practitioners and researchers a wholesale approach for deriving
  magnitude-based inferences from raw data. A major goal of 'mbir' is to programmatically
  detect appropriate statistical tests to run in lieu of relying on practitioners
  to determine correct stepwise procedures independently.
