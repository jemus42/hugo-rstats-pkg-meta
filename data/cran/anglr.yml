title: Mesh Topology and Visualization for Spatial Data
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Gives direct access to generic 3D tools and provides a full suite
  of mesh-creation and 3D plotting functions. By extending the 'rgl' package
  conversion and visualization functions for the 'mesh3d' class a wide variety of
  complex spatial data can be brought into 3D scenes. These tools allow for
  spatial raster, polygons, and lines that are common in 'GIS' contexts to be
  converted into mesh forms with high flexibility and the ability to integrate
  disparate data types. Vector and raster data can be seamlessly combined as
  meshes, and surfaces can be set to have material properties based on data
  values or with image textures. Textures and other data combinations use
  projection transformations to map between coordinate systems, and objects can
  be easily visualized in an interactive scene at any stage. This package relies
  on the 'RTriangle' package for high-quality triangular meshing which is
  licensed restrictively under 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0'.
