  Type-Specific Failure Rate and Hazard Rate on Competing Risks
  Data
maintainer: Chung-Hsing Chen
description: Given a failure type, the function computes covariate-specific probability
  of failure over time and covariate-specific conditional hazard rate based on possibly
  right-censored competing risk data. Specifically, it computes the non-parametric
  maximum-likelihood estimates of these quantities and their asymptotic variances
  in a semi-parametric mixture model for competing-risks data, as described in Chang
  et al. (2007a).
