title: Easy Analysis and Visualization of Factorial Experiments
maintainer: Michael A. Lawrence
description: |-
  Facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments, including
  purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a. "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss
  designs, and mixed within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package
  aim to provide simple, intuitive and consistent specification of data analysis
  and visualization. Visualization functions also include design visualization for
  pre-analysis data auditing, and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this
  package includes functions for non-parametric analysis, including permutation
  tests and bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap function obtains predictions
  either by cell means or by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding
  predictions and confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any level
  of the experiment's design.
