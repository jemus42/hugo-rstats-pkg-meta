title: Fuzzy Inference System Design and Optimization
maintainer: Jean-Luc Labl√©e
description: |-
  Fuzzy inference systems are based on fuzzy rules, which have a good capability for managing progressive phenomenons.
  This package is a basic implementation of the main functions to use a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) provided by the open source software 'FisPro' <https://www.fispro.org>.
  'FisPro' allows to create fuzzy inference systems and to use them for reasoning purposes, especially for simulating a physical or biological system.
