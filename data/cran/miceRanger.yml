title: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations with Random Forests
maintainer: Sam Wilson
description: |-
  Multiple Imputation has been shown to
  be a flexible method to impute missing values by
  Van Buuren (2007) <doi:10.1177/0962280206074463>.
  Expanding on this, random forests have been shown
  to be an accurate model by Stekhoven and Buhlmann
  <arXiv:1105.0828> to impute missing values in datasets.
  They have the added benefits of returning out of bag
  error and variable importance estimates, as well as
  being simple to run in parallel.
