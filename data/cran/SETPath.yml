title: Spiked Eigenvalue Test for Pathway data
maintainer: Patrick Danaher
description: Tests gene expression data from a biological pathway for biologically
  meaningful differences in the eigenstructure between two classes.  Specifically,
  it tests the null hypothesis that the two classes' leading eigenvalues and sums
  of eigenvalues are equal.  A pathway's leading eigenvalue arguably represents the
  total variability due to variability in pathway activity, while the sum of all its
  eigenvalues represents the variability due to pathway activity and to other, unregulated
  causes. Implementation of the method described in Danaher (2015), "Covariance-based
  analyses of biological pathways".
