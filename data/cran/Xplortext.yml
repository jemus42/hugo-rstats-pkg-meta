title: Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
maintainer: Ram√≥n Alvarez-Esteban
description: Provides a set of functions devoted to multivariate exploratory statistics
  on textual data. Classical methods such as correspondence analysis and agglomerative
  hierarchical clustering are available. Chronologically constrained agglomerative
  hierarchical clustering enriched with labelled-by-words trees is offered. Given
  a division of the corpus into parts, their characteristic words and documents are
  identified. Further, accessing to 'FactoMineR' functions is very easy. Two of them
  are relevant in textual domain. MFA() addresses multiple lexical table allowing
  applications such as dealing with multilingual corpora as well as simultaneously
  analyzing both open-ended and closed questions in surveys. See <http://www.xplortext.org>
  for examples.
