title: Read and Search Interface to the 'HL7 FHIR' REST API
maintainer: Sander Laverman
description: R on FHIR is an easy to use wrapper around the 'HL7 FHIR' REST API (STU
  3 and R4). It provides tools to easily read and search resources on a FHIR server
  and brings the results into the R environment. R on FHIR is based on the FhirClient
  of the official 'HL7 FHIR .NET API', also made by Firely.
