description: 'This is the central location for data and tools for the development,
  maintenance, analysis, and deployment of the International Soil Radiocarbon Database
  (ISRaD). ISRaD was developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey
  Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. This R package provides
  tools for accessing and manipulating ISRaD data, compiling local data using the
  ISRaD data structure, and simple query and reporting functions for ISRaD. For more
