title: Binomial Random Forest Feature Selection
maintainer: Samir Rachid Zaim
description: The 'binomialRF' is a new feature selection technique for decision trees
  that aims at providing an alternative approach to identify significant feature subsets
  using binomial distributional assumptions (Rachid Zaim, S., et al. (2019)) <doi:10.1101/681973>.
  Treating each splitting variable selection as a set of exchangeable correlated Bernoulli
  trials, 'binomialRF' then tests whether a feature is selected more often than by
  random chance.
