title: Hierarchical Derivative Curve Estimation
maintainer: Garritt L. Page
description: A procedure that fits derivative curves based on a sequence of quotient
  differences.  In a hierarchical setting the package produces estimates of subject-specific
  and group-specific derivative curves.  In a non-hierarchical setting the package
  produces a single derivative curve.
