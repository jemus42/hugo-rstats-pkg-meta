  Simulations and Statistical Inference for Linear Fractional
  Stable Motions
maintainer: Dmitry Otryakhin
description: Contains functions for simulating linear fractional stable motions, according
  to techniques developed by Stoev and Taqqu (2004) <doi:10.1142/S0218348X04002379>,
  as well as functions for computing important statistics used with these processes
  introduced by Mazur, Otryakhin and Podolskij (2018) <arXiv:1802.06373>, and also
  different quantities related to those statistics.
