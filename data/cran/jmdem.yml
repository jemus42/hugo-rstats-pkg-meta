title: Fitting Joint Mean and Dispersion Effects Models
maintainer: Ka Yui Karl Wu
description: Joint mean and dispersion effects models fit the mean and dispersion
  parameters of a response variable by two separate linear models, the mean and dispersion
  submodels, simultaneously. It also allows the users to choose either the deviance
  or the Pearson residuals as the response variable of the dispersion submodel. Furthermore,
  the package provides the possibility to nest the submodels in one another, if one
  of the parameters has significant explanatory power on the other. Wu & Li (2016)
