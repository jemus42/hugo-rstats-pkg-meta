title: Interface between HPCC and R
maintainer: Dinesh Shetye
description: |-
  rHpcc is an R package providing an Interface between R and
  HPCC.Familiarity with ECL (Enterprise Control Language) is a
  must to use this package.HPCC is a massive parallel-processing
  computing platform that solves Big Data problems.ECL is the
  Enterprise Control Language designed specifically for huge data
  projects using the HPCC platform.Its extreme scalability comes
  from a design that allows you to leverage every query you
  create for re-use in subsequent queries as needed. To do this,
  ECL takes a dictionary approach to building queries wherein
  each ECL definition defines an Attribute. Each previously
  defined Attribute can then be used in succeeding ECL Attribute
  definitions as the language extends itself as you use it.
