  Extensible Markov Model for Modelling Temporal Relationships
  Between Clusters
maintainer: Michael Hahsler
description: |-
  Implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships
  between Clusters for Data Streams), a generalization of
  Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order model
  to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting
  Markov Chain. Also provides an implementation of EMM (TRACDS on top of tNN
  data stream clustering). Development of this
  package was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893 and R21HG005912 from
  the National Human Genome Research Institute.
