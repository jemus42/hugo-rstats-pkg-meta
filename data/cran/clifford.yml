title: Arbitrary Dimensional Clifford Algebras
maintainer: Robin K. S. Hankin
description: |-
  A suite of routines for Clifford algebras, using the
  'Map' class of the Standard Template Library.  Canonical
  reference: Hestenes (1987, ISBN 90-277-1673-0, "Clifford algebra
  to geometric calculus").  Special cases including Lorentz transforms,
  quaternion multiplication, and Grassman algebra, are discussed.
  Conformal geometric algebra theory is implemented.
