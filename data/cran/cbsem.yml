  Simulation, Estimation and Segmentation of Composite Based
  Structural Equation Models
maintainer: Rainer Schlittgen
description: The composites are linear combinations of their indicators in composite
  based structural equation models. Structural models are considered consisting of
  two blocks. The indicators of the exogenous composites are named by X, the indicators
  of the endogenous by Y. Reflective relations are given by arrows pointing  from
  the composite to their indicators. Their values are called loadings.  In a reflective-reflective
  scenario all indicators have loadings. Arrows are pointing to their indicators only
  from the endogenous composites in  the formative-reflective scenario. There are
  no loadings at all in the formative-formative scenario. The covariance matrices
  are computed for these three scenarios. They can be used to simulate these models.
  These models can also be estimated and a segmentation procedure is included as well.
