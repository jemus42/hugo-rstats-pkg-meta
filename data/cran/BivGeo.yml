title: Basu-Dhar Bivariate Geometric Distribution
maintainer: Ricardo Puziol de Oliveira
description: Computes the joint probability mass function (pmf), the joint cumulative
  function (cdf), the joint survival function (sf), the correlation coefficient, the
  covariance, the cross-factorial moment and generate random deviates for the Basu-Dhar
  bivariate geometric distribution as well the joint probability mass, cumulative
  and survival function assuming the presence of a cure fraction given by the standard
  bivariate mixture cure fraction model. The package also computes the estimators
  based on the method of moments.
