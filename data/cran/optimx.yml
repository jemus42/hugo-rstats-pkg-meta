title: Expanded Replacement and Extension of the 'optim' Function
maintainer: John C Nash
description: |-
  Provides a replacement and extension of the optim()
  function to call to several function minimization codes in R in a single
  statement. These methods handle smooth, possibly box constrained functions
  of several or many parameters. Note that function 'optimr()' was prepared to
  simplify the incorporation of minimization codes going forward. Also implements some
  utility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded Newton methods.
  Many methods previously separate are now included here.
  This is the version for CRAN.
