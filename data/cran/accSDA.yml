version: 1.0.0
title: Accelerated Sparse Discriminant Analysis
maintainer: Gudmundur Einarsson
description: |-
  Implementation of sparse linear discriminant analysis, which is a supervised
  classification method for multiple classes. Various novel optimization approaches to
  this problem are implemented including alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
  proximal gradient (PG) and accelerated proximal gradient (APG) (See Atkins et al. <arXiv:1705.07194>).
  Functions for performing cross validation are also supplied along with basic prediction
  and plotting functions.
  Sparse zero variance discriminant analysis (SZVD) is also included in the package
  (See Ames and Hong, <arXiv:1401.5492>). See the github wiki for a more extended description.
