title: Geometrically Inspired Multivariate Changepoint Detection
maintainer: Thomas Grundy
description: 'Implements the high-dimensional changepoint detection method GeomCP
  and the related mappings used for changepoint detection. These methods view the
  changepoint problem from a geometrical viewpoint and aim to extract relevant geometrical
  features in order to detect changepoints. The geomcp() function should be your first
  point of call. References: Grundy et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11222-020-09940-y>.'
