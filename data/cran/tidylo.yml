title: Weighted Tidy Log Odds Ratio
maintainer: Julia Silge
description: |-
  How can we measure how the usage or frequency of some feature, such
  as words, differs across some group or set, such as documents? One option is
  to use the log odds ratio, but the log odds ratio alone does not account for
  sampling variability; we haven't counted every feature the same number of
  times so how do we know which differences are meaningful? Enter the weighted
  log odds, which 'tidylo' provides an implementation for, using tidy data
  principles. In particular, here we use the method outlined in Monroe,
  Colaresi, and Quinn (2008) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpn018> to weight the log odds
  ratio by a prior. By default, the prior is estimated from the data itself,
  an empirical Bayes approach, but an uninformative prior is also available.
