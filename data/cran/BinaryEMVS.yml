title: Variable Selection for Binary Data Using the EM Algorithm
maintainer: John Snyder
description: |-
  Implements variable selection for high dimensional datasets with a binary response
  variable using the EM algorithm.  Both probit and logit models are supported.  Also included
  is a useful function to generate high dimensional data with correlated variables.
