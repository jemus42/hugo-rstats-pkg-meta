title: Estimate the Population Size for the Mb Capture-Recapture Model
maintainer: John Snyder
description: Applies an objective Bayesian method to the Mb capture-recapture model
  to estimate the population size N.  The Mb model is a class of capture-recapture
  methods used to account for variations in capture probability due to animal behavior.  Under
  the Mb formulation,  the initial capture of an animal may effect the probability
  of subsequent captures due to their becoming "trap happy" or "trap shy."
