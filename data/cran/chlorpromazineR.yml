title: Convert Antipsychotic Doses to Chlorpromazine Equivalents
maintainer: Eric Brown
description: |-
  As different antipsychotic medications have different potencies,
  the doses of different medications cannot be directly compared. Various
  strategies are used to convert doses into a common reference so that
  comparison is meaningful. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) has historically been used
  as a reference medication into which other antipsychotic doses can be
  converted, as "chlorpromazine-equivalent doses". Using conversion keys
  generated from widely-cited scientific papers (Gardner et. al 2010
  <doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09060802>, Leucht et al. 2016
  <doi:10.1093/schbul/sbv167>), antipsychotic doses are converted
  to CPZ (or any specified antipsychotic) equivalents. The use of the package
  is described in the included vignette. Not for clinical use.
