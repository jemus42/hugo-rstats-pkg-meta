title: Raw Accelerometer Data Analysis
maintainer: Vincent T van Hees
description: 'A tool to process and analyse data collected with wearable raw acceleration
  sensors as described in Migueles and colleagues (2019) <doi: 10.1123/jmpb.2018-0063>,
  van Hees and colleagues (2014) <doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2014>, and (2015)
  <doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142533>. The package has been developed and tested for
  binary data from ''GENEActiv'' <https://www.activinsights.com/> and GENEA devices
  (not for sale), .csv-export data from  ''Actigraph'' <http://actigraphcorp.com>
  devices, and .cwa and .wav-format data from ''Axivity'' <https://axivity.com>. These
  devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity.
  Further, the package can handle accelerometer data file from any other sensor brand
  providing that the data is stored in csv format and has either no header or a two
  column header. Also the package allows for external function embedding.'
