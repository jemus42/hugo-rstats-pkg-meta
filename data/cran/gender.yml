title: Predict Gender from Names Using Historical Data
maintainer: Lincoln Mullen
description: |-
  Infers state-recorded gender categories from first names and dates of birth using historical
  datasets. By using these datasets instead of lists of male and female names,
  this package is able to more accurately infer the gender of a name, and it
  is able to report the probability that a name was male or female. GUIDELINES:
  This method must be used cautiously and responsibly. Please be sure to see the
  guidelines and warnings about usage in the 'README' or the package documentation.
  See Blevins and Mullen (2015) <http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000223/000223.html>.
