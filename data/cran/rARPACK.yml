title: Solvers for Large Scale Eigenvalue and SVD Problems
maintainer: Yixuan Qiu
description: |-
  Previously an R wrapper of the 'ARPACK' library
  <http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/>, and now a shell of the
  R package 'RSpectra', an R interface to the 'Spectra' library
  <http://yixuan.cos.name/spectra/> for solving large scale
  eigenvalue/vector problems. The current version of 'rARPACK'
  simply imports and exports the functions provided by 'RSpectra'.
  New users of 'rARPACK' are advised to switch to the 'RSpectra' package.
