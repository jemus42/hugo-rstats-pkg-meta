description: |-
  Utilities for fast and stable estimation of the probability of
  informed trading (PIN) in the model introduced by Easley et al. (2002)
  <DOI:10.1111/1540-6261.00493> are implemented. Since the basic model developed
  by Easley et al. (1996) <DOI:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb04074.x> is nested in the
  former due to equating the intensity of uninformed buys and sells, functions
  can also be applied to this simpler model structure, if needed.
  State-of-the-art factorization of the model likelihood function as well as
  most recent algorithms for generating initial values for optimization routines are implemented.
  In total, two likelihood factorizations and three methodologies for
  starting values are included.
  Furthermore, functions for simulating datasets of daily aggregated buys and sells,
  calculating confidence intervals for the probability of informed trading and posterior probabilities
  of trading days' conditions are available.
