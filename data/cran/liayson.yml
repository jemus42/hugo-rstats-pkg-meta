description: Given an RNA-seq derived cell-by-gene matrix and an DNA-seq derived copy
  number segmentation, LIAYSON predicts the number of clones present in a tumor, their
  size, the copy number profile of each clone and the clone membership of each single
  cell (Andor, N. & Lau, B., et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/445932>).
