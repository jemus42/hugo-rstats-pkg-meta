title: Build, Deploy and Evaluate Hybrid Ensembles
maintainer: Michel Ballings
description: 'Functions to build and deploy a hybrid ensemble consisting of eight
  different sub-ensembles: bagged logistic regressions, random forest, stochastic
  boosting, kernel factory, bagged neural networks, bagged support vector machines,
  rotation forest, and bagged k-nearest neighbors. Functions to cross-validate the
  hybrid ensemble and plot and summarize the results are also provided. There is also
  a function to assess the importance of the predictors.'
