title: A Pipeline to Define Gene Families in Legumes and Beyond
maintainer: Jose V. Die
description: |-
  A pipeline with high specificity and sensitivity in extracting
  proteins from the RefSeq database (National Center for Biotechnology
  Information). Manual identification of gene families is highly
  time-consuming and laborious, requiring an iterative process of manual and
  computational analysis to identify members of a given family. The pipelines
  implements an automatic approach for the identification of gene families
  based on the conserved domains that specifically define that family. See
  Die et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/436659> for more information and examples.
