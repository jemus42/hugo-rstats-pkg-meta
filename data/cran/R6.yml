title: Encapsulated Classes with Reference Semantics
maintainer: Winston Chang
description: |-
  Creates classes with reference semantics, similar to R's built-in
  reference classes. Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler
  and lighter-weight, and they are not built on S4 classes so they do not
  require the methods package. These classes allow public and private
  members, and they support inheritance, even when the classes are defined in
  different packages.
