title: Minimum Distance Estimation in Autoregressive Model
maintainer: Jiwoong Kim
description: Consider autoregressive model of order p where the distribution function
  of innovation is unknown, but innovations are independent and symmetrically distributed.
  The package contains a function named ARMDE which takes X (vector of n observations)
  and p (order of the model) as input argument and returns minimum distance estimator
  of the parameters in the model.
