title: A Modified Random Survival Forest Algorithm
maintainer: Hui Xu
description: Implements a modification to the Random Survival Forests algorithm for
  obtaining variable importance in high dimensional datasets. The proposed algorithm
  is appropriate for settings in which a silent event is observed through sequentially
  administered, error-prone self-reports or laboratory based diagnostic tests.  The
  modified algorithm incorporates a formal likelihood framework that accommodates
  sequentially administered, error-prone self-reports or laboratory based diagnostic
  tests. The original Random Survival Forests algorithm is modified by the introduction
  of a new splitting criterion based on a likelihood ratio test statistic.
