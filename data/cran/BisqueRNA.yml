title: Decomposition of Bulk Expression with Single-Cell Sequencing
maintainer: Brandon Jew
description: |-
  Provides tools to accurately estimate cell type abundances
  from heterogeneous bulk expression. A reference-based method utilizes
  single-cell information to generate a signature matrix and transformation
  of bulk expression for accurate regression based estimates. A marker-based
  method utilizes known cell-specific marker genes to measure relative
  abundances across samples.
