title: Baseline Correction of Spectra
maintainer: Kristian Hovde Liland
description: Collection of baseline correction algorithms, along with a framework
  and a Tcl/Tk enabled GUI for optimising baseline algorithm parameters. Typical use
  of the package is for removing background effects from spectra originating from
  various types of spectroscopy and spectrometry, possibly optimizing this with regard
  to regression or classification results. Correction methods include polynomial fitting,
  weighted local smoothers and many more.
