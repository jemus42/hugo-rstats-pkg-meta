description: Retrieval the leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (SM) from  microwave
  backscattering data using water cloud model (WCM) model . The WCM algorithm attributed
  to Pervot et al.(1993) <doi:10.1016/0034-4257(93)90053-Z>. The authors are grateful
  to SAC, ISRO, Ahmedabad for providing financial support to Dr. Prashant K Srivastava
  to conduct this research work.
