title: Simultaneous Tolerance Bounds
maintainer: Andre Schuetzenmeister
description: |-
  Provides an implementation of simultaneous tolerance bounds (STB), useful for checking whether a numeric vector fits to a hypothetical null-distribution or not.
  Furthermore, there are functions for computing STB (bands, intervals) for random variates of linear mixed models fitted with package 'VCA'. All kinds of, possibly transformed
  (studentized, standardized, Pearson-type transformed) random variates (residuals, random effects), can be assessed employing STB-methodology.
