title: Computational Methods for Immune Cell-Type Subsets
maintainer: Yael Steuerman
description: Provided are Computational methods for Immune Cell-type Subsets, including:(1)
  DCQ (Digital Cell Quantifier) to infer global dynamic changes in immune cell quantities
  within a complex tissue; and (2) VoCAL (Variation of Cell-type Abundance Loci) a
  deconvolution-based method that utilizes transcriptome data to infer the quantities
  of immune-cell types, and then uses these quantitative traits to uncover the underlying
  DNA loci.
