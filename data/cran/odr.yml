  Optimal Design and Statistical Power of Multilevel Randomized
  Trials
maintainer: Zuchao Shen
description: |-
  Calculate the optimal sample allocation that produces smallest variance of a
  treatment effect or the highest statistical power
  for experimental studies under a budget constraint,
  perform power analyses with and without accommodating cost structures of sampling, and calculate
  the relative efficiency between two sample allocations.
