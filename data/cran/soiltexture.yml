  Functions for Soil Texture Plot, Classification and
  Transformation
maintainer: Julien Moeys
description: '"The Soil Texture Wizard" is a set of R functions designed to produce
  texture triangles (also called texture plots, texture diagrams, texture ternary
  plots), classify and transform soil textures data. These functions virtually allows
  to plot any soil texture triangle (classification) into any triangle geometry (isosceles,
  right-angled triangles, etc.). This set of function is expected to be useful to
  people using soil textures data from different soil texture classification or different
  particle size systems. Many (> 15) texture triangles from all around the world are
  predefined in the package. A simple text based graphical user interface is provided:
  soiltexture_gui().'
