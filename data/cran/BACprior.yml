title: Choice of the Hyperparameter Omega in the Bayesian Adjustment<U+000a>for Confounding
  (BAC) Algorithm
maintainer: Denis Talbot
description: The BACprior package provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of
  the<U+000a>Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012)
  with regards to the<U+000a>hyperparameter omega. The package also provides functions
  to guide the user in their choice<U+000a>of an appropriate omega value. The method
  is based on Lefebvre, Atherton and Talbot (2014).
