description: Tools for multivariate data analysis. Several methods are provided for
  the analysis (i.e., ordination) of one-table (e.g., principal component analysis,
  correspondence analysis), two-table (e.g., coinertia analysis, redundancy analysis),
  three-table (e.g., RLQ analysis) and K-table (e.g., STATIS, multiple coinertia analysis).
  The philosophy of the package is described in Dray and Dufour (2007) <doi:10.18637/jss.v022.i04>.
