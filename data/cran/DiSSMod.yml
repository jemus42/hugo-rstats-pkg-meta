title: Fitting Sample Selection Models for Discrete Response Variables
maintainer: Sang Kyu Lee
description: |-
  Tools to fit sample selection models in case of discrete response
  variables, through a parametric formulation which represents a natural
  extension of the well-known Heckman selection model are provided in the
  package. The response variable can be of Bernoulli, Poisson or Negative
  Binomial type. The sample selection mechanism allows to choose among a
  Normal, Logistic or Gumbel distribution.
