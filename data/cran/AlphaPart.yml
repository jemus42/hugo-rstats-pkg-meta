  Information
maintainer: Jana Ob≈°teter
description: |-
  A software that implements a method for partitioning genetic trends to
  quantify the sources of genetic gain in breeding programmes.
  The partitioning method is described in Garcia-Cortes et al.
  (2008) <doi:10.1017/S175173110800205X>. The package includes the
  main function AlphaPart for partitioning breeding values and auxiliary
  functions for manipulating data and summarizing, visualizing, and saving
  results.
