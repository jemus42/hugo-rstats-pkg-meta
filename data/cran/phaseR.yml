  Phase Plane Analysis of One- And Two-Dimensional Autonomous ODE
  Systems
maintainer: Michael J Grayling
description: |-
  Performs a qualitative analysis of one- and two-dimensional
  autonomous ordinary differential equation systems, using phase plane methods.
  Programs are available to identify and classify equilibrium points, plot the
  direction field, and plot trajectories for multiple initial conditions. In
  the one-dimensional case, a program is also available to plot the phase
  portrait. Whilst in the two-dimensional case, programs are additionally
  available to plot nullclines and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle points.
  Many example systems are provided for the user. For further details can be
  found in Grayling (2014) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-023>.
