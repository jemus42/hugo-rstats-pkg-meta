title: Self Calibrating Quantile-Quantile Plots for Visual Testing
maintainer: Wayne Oldford
description: |-
  Provides the function qqtest which incorporates uncertainty in its
  qqplot display(s) so that the user might have a better sense of the
  evidence against the specified distributional hypothesis.  qqtest draws a
  quantile quantile plot for visually assessing whether the data come from a
  test distribution that has been defined in one of many ways.  The vertical
  axis plots the data quantiles, the horizontal those of a test distribution.
  The default behaviour generates 1000 samples from the test distribution and
  overlays the plot with shaded pointwise interval estimates for the ordered
  quantiles from the test distribution.  A small number of independently
  generated exemplar quantile plots can also be overlaid.  Both the interval
  estimates and the exemplars provide different comparative information to
  assess the evidence provided by the qqplot for or against the hypothesis
  that the data come from the test distribution (default is normal or
  gaussian).  Finally, a visual test of significance (a lineup plot) can also
  be displayed to test the null hypothesis that the data come from the test
  distribution.
