title: Identification and Estimation using Group Testing
maintainer: Brianna Hitt
description: |-
  Methods for the group testing identification problem: 1) Operating
  characteristics (e.g., expected number of tests) for commonly used
  hierarchical and array-based algorithms, and 2) Optimal testing
  configurations for these same algorithms. Calculations for algorithms with
  single-disease assays are described in Hitt et al. (2019)
  <doi:10.1002/sim.8341> and with multiplex assays are described in Bilder
  et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/biom.12988> and Hou et al. (2020)
  <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy058>. Methods for the group testing
  estimation problem: 1) Estimation and inference procedures for an overall
  prevalence, and 2) Regression modeling for commonly used hierarchical and
  array-based algorithms. Estimation and confidence interval methods are
  described in Biggerstaff (2008) <doi:10.1198/108571108X379055> and
  Hepworth & Biggerstaff (2017) <doi:10.1007/s13253-017-0297-2>.
  Regression modeling is described in Xie (2001) <doi:10.1002/sim.817>.
