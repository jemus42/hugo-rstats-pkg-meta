title: Matching Algorithms in R and C++
maintainer: Jan Tilly
description: |-
  Computes matching algorithms quickly using Rcpp.
  Implements the Gale-Shapley Algorithm to compute the stable
  matching for two-sided markets, such as the stable marriage
  problem and the college-admissions problem. Implements Irving's
  Algorithm for the stable roommate problem. Implements the top
