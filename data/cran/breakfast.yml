version: 1.0.0
title: Multiple Change-Point Detection and Segmentation
maintainer: Piotr Fryzlewicz
description: |-
  The breakfast package performs multiple change-point detection in data
  sequences, or sequence segmentation, using computationally efficient multiscale
  methods. This version of the package implements the "Tail-Greedy Unbalanced Haar",
  "Wild Binary Segmentation" and "Adaptive Wild Binary Segmentation" change-point
  detection and segmentation methodologies. To start with, see the function
  segment.mean.
