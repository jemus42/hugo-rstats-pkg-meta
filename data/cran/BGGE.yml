title: Bayesian Genomic Linear Models Applied to GE Genome Selection
maintainer: Italo Granato
description: |-
  Application of genome prediction for a continuous variable, focused
  on genotype by environment (GE) genomic selection models (GS). It consists a group of functions
  that help to create regression kernels for some GE genomic models proposed by Jarqu√≠n et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00122-013-2243-1>
  and Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.016097>. Also, it computes genomic predictions based on Bayesian approaches.
  The prediction function uses an orthogonal transformation of the data and specific priors
  present by Cuevas et al. (2014) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.013094>.
