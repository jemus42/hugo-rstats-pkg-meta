title: CCDr Algorithm for Learning Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Networks
maintainer: Bryon Aragam
description: Implementation of the CCDr (Concave penalized Coordinate Descent with
  reparametrization) structure learning algorithm as described in Aragam and Zhou
  (2015) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/aragam15a.html>. This is a fast, score-based
  method for learning Bayesian networks that uses sparse regularization and block-cyclic
  coordinate descent.
