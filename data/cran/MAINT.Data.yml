title: Model and Analyse Interval Data
maintainer: Pedro Duarte Silva
description: |-
  Implements methodologies for modelling interval data by Normal
  and Skew-Normal distributions, considering appropriate parameterizations of
  the variance-covariance matrix that takes into account the intrinsic nature of
  interval data, and lead to four different possible configuration structures.
  The Skew-Normal parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood, while Normal
  parameters may be estimated by maximum likelihood or robust trimmed maximum
  likelihood methods.
