title: Estimation in Adaptive Group Sequential Trials
maintainer: Matthias Brueckner
description: |-
  Calculation of repeated confidence intervals as well as confidence
  intervals based on the stage-wise ordering in group sequential designs and
  adaptive group sequential designs. For adaptive group sequential designs
  the confidence intervals are based on the conditional rejection probability
  principle. Currently the procedures do not support the use of futility
  boundaries or more than one adaptive interim analysis.
