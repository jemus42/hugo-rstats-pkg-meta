title: Model-Free Covariate Selection in High Dimensions
maintainer: Jenny Häggström
description: Model-free selection of covariates in high dimensions under unconfoundedness
  for situations where the parameter of interest is an average causal effect. This
  package is based on  model-free backward elimination algorithms proposed in de Luna,
  Waernbaum and Richardson (2011) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asr041> and VanderWeele and
  Shpitser (2011) <DOI:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01619.x>. Confounder selection can
  be performed via either Markov/Bayesian networks, random forests or LASSO.
