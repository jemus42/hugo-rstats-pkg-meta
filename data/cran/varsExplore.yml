title: Searchable Variable Explorer with Labelled Variables
maintainer: Vlad Tarko
description: |-
  Creates a summary dataframe that can be used in 'RStudio' similar to the variable
  explorer in 'Stata', but which also includes the summary statistics. By default the result
  is shown in the 'RStudio' Viewer Pane as a searchable data table. This is useful particularly
  if you have a large dataset with a very large number of labelled variables with hard to
  remember names. Can also be used to generate a table of summary statistics.
