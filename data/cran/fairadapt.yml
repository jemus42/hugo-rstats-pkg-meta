maintainer: Drago Plecko
description: |-
  An implementation of the fair data adaptation with quantile preservation described in
  Plecko & Meinshausen (2019) <arXiv:1911.06685>.
  The adaptation procedure uses the specified causal graph to pre-process the
  given training and testing data in such a way to remove the bias caused by
  the protected attribute. The procedure uses tree ensembles for quantile
  regression.
