title: Cox Models with Dynamic Ridge Penalties
maintainer: Aris Perperoglou
description: A package for fitting Cox models with penalized ridge-type partial likelihood.
  The package includes functions for fitting simple Cox models with all covariates
  controlled by a ridge penalty. The weight of the penalty is optimised by using a
  REML type-algorithm. Models with time varying effects of the covariates can also
  be fitted. Some of the covariates may be allowed to be fixed and thus not controlled
  by the penalty. There are three different penalty functions, ridge, dynamic and
  weighted dynamic. Time varying effects can be fitted without the need of an expanded
  dataset.
