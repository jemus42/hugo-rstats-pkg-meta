title: Various Methods for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension
maintainer: Hideitsu Hino
description: |-
  An implementation of various methods for estimating intrinsic
  dimension of vector-valued dataset or distance matrix. Most methods implemented
  are based on different notion of fractal dimension such as the capacity
  dimension, the box-counting dimension, and the information dimension.
