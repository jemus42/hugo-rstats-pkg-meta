title: Computation of v Values for U and Copula C(U, v)
maintainer: Josef Brejcha
description: |-
  Computation the value of one of two uniformly
  distributed marginals if the copula probability value is known
  and the value of the second marginal is also known.
  Computation and plotting corresponding cumulative
  distribution function or survival function.
  The numerical definition of a common area limited by lines
  of the cumulative distribution function and survival function.
  Approximate quantification of the probability of this area.
  In addition to 'amh', the copula dimension may be larger than 2.
