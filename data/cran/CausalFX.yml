title: Methods for Estimating Causal Effects from Observational Data
maintainer: Ricardo Silva
description: |-
  Estimate causal effects of one variable on another, currently for
  binary data only. Methods include instrumental variable bounds, adjustment by a
  given covariate set, adjustment by an induced covariate set using a variation of
  the PC algorithm, and an effect bounding method (the Witness Protection Program)
  based on covariate adjustment with observable independence constraints.
