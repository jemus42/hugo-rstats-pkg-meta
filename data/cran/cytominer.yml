title: Methods for Image-Based Cell Profiling
maintainer: Shantanu Singh
description: |-
  Typical morphological profiling datasets have millions of cells
  and hundreds of features per cell. When working with this data, you must
  clean the data, normalize the features to make them comparable across
  experiments, transform the features, select features based on their
  quality, and aggregate the single-cell data, if needed. 'cytominer' makes
  these steps fast and easy. Methods used in practice in the field are
  discussed in Caicedo (2017) <doi:10.1038/nmeth.4397>. An overview of the
  field is presented in Caicedo (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2016.04.003>.
