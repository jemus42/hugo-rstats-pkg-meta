maintainer: Henrique Jose de Paula Alves
description: 'This is a statistical tool interactive that provides multivariate statistical
  tests that are more powerful than traditional Hotelling T2 test and LRT (likelihood
  ratio test) for the vector of normal mean populations with and without contamination
  and non-normal populations (Henrique J. P. Alves & Daniel F. Ferreira (2019) <DOI:
  10.1080/03610918.2019.1693596>).'
