description: |-
  There are two functions-meta2d and meta3d for
  detecting rhythmic signals from time-series datasets. For analyzing
  time-series datasets without individual information, 'meta2d' is
  suggested, which could incorporates multiple methods from ARSER,
  JTK_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle in the detection of interested rhythms. For
  analyzing time-series datasets with individual information, 'meta3d' is
  suggested, which takes use of any one of these three methods to analyze
  time-series data individual by individual and gives out integrated values
  based on analysis result of each individual.
