title: Set of Common Tools for Forecast Verification
maintainer: An-Chi Ho
description: |-
  Set of tools to verify forecasts through the computation of typical
  prediction scores against one or more observational datasets or reanalyses (a
  reanalysis being a physical extrapolation of observations that relies on the
  equations from a model, not a pure observational dataset). Intended for seasonal
  to decadal climate forecasts although can be useful to verify other kinds of
  forecasts. The package can be helpful in climate sciences for other purposes
  than forecasting.
