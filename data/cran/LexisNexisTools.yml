title: Working with Files from 'LexisNexis'
maintainer: Johannes Gruber
description: |-
  My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper
  analysis starts by writing code to read in files from the 'LexisNexis' newspaper
  archive (retrieved e.g., from <http://www.nexis.com/> or any of the partner
  sites). However, while this is a nice exercise I do recommend, not everyone has
  the time. This package takes TXT files downloaded from the newspaper archive of
  'LexisNexis', reads them into R and offers functions for further processing.
