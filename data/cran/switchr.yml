  Installing, Managing, and Switching Between Distinct Sets of
  Installed Packages
maintainer: Gabriel Becker
description: |-
  Provides an abstraction for managing, installing,
  and switching between sets of installed R packages. This allows users to
  maintain multiple package libraries simultaneously, e.g. to maintain
  strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses, or
  work within a development/production release paradigm. Introduces a
  generalized package installation process which supports multiple repository
  and non-repository sources and tracks package provenance.
