title: Species Sensitivity Distributions
maintainer: Joe Thorley
description: |-
  Species sensitivity distributions are
  cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to
  toxicity concentrations for different species as described by
  Posthuma et al.(2001) <isbn:9781566705783>.
  The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions
  such as the log-normal, gamma, burr Type-III, log-logistic,
  log-Gumbel, Gompertz and Weibull.
  The user can provide custom distributions.
  Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
  Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations and proportions are produced by
  parametric bootstrapping.
