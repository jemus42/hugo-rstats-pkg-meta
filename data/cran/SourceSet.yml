  A Graphical Model Approach to Identify Primary Genes in
  Perturbed Biological Pathways
maintainer: Elisa Salviato
description: The algorithm pursues the identification of the set of variables driving
  the differences in two different experimental conditions (i.e., the primary genes)
  within a graphical model context. It uses the idea of simultaneously looking for
  the differences between two multivariate normal distributions in all marginal and
  conditional distributions associated with a decomposable graph, which represents
  the pathway under exam. The implementation accommodates genomics specific issues
  (low sample size and multiple testing issues) and provides a number of functions
  offering numerical and visual summaries to help the user interpret the obtained
  results. In order to use the (optional) 'Cytoscape' functionalities, the suggested
  'r2cytoscape' package must be installed from the 'GitHub' repository ('devtools::install_github('cytoscape/r2cytoscape')').
