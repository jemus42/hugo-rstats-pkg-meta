  A Tool for Automating Download and Preprocessing of MODIS Land
  Products Data
maintainer: Lorenzo Busetto
description: |-
  Allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived
  from MODIS Satellite Land Products data. It performs several typical
  preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojection and resize
  of data acquired on a specified time period. All processing parameters
  can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users can select which layers of
  the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, which additional
  Quality Indicators should be extracted from aggregated MODIS Quality
  Assurance layers and, in the case of Surface Reflectance products
  , which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the original reflectance
  bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster
  files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files
  allowing access to the entire time series as a single file are also created.
  Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options
  file is also possible, allowing to automatically update time series
  related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.
