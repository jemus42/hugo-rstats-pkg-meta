version: '4.2'
title: Stable Isotope Analysis in R
maintainer: Andrew Parnell
description: |-
  This package takes data on organism isotopes and fits a
  Bayesian model to their dietary habits based upon a Gaussian
  likelihood with a mixture dirichlet-distributed prior on the
  mean. It also includes SiBER metrics. See siardemo() for an
  example. Version 4.1.2 contains bug fixes to allow more than
  isotope numbers other than 2. Version 4.2 fixes a bug that
  stopped siar working on 64-bit systems
