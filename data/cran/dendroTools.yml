  Linear and Nonlinear Methods for Analyzing Daily and Monthly
  Dendroclimatological Data
maintainer: Jernej Jevsenak
description: |-
  Provides novel dendroclimatological methods, primarily used by the
  Tree-ring research community. There are four core functions. The first one is
  daily_response(), which finds the optimal sequence of days that are related
  to one or more tree-ring proxy records. Similar function is daily_response_seascorr(),
  which implements partial correlations in the analysis of daily response functions.
  For the enthusiast of monthly data, there is monthly_response() function.
  The last core function is compare_methods(), which effectively compares several
  linear and nonlinear regression algorithms on the task of climate reconstruction.
