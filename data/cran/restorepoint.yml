title: Debugging with Restore Points
maintainer: Roman Zenka
description: |-
  Debugging with restore points instead of break points. A restore
  point stores all local variables when called inside a function. The stored
  values can later be retrieved and evaluated in a modified R console that
  replicates the function's environment. To debug step by step, one can simply
  copy & paste the function body from the R script. Particularly convenient
  in combination with "RStudio". See the "Github" page inst/vignettes for a
  tutorial.
