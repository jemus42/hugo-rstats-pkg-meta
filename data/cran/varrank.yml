  Heuristics Tools Based on Mutual Information for Variable
  Ranking
maintainer: Gilles Kratzer
description: A computational toolbox of heuristics approaches for performing variable
  ranking and feature selection based on mutual information well adapted for multivariate
  system epidemiology datasets. The core function is a general implementation of the
  minimum redundancy maximum relevance model. R. Battiti (1994) <doi:10.1109/72.298224>.
  Continuous variables are discretized using a large choice of rule. Variables ranking
  can be learned with a sequential forward/backward search algorithm. The two main
  problems that can be addressed by this package is the selection of the most representative
  variable within a group of variables of interest (i.e. dimension reduction) and
  variable ranking with respect to a set of features of interest.
