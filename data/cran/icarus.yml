version: 0.3.1
title: Calibrates and Reweights Units in Samples
maintainer: Antoine Rebecq
description: |-
  Provides user-friendly tools for calibration in survey sampling.
  The package is production-oriented, and its interface is inspired by the famous
  popular macro 'Calmar' for SAS, so that 'Calmar' users can quickly get used to
  'icarus'. In addition to calibration (with linear, raking and logit methods),
  'icarus' features functions for calibration on tight bounds and penalized
  calibration.
