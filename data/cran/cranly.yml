title: Package Directives and Collaboration Networks in CRAN
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: Core visualizations and summaries for the CRAN package database. The
  package provides comprehensive methods for cleaning up and organizing the information
  in the CRAN package database, for building package directives networks (depends,
  imports, suggests, enhances, linking to) and collaboration networks, producing package
  dependence trees, and for computing useful summaries and producing interactive visualizations
  from the resulting networks and summaries. The resulting networks can be coerced
  to 'igraph' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph> objects for further analyses
  and modelling.
