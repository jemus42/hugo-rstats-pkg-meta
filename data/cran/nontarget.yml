title: Detecting Isotope, Adduct and Homologue Relations in LC-MS Data
maintainer: Martin Loos
description: Screening a HRMS data set for peaks related by (1) isotope patterns,
  (2) different adducts of the same molecule and/or (3) homologue series. The resulting
  isotopic pattern and adduct groups can then be combined to so-called components,
  with homologue series information attached. Also allows plotting and filtering HRMS
  data for mass defects, frequent m/z distances and components vs. non-components.
