title: Basic wavelet analysis of multivariate time series with a<U+000a>visualisation
  and parametrisation using graph theory.
maintainer: Sophie Achard
description: This package computes the correlation matrix for each<U+000a>scale of
  a wavelet decomposition, namely the one performed by<U+000a>the R package waveslim
  (Whitcher, 2000). An hypothesis test is<U+000a>applied to each entry of one matrix
  in order to construct an<U+000a>adjacency matrix of a graph. The graph obtained
  is finally<U+000a>analysed using the small-world theory (Watts and Strogatz,<U+000a>1998)
  and using the computation of efficiency (Latora, 2001),<U+000a>tested using simulated
  attacks. The brainwaver project is<U+000a>complementary to the camba project for
  brain-data<U+000a>preprocessing. A collection of scripts (with a makefile) is<U+000a>avalaible
  to download along with the brainwaver package, see<U+000a>information on the webpage
  mentioned below.
