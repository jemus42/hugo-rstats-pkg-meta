title: Estimating Finite State Machine Models from Data
maintainer: Gilligan Jonathan M.
description: |-
  Automatic generation of finite state machine models of dynamic
  decision-making that both have strong predictive power and are
  interpretable in human terms. We use an efficient model representation and
  a genetic algorithm-based estimation process to generate simple
  deterministic approximations that explain most of the structure of complex
  stochastic processes. We have applied the software to empirical data, and
  demonstrated it's ability to recover known data-generating processes by
  simulating data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the
  underlying decision models for multiple agent models and degrees of
  stochasticity.
