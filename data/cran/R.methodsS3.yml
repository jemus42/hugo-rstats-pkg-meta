title: S3 Methods Simplified
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods.  Major
  effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as possible with
  a minimum of maintenance for package developers.  For example, generic functions
  are created automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically solved,
  if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future
  may want to migrate to S4.  This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure
  R that generates standard S3 methods.
