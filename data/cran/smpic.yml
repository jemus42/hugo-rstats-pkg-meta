title: Creates Images Sized for Social Media
maintainer: Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm
description: |-
  Creates images that are the proper size for social media. Beautiful
  plots, charts and graphs wither and die if they are not shared. Social media
  is perfect for this but every platform has its own image dimensions. With
  'smpic' you can easily save your plots with the exact dimensions needed for
  the different platforms.
