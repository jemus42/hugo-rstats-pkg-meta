title: Set Data Visualization Using Hierarchies
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  Pure set data visualization approaches are often limited in
  scalability due to the combinatorial explosion of distinct set families as
  the number of sets under investigation increases. hierarchicalSets applies
  a set centric hierarchical clustering of the sets under investigation and
  uses this hierarchy as a basis for a range of scalable visual
  representations. hierarchicalSets is especially well suited for collections
  of sets that describe comparable comparable entities as it relies on the
  sets to have a meaningful relational structure.
