maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Build a map of path-based geometry, this is a simple description of the number
  of parts in an object and their basic structure. Translation and restructuring operations for
  planar shapes and other hierarchical types require a data model with a record of the underlying
  relationships between elements. The gibble() function creates a geometry map, a simple record of
  the underlying structure in path-based hierarchical types. There are methods for the planar shape
  types in the 'sf' and 'sp' packages and for types in the 'trip' and 'silicate' packages.
