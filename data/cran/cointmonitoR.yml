  Consistent Monitoring of Stationarity and Cointegrating
  Relationships
maintainer: Philipp Aschersleben
description: |-
  We propose a consistent monitoring procedure to detect a
  structural change from a cointegrating relationship to a spurious
  relationship. The procedure is based on residuals from modified least
  squares estimation, using either Fully Modified, Dynamic or Integrated
  Modified OLS. It is inspired by Chu et al. (1996) <DOI:10.2307/2171955> in
  that it is based on parameter estimation on a pre-break "calibration" period
  only, rather than being based on sequential estimation over the full sample.
  See the discussion paper <DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2624657> for further information.
  This package provides the monitoring procedures for both the cointegration
  and the stationarity case (while the latter is just a special case of the
  former one) as well as printing and plotting methods for a clear
  presentation of the results.
