  An implementation of the algorithm described in "Efficient Large-
  Scale Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising"
  by Paulson, Luo, and James (Journal of Marketing Research 2018; see URL below
  for journal text/citation and <http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/Research/ELMSO.pdf>
  for a full-text version of the paper). The algorithm here is designed to
  allocate budget across a set of online advertising opportunities using a
  coordinate-descent approach, but it can be used in any resource-allocation
  problem with a matrix of visitation (in the case of the paper, website page-
  views) and channels (in the paper, websites). The package contains allocation
  functions both in the presence of bidding, when allocation is dependent on
  channel-specific cost curves, and when advertising costs are fixed at each channel.
