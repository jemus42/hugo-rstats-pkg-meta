title: Multivariate Dependence with Copulas
maintainer: Martin Maechler
description: |-
  Classes (S4) of commonly used elliptical, Archimedean,
  extreme-value and other copula families, as well as their rotations,
  mixtures and asymmetrizations. Nested Archimedean copulas, related
  tools and special functions. Methods for density, distribution, random
  number generation, bivariate dependence measures, Rosenblatt transform,
  Kendall distribution function, perspective and contour plots. Fitting of
  copula models with potentially partly fixed parameters, including
  standard errors. Serial independence tests, copula specification tests
  (independence, exchangeability, radial symmetry, extreme-value
  dependence, goodness-of-fit) and model selection based on
  cross-validation. Empirical copula, smoothed versions, and
  non-parametric estimators of the Pickands dependence function.
