title: Airborne LiDAR Filtering Method Based on Cloth Simulation
maintainer: Jean-Romain Roussel
description: |-
  Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) is an airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) ground
  points filtering algorithm  which is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate the interactions
  between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be
  determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/6/501/htm>.
