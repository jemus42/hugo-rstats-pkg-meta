  Environmental health studies are increasingly measuring multiple pollutants
  to characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure mixtures.
  However, the underlying dose-response relationship between toxicants and
  health outcomes of interest may be highly nonlinear, with possible nonlinear
  interaction effects. Hierarchical integrative group least absolute shrinkage
  and selection operator (HiGLASSO), developed by Boss et al (2020)
  <arXiv:2003.12844>, is a general framework to identify noteworthy nonlinear
  main and interaction effects in the presence of group structures among a set
  of exposures.
