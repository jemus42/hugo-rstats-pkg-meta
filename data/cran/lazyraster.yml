title: Generate Raster Data Lazily from 'GDAL'
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Read raster data at a specified resolution on-demand via 'GDAL'
  (the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library <https://gdal.org/>). Augments the
  'raster' package by never reading data from a raster source until necessary for
  generating an in-memory 'raster' object. A 'lazyraster' object may be cropped
  and converted to 'raster' object, and by default will only read a small amount
  of data sufficient for an overall summary. The amount of data read can be
  controlled by specifying the output dimensions.
