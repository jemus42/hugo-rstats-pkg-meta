  Bayesian Model Optimized Reference Correction Method for
  Assigned and Unassigned Protein NMR Spectra
maintainer: Xi Chen
description: Provides reference correction for protein NMR spectra. Bayesian Model
  Optimized Reference Correction (BaMORC) is utilizing Bayesian probabilistic framework
  to perform protein NMR referencing correction, currently for alpha and beta carbon-13
  chemical shifts, without any resonance assignment and/or three-dimensional protein
  structure. For more detailed explanation, please refer to the paper "Automatic 13C
  Chemical Shift Reference Correction for Unassigned Protein NMR Spectra" <https://rdcu.be/4ly5>
  (Journal of Biomolecular NMR, Aug 2018)" <doi:10.1007/s10858-018-0202-5>.
