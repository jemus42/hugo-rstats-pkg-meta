  Study Design and Data Analysis in the Presence of Error-Prone
  Diagnostic Tests and Self-Reported Outcomes
maintainer: Xiangdong Gu
description: |-
  We consider studies in which information from error-prone
  diagnostic tests or self-reports are gathered sequentially to determine the
  occurrence of a silent event. Using a likelihood-based approach
  incorporating the proportional hazards assumption, we provide functions to
  estimate the survival distribution and covariate effects. We also provide
  functions for power and sample size calculations for this setting.
