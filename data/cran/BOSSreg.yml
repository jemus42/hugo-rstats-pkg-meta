title: Best Orthogonalized Subset Selection (BOSS)
maintainer: Sen Tian
description: 'Best orthogonalized subset selection (BOSS) is a least-squares (LS)
  based subset selection method, that performs best subset selection upon an orthogonalized
  basis of ordered predictors, with the computational effort of a single ordinary
  LS fit. This package provides a highly optimized implementation of BOSS and estimates
  a heuristic degrees of freedom for BOSS, which can be plugged into an information
  criterion (IC) such as AICc in order to select the subset from candidates. It provides
  various choices of IC, including AIC, BIC, AICc, Cp and GCV. It also implements
  the forward stepwise selection (FS) with no additional computational cost, where
  the subset of FS is selected via cross-validation (CV). CV is also an option for
  BOSS. For details see: Tian, Hurvich and Simonoff (2019), "On the Use of Information
  Criteria for Subset Selection in Least Squares Regression", <arXiv:1911.10191>.'
