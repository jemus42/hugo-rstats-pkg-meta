title: Streamlined Plot Theme and Plot Annotations for 'ggplot2'
maintainer: Claus O. Wilke
description: |2-

  Provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures
  with 'ggplot2', such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange
  them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate
  plots and or mix plots with images. The package was originally written for
  internal use in the Wilke lab, hence the name (Claus O. Wilke's plot package).
  It has also been used extensively in the book Fundamentals of Data
  Visualization.
