description: |-
  Various tools for microeconomic analysis and microeconomic modelling,
  e.g. estimating quadratic, Cobb-Douglas and Translog functions,
  calculating partial derivatives and elasticities of these functions,
  and calculating Hessian matrices, checking curvature
  and preparing restrictions for imposing monotonicity of Translog functions.
