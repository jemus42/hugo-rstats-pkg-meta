description: 'Tools for creating and visualizing statistical process control charts.
  Control charts are used for monitoring measurement processes, such as those occurring
  in manufacturing.  The objective is to monitor the history of such processes and
  flag outlying measurements: out-of-control signals.  Montgomery, D. (2009, ISBN:978-0-470-16992-6)
  contains an extensive discussion of the methodology.'
