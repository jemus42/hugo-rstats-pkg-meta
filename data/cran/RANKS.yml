title: Ranking of Nodes with Kernelized Score Functions
maintainer: Giorgio Valentini
description: Implementation of Kernelized score functions and other semi-supervised
  learning algorithms for node label ranking in biomolecular networks. RANKS can be
  easily applied to a large set of different relevant problems in computational biology,
  ranging from automatic protein function prediction, to gene disease prioritization
  and drug repositioning, and more in general to any bioinformatics problem that can
  be formalized as a node label ranking problem in a graph. The modular nature of
  the implementation allows to experiment with different score functions and kernels
  and to easily compare the results with baseline network-based methods such as label
  propagation and random walk algorithms, as well as to enlarge the algorithmic scheme
  by adding novel user-defined score functions and kernels.
