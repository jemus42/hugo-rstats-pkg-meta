title: Spatial Interpolation of Genetic Data
maintainer: Pedro Tarroso
description: |-
  The spatial interpolation of genetic distances between
  samples is based on a modified kriging method that
  accepts a genetic distance matrix and generates a map of
  probability of lineage presence. This package also offers
  tools to generate a map of  potential contact zones
  between groups with user-defined thresholds in the tree
  to account for old and recent divergence. Additionally,
  it has functions for IDW interpolation using genetic data
  and midpoints.
