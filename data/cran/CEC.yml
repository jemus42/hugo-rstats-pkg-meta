maintainer: Konrad Kamieniecki
description: CEC divides data into Gaussian type clusters. The implementation allows
  the simultaneous use of various type Gaussian mixture models, performs the reduction
  of unnecessary clusters and it's able to discover new groups. Based on Spurek, P.
  and Tabor, J. (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2014.03.006>.
