  A Flexible Container to Transport and Manipulate Data and
  Associated Resources
maintainer: Matthew B. Jones
description: |-
  Provides a flexible container to transport and manipulate complex
  sets of data. These data may consist of multiple data files and associated
  meta data and ancillary files. Individual data objects have associated system
  level meta data, and data files are linked together using the OAI-ORE standard
  resource map which describes the relationships between the files. The OAI-
  ORE standard is described at <https://www.openarchives.org/ore>. Data packages
  can be serialized and transported as structured files that have been created
  following the BagIt specification. The BagIt specification is described at
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-08>.
