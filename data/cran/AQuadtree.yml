title: Confidentiality of Spatial Point Data
maintainer: Raymond Lagonigro
description: |-
  Provides an automatic aggregation tool to manage point data privacy,
  intended to be helpful for the production of official spatial data and for researchers.
  The package pursues the data accuracy at the smallest possible areas preventing
  individual information disclosure. The methodology, based on hierarchical geographic
  data structures performs aggregation and local suppression of point data to ensure privacy
  as described in Lagonigro, R., Oller, R., Martori J.C. (2017) <doi:10.2436/20.8080.02.55>.
  The data structures are created following the guidelines for grid datasets from the
  European Forum for Geography and Statistics.
