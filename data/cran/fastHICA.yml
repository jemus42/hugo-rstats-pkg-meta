  Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis: a Multi-Scale
  Sparse Non-Orthogonal Data-Driven Basis
maintainer: Paolo Zanini
description: It implements HICA (Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis) algorithm.
  This approach, obtained through the integration between treelets and Independent
  Component Analysis, is able to provide a multi-scale non-orthogonal data-driven
  basis, whose elements have a phenomenological interpretation according to the problem
  under study.
