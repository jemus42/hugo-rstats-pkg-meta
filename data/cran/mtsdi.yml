title: Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation
maintainer: Washington Junger
description: This is an EM algorithm based method for imputation of missing values
  in multivariate normal time series. The imputation algorithm accounts for both spatial
  and temporal correlation structures. Temporal patterns can be modeled using an ARIMA(p,d,q),
  optionally with seasonal components, a non-parametric cubic spline or generalized
  additive models with exogenous covariates. This algorithm is specially tailored
  for climate data with missing measurements from several monitors along a given region.
