description: |2-

  Analyse species-habitat associations in R. Therefore, information about the
  location of the species is needed and about the environmental conditions. To test
  for significance habitat associations, one of the two components is randomized.
  Methods are mainly based on Plotkin et al. (2000) <doi:10.1006/jtbi.2000.2158> and
  Harms et al. (2001) <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2745.2001.00615.x>.
