title: Simulate and Evaluate Time Series for Environmental Epidemiology
maintainer: Brooke Anderson
description: |-
  Provides functions to create simulated time series of environmental
  exposures (e.g., temperature, air pollution) and health outcomes for use in
  power analysis and simulation studies in environmental epidemiology. This
  package also provides functions to evaluate the results of simulation studies
  based on these simulated time series. This work was supported by a grant
  from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R00ES022631) and
  a fellowship from the Colorado State University Programs for Research and
  Scholarly Excellence.
