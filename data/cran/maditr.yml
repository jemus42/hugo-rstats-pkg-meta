  Fast Data Aggregation, Modification, and Filtering with Pipes
  and 'data.table'
maintainer: Gregory Demin
description: |-
  Package provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'. It preserves all 'data.table' features without
  significant impact on performance. 'let' and 'take' functions are simplified interfaces for most common data
  manipulation tasks. For example, you can write 'take(mtcars, mean(mpg), by = am)' for aggregation or
  'let(mtcars, hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use 'take_if/let_if' for conditional
  aggregation/modification. 'query_if' function translates its arguments one-to-one to '[.data.table' method.
  Additionally there are some conveniences such as automatic 'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
