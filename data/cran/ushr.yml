title: Understanding Suppression of HIV
maintainer: Sinead E. Morris
description: Analyzes longitudinal data of HIV decline in patients on antiretroviral
  therapy using the canonical biphasic exponential decay model (pioneered, for example,
  by work in Perelson et al. (1997) <doi:10.1038/387188a0>; and Wu and Ding (1999)
  <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00410.x>). Model fitting and parameter estimation
  are performed, with additional options to calculate the time to viral suppression.
  Plotting and summary tools are also provided for fast assessment of model results.
