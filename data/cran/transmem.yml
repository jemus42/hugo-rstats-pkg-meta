title: Treatment of Membrane-Transport Data
maintainer: Cristhian Paredes
description: |-
  Treatment and visualization of membrane (selective) transport
  data. Transport profiles involving up to three species are produced as
  publication-ready plots and several membrane performance parameters
  (e.g. separation factors as defined in Koros et al. (1996)
  <doi:10.1351/pac199668071479> and non-linear regression parameters
  for the equations described in Rodriguez de San Miguel et al. (2014)
  <doi:10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.03.052>) can be obtained. Many widely used
  experimental setups (e.g. membrane physical aging) can be easily studied
  through the package's graphical representations.
