  A Pipeline to Analyze Resistance and Tolerance from Drug Disk
  Diffusion Assays
maintainer: Aleeza Gerstein
description: A pipeline to analyze photographs of disk diffusion plates. This removes
  the need to analyze the plates themselves, and thus analysis can be done separate
  from the assay. Furthermore, diskImageR removes potential researcher bias, by quantitative
  assessment of drug resistance as the zone diameter at multiple cutoff values of
  growth inhibition. This method also extends the disk diffusion assay by measuring
  drug tolerance (in addition to drug resistance) as the fraction of the subpopulation
  that is able to grow above the resistance point ("FoG"), and drug sensitivity as
  the rate of change from no growth to full growth ("slope").
