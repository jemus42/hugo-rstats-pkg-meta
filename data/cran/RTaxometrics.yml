title: Taxometric Analysis
maintainer: John Ruscio
description: We provide functions to perform taxometric analyses. This package contains
  44 functions, but only 5 should be called directly by users. CheckData() should
  be run prior to any taxometric analysis to ensure that the data are appropriate
  for taxometric analysis. RunTaxometrics() performs taxometric analyses for a sample
  of data. RunCCFIProfile() performs a series of taxometric analyses to generate a
  CCFI profile. CreateData() generates a sample of categorical or dimensional data.
  ClassifyCases() assigns cases to groups using the base-rate classification method.
