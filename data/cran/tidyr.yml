version: 1.1.0
title: Tidy Messy Data
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: |-
  Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a
  variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value.
  'tidyr' contains tools for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy
  (nesting and 'unnesting') of a dataset, turning deeply nested lists
  into rectangular data frames ('rectangling'), and extracting values out
  of string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values
  (both implicit and explicit).
