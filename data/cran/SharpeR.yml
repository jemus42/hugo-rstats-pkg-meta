maintainer: Steven E. Pav
description: |-
  A collection of tools for analyzing significance of assets,
  funds, and trading strategies, based on the Sharpe ratio and overfit
  of the same. Provides density, distribution, quantile and random generation
  of the Sharpe ratio distribution based on normal returns, as well
  as the optimal Sharpe ratio over multiple assets. Computes confidence intervals
  on the Sharpe and provides a test of equality of Sharpe ratios based on
  the Delta method. The statistical foundations of the Sharpe can be found in
  the author's Short Sharpe Course  <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3036276>.
