title: Number of Newly Discovered Rare Species Estimation
maintainer: Youhua Chen
description: |-
  A Bayesian-weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators are
  developed to estimate the number of newly found rare species in additional
  ecological samples. Among these methods, the Bayesian-weighted estimator
  and an unweighted (Chao-derived) estimator are of high accuracy and
  recommended for practical applications.
  Technical details of the proposed estimators have been well described
  in the following paper: Shen TJ, Chen YH (2018) A Bayesian
  weighted approach to predicting the number of newly discovered
  rare species. Conservation Biology, In press.
