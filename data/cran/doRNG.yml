title: Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for 'foreach' Loops
maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux
description: |-
  Provides functions to perform
  reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent
  random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined
  multiple-recursive generator [L'Ecuyer (1999), <DOI:10.1287/opre.47.1.159>].
  It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops into
  fully reproducible loops, independently of the number
  of workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen
  parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
