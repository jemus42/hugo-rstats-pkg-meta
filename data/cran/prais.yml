title: Prais-Winsten Estimator for AR(1) Serial Correlation
maintainer: Franz X. Mohr
description: The Prais-Winsten estimator (Prais & Winsten, 1954) takes into account
  AR(1) serial correlation of the errors in a linear regression model. The procedure
  recursively estimates the coefficients and the error autocorrelation of the specified
  model until sufficient convergence of the AR(1) coefficient is attained.
