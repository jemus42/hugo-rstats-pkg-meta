title: Indoor Positioning Fingerprinting Toolset
maintainer: Emilio Sansano
description: |-
  Algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning using fingerprinting techniques.
  These functions are designed for manipulation of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Intensity) data
  sets, estimation of positions,comparison of the performance of different models, and graphical
  visualization of data. Machine learning algorithms and methods such as k-nearest neighbors or
  probabilistic fingerprinting are implemented in this package to perform analysis
  and estimations over RSSI data sets.
