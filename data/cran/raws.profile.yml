title: Managing Profiles on Amazon Web Service
maintainer: Samuel Macedo
description: |-
  This is an R wrapper from the AWS Command Line Interface that
  provides methods to manage the user configuration on Amazon Web Service. You
  can create as many profiles as you want, manage them, and delete them. The
  profiles created with this tool work with all AWS products such as S3,
  Glacier, and EC2. It also provides a function to automatically install
  AWS CLI, but you can download it and install it manually if you prefer.
