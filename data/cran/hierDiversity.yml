title: Hierarchical Multiplicative Partitioning of Complex Phenotypes
maintainer: Zachary Marion
description: |-
  Hierarchical group-wise partitioning of phenotypic diversity into
  within-group (alpha), among-group (beta), and pooled-total (gamma)
  components using Hill numbers.
  Turnover and overlap are also calculated as standardized alternatives to
  beta diversity. Hierarchical bootstrapping is used to approximate
  uncertainty around each diversity component.
