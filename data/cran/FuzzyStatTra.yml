title: Statistical Methods for Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers
maintainer: Asun Lubiano
description: |-
  The aim of the package is to provide some basic functions
  for doing statistics with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In particular,
  the package contains several functions for simulating trapezoidal
  fuzzy numbers, as well as for calculating some central tendency
  measures (mean and two types of median), some scale measures
  (variance, ADD, MDD, Sn, Qn, Tn and some M-estimators) and
  one diversity index and one inequality index. Moreover,
  functions for calculating the 1-norm distance, the mid/spr
  distance and the (phi,theta)-wabl/ldev/rdev distance between
  fuzzy numbers are included, and a function to calculate the
  value phi-wabl given a sample of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.
