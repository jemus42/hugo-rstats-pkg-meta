  Robust Bayesian Variable Selection for Gene-Environment
  Interactions
maintainer: Jie Ren
description: |-
  Gene-environment (G×E) interactions have important implications to elucidate the
  etiology of complex diseases beyond the main genetic and environmental effects.
  Outliers and data contamination in disease phenotypes of G×E studies have been commonly
  encountered, leading to the development of a broad spectrum of robust penalization methods.
  Nevertheless, within the Bayesian framework, the issue has not been taken care of in existing
  studies. We develop a robust Bayesian variable selection method for G×E interaction
  studies. The proposed Bayesian method can effectively accommodate heavy-tailed errors and
  outliers in the response variable while conducting variable selection by accounting for
  structural sparsity. In particular, the spike-and-slab priors have been imposed on both
  individual and group levels to identify important main and interaction effects. An efficient
  Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate fast computation. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
  algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are efficiently implemented in C++.
