version: 0.1.0
title: Isolate Functions for Remote Execution
maintainer: Lionel Henry
description: |-
  Sending functions to remote processes can be wasteful of
  resources because they carry their environments with them. With
  the carrier package, it is easy to create functions that are
  isolated from their environment. These isolated functions, also
  called crates, print at the console with their total size and can
  be easily tested locally before being sent to a remote.
