title: Unbiased Central Moment Estimates
maintainer: Inna Gerlovina
description: |-
  Calculates one-sample unbiased central moment estimates and
  two-sample pooled estimates up to 6th order, including estimates of
  powers and products of central moments. Provides the machinery for
  obtaining unbiased central moment estimators beyond 6th order by generating
  expressions for expectations of raw sample moments and their powers and
  products.
