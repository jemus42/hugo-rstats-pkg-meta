title: A Simple and Flexible Switch-Case Construct for the 'R' Language
maintainer: Joachim Zuckarelli
description: Provides a switch-case construct for 'R', as it is known from other programming
  languages. It allows to test multiple, similar conditions in an efficient, easy-to-read
  manner, so nested if-else constructs can be avoided. The switch-case construct is
  designed as an 'R' function that allows to return values depending on which condition
  is met and lets the programmer flexibly decide whether or not to leave the switch-case
  construct after a case block has been executed.
