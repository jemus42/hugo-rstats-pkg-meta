title: Fits the Bayesian Piecewise Linear Log-Hazard Model
maintainer: Andrew G Chapple
description: Contains posterior samplers for the Bayesian piecewise linear log-hazard
  and piecewise exponential hazard models, including Cox models. Posterior mean restricted
  survival times are also computed for non-Cox an Cox models with only treatment indicators.
  The ApproxMean() function can be used to estimate restricted posterior mean survival
  times given a vector of patient covariates in the Cox model. Functions included
  to return the posterior mean hazard and survival functions for the piecewise exponential
  and piecewise linear log-hazard models. Chapple, AG, Peak, T, Hemal, A (2020). Under
  Revision.
