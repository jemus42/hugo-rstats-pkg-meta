title: Multinomial Logit Model
maintainer: Asad Hasan
description: Time and memory efficient estimation of multinomial logit models using
  maximum likelihood method. Numerical optimization performed by Newton-Raphson method
  using an optimized, parallel C++ library to achieve fast computation of Hessian
  matrices. Motivated by large scale multiclass classification problems in econometrics
  and machine learning.
