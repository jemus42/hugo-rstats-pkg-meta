title: Multivariate Ordered Probit Model via Pairwise Likelihood
maintainer: Euloge Clovis Kenne Pagui
description: Multivariate ordered probit model, i.e. the extension of the scalar ordered
  probit model where the observed variables have dimension greater than one. Estimation
  of the parameters is done via maximization of the pairwise likelihood, a special
  case of the composite likelihood obtained as product of bivariate marginal distributions.
  The package uses the Fortran 77 subroutine SADMVN by Alan Genz, with minor adaptations
  made by Adelchi Azzalini in his "mvnormt" package for evaluating the two-dimensional
  Gaussian integrals involved in the pairwise log-likelihood. Optimization of the
  latter objective function  is performed via quasi-Newton box-constrained optimization
  algorithm, as implemented in nlminb.
