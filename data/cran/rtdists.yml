  Provides response time distributions (density/PDF,
  distribution function/CDF, quantile function, and random
  generation): (a) Ratcliff diffusion model (Ratcliff &
  McKoon, 2008, <doi:10.1162/neco.2008.12-06-420>) based on C
  code by Andreas and Jochen Voss and (b) linear ballistic
  accumulator (LBA; Brown & Heathcote, 2008,
  <doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002>) with different
  distributions underlying the drift rate.
