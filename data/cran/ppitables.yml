  Lookup Tables to Generate Poverty Likelihoods and Rates using
  the Poverty Probability Index (PPI)
maintainer: Ernest Guevarra
description: |-
  The Poverty Probability Index (PPI) is a poverty measurement tool
  for organizations and businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI
  is statistically-sound, yet simple to use: the answers to 10 questions about
  a household’s characteristics and asset ownership are scored to compute the
  likelihood that the household is living below the poverty line – or above by
  only a narrow margin. This package contains country-specific lookup data tables
  used as reference to determine the poverty likelihood of a household based
  on their score from the country-specific PPI questionnaire. These lookup
  tables have been extracted from documentation of the PPI found at
  <https://www.povertyindex.org> and managed by Innovations for Poverty Action
  <https://www.poverty-action.org>.
