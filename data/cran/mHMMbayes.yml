title: Multilevel Hidden Markov Models Using Bayesian Estimation
maintainer: Emmeke Aarts
description: |-
  An implementation of the multilevel (also known as mixed or random
  effects) hidden Markov model using Bayesian estimation in R. The multilevel
  hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the well-known hidden
  Markov model, for the latter see Rabiner (1989) <doi:10.1109/5.18626>. The
  multilevel HMM is tailored to accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of
  multiple individuals simultaneously, see e.g., de Haan-Rietdijk et al.
  <doi:10.1080/00273171.2017.1370364>. Using a multilevel framework, we allow
  for heterogeneity in the model parameters (transition probability matrix and
  conditional distribution), while estimating one overall HMM. The model can
  be fitted on multivariate data with a categorical distribution, and include
  individual level covariates (allowing for e.g., group comparisons on model
  parameters). Parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing
  the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs
  sampler. The package also includes various visualization options, a function
  to simulate data, and a function to obtain the most likely hidden state
  sequence for each individual using the Viterbi algorithm.
