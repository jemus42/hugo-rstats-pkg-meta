maintainer: Jake Anderson
description: Reads data files from the 'Gem infrasound logger' for analysis and converts
  to segy format (which is convenient for reading with traditional seismic analysis
  software). The Gem infrasound logger is a low-cost, lightweight, low-power instrument
  for recording infrasound in field campaigns; email the maintainer for more information.
