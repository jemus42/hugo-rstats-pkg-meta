title: Statistical Process Control for Stochastic Textured Surfaces
maintainer: Anh Bui
description: |-
  Provides statistical process control tools for stochastic
  textured surfaces. The current version supports the following tools:
  (1) generic modeling of stochastic textured surfaces.
  (2) local defect monitoring and diagnostics in stochastic
  textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018a)
  <doi:10.1080/00401706.2017.1302362>.
  (3) global change monitoring in the nature of stochastic
  textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018b)
  <doi:10.1080/00224065.2018.1507559>.
  (4) computation of dissimilarity matrix of stochastic textured
  surface images, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2019b)
  <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2019.01.019>.
