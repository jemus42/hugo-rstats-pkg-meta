  Computation of Generalized Linear Models with Misclassified
  Covariates Using Side Information
maintainer: Stephan Dlugosz
description: |-
  Estimates models that extend the standard GLM to take
  misclassification into account. The models require side information from a secondary data set
  on the misclassification process, i.e. some sort of misclassification
  probabilities conditional on some common covariates.
  A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in
  Dlugosz, Mammen and Wilke (2015) <http://www.zew.de/PU70410>.
