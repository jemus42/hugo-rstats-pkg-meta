title: American Politics-Inspired Color Palette Generator
maintainer: Philip Waggoner
description: |-
  A color palette generator inspired by American politics, with colors ranging from blue on the
  left to gray in the middle and red on the right. A variety of palettes allow for a range of applications
  from brief discrete scales (e.g., three colors for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) to
  continuous interpolated arrays including dozens of shades graded from blue (left) to red (right). This
  package greatly benefitted from building on the source code (with permission) from Ram and Wickham (2015).
