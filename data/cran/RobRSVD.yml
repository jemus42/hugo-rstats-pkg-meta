title: Robust Regularized Singular Value Decomposition
maintainer: Lingsong Zhang
description: This package provides the function to calculate SVD, regularized SVD,
  robust SVD and robust regularized SVD method. The robust SVD methods use alternating
  iteratively reweighted least squares methods. The regularized SVD uses generalized
  cross validation to choose the optimal smoothing parameters.
