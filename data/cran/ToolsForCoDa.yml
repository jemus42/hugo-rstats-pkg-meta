title: Multivariate Tools for Compositional Data Analysis
maintainer: Jan Graffelman
description: Provides functions for multivariate analysis with compositional data.
  Includes a function for doing compositional canonical correlation analysis. This
  analysis requires two data matrices of compositions, which can be adequately transformed
  and used as entries in a specialized program for canonical correlation analysis,
  that is able to deal with singular covariance matrices. The methodology is described
  in Graffelman et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/144584>.
