version: 0.5.1
title: An R Front End for 'ACER ConQuest'
maintainer: Dan Cloney
description: |2-

  Extends 'ACER ConQuest' by allowing R users to call 'ACER ConQuest' from within R.
  Users can also read 'ACER ConQuest' System Files (generated by the command 'put').
  This is of particular use to those who are parsing text file output (e.g., 'show' files) as this is not consistent across releases of 'ACER ConQuest'.
  Requires 'ACER ConQuest' version 4.34.0 or later. A demonstration version can be downloaded from <https://shop.acer.edu.au/acer-conquest-4>.
