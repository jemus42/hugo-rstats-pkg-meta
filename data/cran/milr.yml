title: Multiple-Instance Logistic Regression with LASSO Penalty
maintainer: Ping-Yang Chen
description: |-
  The multiple instance data set consists of many independent
  subjects (called bags) and each subject is composed of several components
  (called instances). The outcomes of such data set are binary or categorical responses,
  and, we can only observe the subject-level outcomes. For example, in manufacturing
  processes, a subject is labeled as "defective" if at least one of its own
  components is defective, and otherwise, is labeled as "non-defective". The
  'milr' package focuses on the predictive model for the multiple instance
  data set with binary outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation
  with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm under the framework of logistic
  regression. Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to the likelihood function
  for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection.
