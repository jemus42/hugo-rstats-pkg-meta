title: Simulate Survival Data
maintainer: Sam Brilleman
description: |-
  Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival
  distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture
  distributions, or a user-defined hazard, log hazard, cumulative hazard,
  or log cumulative hazard function. Baseline covariates can be included
  under a proportional hazards assumption.
  Time dependent effects (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be included by
  interacting covariates with linear time or a user-defined function of time.
  Clustered event times are also accommodated.
  The 2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible
  baseline hazard functions reflecting those seen in practice.
  If the user wishes to provide a user-defined
  hazard or log hazard function then this is possible, and the resulting
  cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution.
  Note that this package is modelled on the 'survsim' package available in
  the 'Stata' software (see Crowther and Lambert (2012)
  <http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0275> or
  Crowther and Lambert (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5823>).
