title: Time-Ordered and Time-Aggregated Network Analyses
maintainer: Benjamin Blonder
description: 'Approaches for incorporating time into network analysis. Methods include:
  construction of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs); shortest-time and shortest-path-length
  analyses; resource spread calculations; data resampling and rarefaction for null
  model construction; reduction to time-aggregated networks with variable window sizes;
  application of common descriptive statistics to these networks; vector clock latencies;
  and plotting functionalities. The package supports <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020298>.'
