title: Algorithmic Complexity for Short Strings
maintainer: Henrik Singmann
description: 'Main functionality is to provide the algorithmic complexity for<U+000a>short
  strings, an approximation of the Kolmogorov Complexity of a short<U+000a>string
  using the coding theorem method (see ?acss). The database containing<U+000a>the
  complexity is provided in the data only package acss.data, this package<U+000a>provides
  functions accessing the data such as prob_random returning the<U+000a>posterior
  probability that a given string was produced by a random process.<U+000a>In addition,
  two traditional (but problematic) measures of complexity are<U+000a>also provided:
  entropy and change complexity.'
