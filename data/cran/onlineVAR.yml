title: Online Fitting of Time-Adaptive Lasso Vector Auto Regression
maintainer: Jakob Messner
description: Functions for recursive online fitting of time-adaptive lasso vector
  auto regression. A recursive coordinate descent algorithm is used to estimate sparse
  vector auto regressive models and exponential forgetting is applied to allow model
  changes. Details can be found in Jakob W. Messner and Pierre Pinson (2018). "Online
  adaptive LASSO estimation in Vector Auto Regressive models for wind power forecasting
  in high dimension". International Journal of Forecasting, in press. <doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.02.001>.
