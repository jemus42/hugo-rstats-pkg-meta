title: Prediction of Therapeutic Success
maintainer: Wim Van der Elst
description: In personalized medicine, one wants to know, for a given patient and
  his or her outcome for a predictor (pre-treatment variable), how likely it is that
  a treatment will be more beneficial than an alternative treatment. This package
  allows for the quantification of the predictive causal association (i.e., the association
  between the predictor variable and the individual causal effect of the treatment)
  and related metrics. Part of this software has been developed using funding provided
  from the European Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development
  and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
