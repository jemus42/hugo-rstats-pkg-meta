  Wraps 'libnabo', a Fast K Nearest Neighbour Library for Low
  Dimensions
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  An R wrapper for 'libnabo', an exact or approximate k nearest
  neighbour library which is optimised for low dimensional spaces (e.g. 3D).
  'libnabo' has speed and space advantages over the 'ANN' library wrapped by
  package 'RANN'. 'nabor' includes a knn function that is designed as a
  drop-in replacement for 'RANN' function nn2. In addition, objects which
  include the k-d tree search structure can be returned to speed up repeated
  queries of the same set of target points.
