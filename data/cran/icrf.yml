title: Interval Censored Recursive Forests
maintainer: Hunyong Cho
description: |-
  Implements interval censored recursive forests (ICRF) based on Cho, Jewell, and Kosorok (2020+).
  ICRF is a variant of random forests where the outcome variable is interval censored survival data.
  It can be used for usual right censored data and current status data as well.
  A recursion technique is used to improve accuracy and smoothed survival curves are provided.
