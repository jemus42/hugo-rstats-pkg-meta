title: Biplot representations of categorical data
maintainer: Julio Cesar Hernandez Sanchez
description: Analysis of a matrix of polytomous items using Nominal Logistic Biplots
  (NLB)<U+000a>according to Hernandez-Sanchez and Vicente-Villardon (2013).<U+000a>The
  NLB procedure extends the binary logistic biplot to nominal (polytomous) data.<U+000a>The  individuals
  are represented as points on a plane and the  variables are represented<U+000a>as
  convex prediction regions rather than vectors as in a classical or binary biplot.<U+000a>Using
  the methods from Computational Geometry, the set of prediction regions is converted
  to a set of points<U+000a>in such a way that the prediction for each individual
  is established by its closest<U+000a>"category point". Then interpretation is based
  on distances rather than on projections.<U+000a>In this package we implement the
  geometry of such a representation and construct computational algorithms<U+000a>for
  the estimation of parameters and the calculation of prediction regions.
