  Efficient Jonckheere-Terpstra Test Statistics for Robust Machine
  Learning and Genome-Wide Association Studies
maintainer: Jiaxing Lin
description: This 'Rcpp'-based package implements highly efficient functions for the
  calculation of the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic. It can be used for a variety of
  applications, including feature selection in machine learning problems, or to conduct
  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with multiple quantitative phenotypes. The
  code leverages 'OpenMP' directives for multi-core computing to reduce overall processing
  time.
