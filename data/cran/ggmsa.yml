title: Plot Multiple Sequence Alignment using 'ggplot2'
maintainer: Guangchuang Yu
description: Supports visualizing multiple sequence alignment of DNA and protein sequences
  using 'ggplot2'. It supports a number of colour schemes, including Chemistry, Clustal,
  Shapely, Taylor and Zappo. Multiple sequence alignment can easily be combined with
  other 'ggplot2' plots, such as aligning a phylogenetic tree produced by 'ggtree'
  with multiple sequence alignment.
