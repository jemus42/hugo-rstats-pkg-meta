title: Propensity Clustering and Decomposition
maintainer: Peter Langfelder
description: |-
  Implementation of propensity clustering and
  decomposition as described in Ranola et al. (2013) <doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-21>.
  Propensity decomposition can be viewed on the
  one hand as a generalization of the eigenvector-based
  approximation of correlation networks, and on the other hand as
  a generalization of random multigraph models and
  conformity-based decompositions.
