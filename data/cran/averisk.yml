  Calculation of Average Population Attributable Fractions and
  Confidence Intervals
maintainer: John Ferguson
description: |-
  Average population attributable fractions are calculated for a set
  of risk factors (either binary or ordinal valued) for both prospective and case-
  control designs. Confidence intervals are found by Monte Carlo simulation. The
  method can be applied to either prospective or case control designs, provided an
  estimate of disease prevalence is provided. In addition to an exact calculation
  of AF, an approximate calculation, based on randomly sampling permutations has
  been implemented to ensure the calculation is computationally tractable when the
  number of risk factors is large.
