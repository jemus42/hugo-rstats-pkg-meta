title: Learning Causal Cyclic Graphs from Unknown Shift Interventions
maintainer: Christina Heinze-Deml
description: |-
  Code for 'backShift', an algorithm to estimate the connectivity
  matrix of a directed (possibly cyclic) graph with hidden variables. The
  underlying system is required to be linear and we assume that observations
  under different shift interventions are available. For more details,
  see <arXiv:1506.02494>.
