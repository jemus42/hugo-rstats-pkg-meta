title: Fst-Heterozygosity Smoothed Quantiles
maintainer: Sarah P. Flanagan
description: A program to generate smoothed quantiles for the Fst-heterozygosity distribution.
  Designed for use with large numbers of loci (e.g., genome-wide SNPs). The best case
  for analyzing the Fst-heterozygosity distribution is when many populations (>10)
  have been sampled. See Flanagan & Jones (2017) <doi:10.1093/jhered/esx048>.
