title: Constrained Generalized Additive Model
maintainer: Xiyue Liao
description: 'A constrained generalized additive model is fitted by the cgam routine.
  Given a set of predictors, each of which may have a shape or order restrictions,
  the maximum likelihood estimator for the constrained generalized additive model
  is found using an iteratively re-weighted cone projection algorithm. The ShapeSelect
  routine chooses a subset of predictor variables and describes the component relationships
  with the response. For each predictor, the user needs only specify a set of possible
  shape or order restrictions. A model selection method chooses the shapes and orderings
  of the relationships as well as the variables. The cone information criterion (CIC)
  is used to select the best combination of variables and shapes. A genetic algorithm
  may be used when the set of possible models is large. In addition, the cgam routine
  implements a two-dimensional isotonic regression using warped-plane splines without
  additivity assumptions.  It can also fit a convex or concave regression surface
  with triangle splines without additivity assumptions. See Liao X, Meyer MC (2019)<doi:
  10.18637/jss.v089.i05> for more details.'
