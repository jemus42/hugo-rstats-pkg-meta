title: Genotype Quality Control with 'PLINK'
maintainer: Hannah Meyer
description: |-
  Genotyping arrays enable the direct measurement of an individuals
  genotype at thousands of markers. 'plinkQC' facilitates genotype quality
  control for genetic association studies as described by Anderson and
  colleagues (2010) <doi:10.1038/nprot.2010.116>. It makes 'PLINK' basic
  statistics (e.g. missing genotyping rates per individual, allele frequencies
  per genetic marker) and relationship functions accessible from 'R' and
  generates a per-individual and per-marker quality control report.
  Individuals and markers that fail the quality control can subsequently be
  removed to generate a new, clean dataset. Removal of individuals based on
  relationship status is optimised to retain as many individuals as possible
  in the study.
