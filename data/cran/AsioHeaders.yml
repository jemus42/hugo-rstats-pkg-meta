description: |-
  'Asio' is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level
  I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model
  using a modern C++ approach. It is also included in Boost but requires linking
  when used with Boost. Standalone it can be used header-only (provided a recent
  compiler). 'Asio' is written and maintained by Christopher M. Kohlhoff, and
  released under the 'Boost Software License', Version 1.0.
