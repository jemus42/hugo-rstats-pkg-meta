  Provides several functions to create and manipulate fuzzy
  cognitive maps. It is based on 'FCMapper' for Excel, distributed at <http://
  www.fcmappers.net/joomla/>, developed by Michael Bachhofer and Martin Wildenberg.
  Maps are inputted as adjacency matrices. Attributes of the maps and the
  equilibrium values of the concepts (including with user-defined constrained
  values) can be calculated. The maps can be graphed with a function that calls
  'igraph'. Multiple maps with shared concepts can be aggregated.
