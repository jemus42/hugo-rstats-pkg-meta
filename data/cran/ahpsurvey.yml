title: Analytic Hierarchy Process for Survey Data
maintainer: Frankie Cho
description: The Analytic Hierarchy Process is a versatile multi-criteria decision-making
  tool introduced by Saaty (1987) <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(87)90473-8> that allows decision-makers
  to weigh attributes and evaluate alternatives presented to them.    This package
  provides a consistent methodology for researchers to reformat data and run analytic
  hierarchy process in R on data that are formatted using the survey data entry mode.
  It is optimized for performing the analytic hierarchy process with many decision-makers,
  and provides tools and options for researchers to aggregate individual preferences
  and test multiple options. It also allows researchers to quantify, visualize and
  correct for inconsistency in the decision-maker's comparisons.
