description: |-
  Tools for data importation, recoding, and inspection.
  There are functions to create new project
  folders, R code templates, create uniquely named output
  directories, and to quickly obtain a visual summary for each
  variable in a data frame.  The main feature here is the systematic
  implementation of the "variable key" framework for data
  importation and recoding.  We are eager to have community feedback
  about the variable key and the vignette about it. In version 1.7,
  the function 'semTable' is removed. It was deprecated since 1.67.
  That is provided in a separate package, 'semTable'.
