title: Gene-Based Segregation Test
maintainer: Dandi Qiao
description: Implements the gene-based segregation test(GESE) and the weighted GESE
  test for identifying genes with causal variants of large effects for family-based
  sequencing data. The methods are described in Qiao, D. Lange, C., Laird, N.M., Won,
  S., Hersh, C.P., et al. (2017). <DOI:10.1002/gepi.22037>. Gene-based segregation
  method for identifying rare variants for family-based sequencing studies. Genet
  Epidemiol 41(4):309-319. More details can be found at <http://scholar.harvard.edu/dqiao/gese>.
