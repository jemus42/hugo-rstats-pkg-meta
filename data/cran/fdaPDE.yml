  Statistical Analysis of Functional and Spatial Data, Based on
  Regression with PDE Regularization
maintainer: Eleonora Arnone
description: An implementation of regression models with partial differential regularizations,
  making use of the Finite Element Method. The models efficiently handle data distributed
  over irregularly shaped domains and can comply with various conditions at the boundaries
  of the domain. A priori information about the spatial structure of the phenomenon
  under study can be incorporated in the model via the differential regularization.
  See Sangalli, L.M., Ramsay, J.O., Ramsay, T.O. (2013), Spatial spline regression
  models for an overview.
