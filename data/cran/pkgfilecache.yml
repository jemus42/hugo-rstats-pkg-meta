title: Download and Manage Optional Package Data
maintainer: Tim Sch√§fer
description: Manage optional data for your package. The data can be hosted anywhere,
  and you have to give a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for each file. File integrity
  checks are supported. This is useful for package authors who need to ship more than
  the 5 Megabyte of data currently allowed by the the Comprehensive R Archive Network
  (CRAN).
