title: Adaptive Mixture of Student-t Distributions
maintainer: David Ardia
description: |-
  Provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture
  of Student-t distributions to a target density through its kernel function as described in
  Ardia et al. (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i03>. The
  mixture approximation can then be used as the importance density in importance
  sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
  obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself.
