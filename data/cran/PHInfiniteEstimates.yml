title: Tools for Inference in the Presence of a Monotone Likelihood
maintainer: John E. Kolassa
description: Proportional hazards estimation in the presence of a partially monotone
  likelihood has difficulties, in that finite estimators do not exist.  These difficulties
  are related to those arising from logistic and multinomial regression.  References
  for methods are given in the separate function documents.
