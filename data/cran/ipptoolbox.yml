description: |-
  Uncertainty quantification and propagation in the framework of
  Dempster-Shafer Theory and imprecise probabilities. This toolbox offers
  easy-to-use methods for using imprecise probabities for applied uncertainty
  modelling and simulation. The package comprises the basic functionality
  needed, with usability similar to standard probabilistic analysis:
  - Fit imprecise probability distributions from data,
  - Define imprecise probabilities based on distribution functions,
  - Combine with various aggregation rules (e. g. Dempster's rule),
  - Plotting tools,
  - Propagate through arbitrary functions / simulations via Monte Carlo,
  - Perform sensitivity analyses with imprecise distributions,
  - Example models for a quick start.
