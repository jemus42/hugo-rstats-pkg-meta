title: Tools for Validation the Dataset
maintainer: Konstantin Ryabov
description: |-
  For checking the dataset from EDC(Electronic Data Capture) in clinical trials.
  'dmtools' can check laboratory, dates, WBCs(White Blood Cells) count and rename the dataset.
  Laboratory - does the investigator correctly estimate the laboratory analyzes?
  Dates - do all dates correspond to the protocol's timeline?
  WBCs count - do absolute equal (all * relative) / 100?
  If the clinical trial has different lab reference ranges, 'dmtools' also can help.
