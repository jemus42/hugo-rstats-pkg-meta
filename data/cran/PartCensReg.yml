  Estimation and Diagnostics for Partially Linear Censored
  Regression Models Based on Heavy-Tailed Distributions
maintainer: Marcela Nunez Lemus
description: It estimates the parameters of a partially linear regression censored
  model via maximum penalized likelihood through of ECME algorithm. The model belong
  to the semiparametric class, that including a parametric and nonparametric component.
  The error term considered belongs to the scale-mixture of normal (SMN) distribution,
  that includes well-known heavy tails distributions as the Student-t distribution,
  among others. To examine the performance of the fitted model, case-deletion and
  local influence techniques are provided to show its robust aspect against outlying
  and influential observations. This work is based in Ferreira, C. S., & Paula, G.
  A. (2017) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2016.1267124> but considering the SMN family.
