  Identification of Transcriptional Dynamics using Pulse Models
  via 4su-Seq Data and RNA-Seq Data
maintainer: XinWang
description: A tool for analyzing the transcription, processing and degradation rates
  of genes by 4sU-seq (the Metabolic Label 4-thiouridine) data and RNA-seq (RNA sequencing)
  data. It can not only recognize the transcriptional dynamic rates at the measurement
  time points, but also obtain continuous changes in transcriptional dynamics. More
  importantly, it is able to predict the trend of mRNA (Mature RNA) transcription
  and expression changes in the future.
