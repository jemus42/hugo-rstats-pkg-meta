title: Visualizations for 'mlr3'
maintainer: Michel Lang
description: |-
  Provides visualizations for 'mlr3' objects such as tasks,
  predictions, resample results or benchmark results via the autoplot()
  generic of 'ggplot2'. The returned 'ggplot' objects are intended to provide
  sensible defaults, yet can easily be customized to create camera-ready
  figures. Visualizations include barplots, boxplots, histograms, ROC curves,
  and Precision-Recall curves.
