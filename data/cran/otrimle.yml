title: Robust Model-Based Clustering
maintainer: Pietro Coretto
description: Performs robust cluster analysis allowing for outliers and noise that
  cannot be fitted by any cluster. The data are modelled by a mixture of Gaussian
  distributions and a noise component, which is an improper uniform  distribution
  covering the whole Euclidean space. Parameters are estimated by  (pseudo) maximum
  likelihood. This is fitted by a EM-type algorithm. See Coretto and Hennig (2016)
