title: Parallel Mutual Information estimation for Gene Network<U+000a>reconstruction.
maintainer: Gabriele Sales
description: The package provides a parallel estimation of the mutual<U+000a>information
  based on entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbors<U+000a>distances and algorithms
  for the reconstruction of gene<U+000a>regulatory networks.
