description: The DnE package involves functions to analyse the distribution of a set
  of given data. The basic idea of the analysis is chi-squared test. Functions which
  have the form as "is.xxdistribution" are used to analyse whether the data obeys
  the xxdistrbution. If you do not know which distribution to judge, use function
  is.dt().
