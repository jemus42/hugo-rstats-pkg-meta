title: Spatial Data Analysis
maintainer: Robert J. Hijmans
description: Methods for spatial data analysis, especially raster data. Methods allow
  for low-level data manipulation as well as high-level global, local, zonal, and
  focal computation. The predict and interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression
  type (interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial prediction. Processing
  of very large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on <https://rspatial.org/terra/>
  to get started. The package is similar to the 'raster' package; but it is simpler
  and faster.
