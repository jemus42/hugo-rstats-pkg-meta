title: High Dimensional Locally-Linear Mapping
maintainer: Emeline Perthame
description: Provides a tool for non linear mapping (non linear regression) using
  a mixture of regression model and an inverse regression strategy. The methods include
  the GLLiM model (see Deleforge et al (2015) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-014-9461-5>) based
  on Gaussian mixtures and a robust version of GLLiM, named SLLiM (see Perthame et
  al (2016) <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01347455>) based on a mixture of
  Generalized Student distributions. The methods also include BLLiM (see Devijver
  et al (2017) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07899>) which is an extension of GLLiM
  with a sparse block diagonal structure for large covariance matrices (particularly
  interesting for transcriptomic data).
