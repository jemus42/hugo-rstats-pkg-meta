maintainer: Berend Hasselman
description: |-
  Solve a system of nonlinear equations using a Broyden or a Newton method
  with a choice of global strategies such as line search and trust region.
  There are options for using a numerical or user supplied Jacobian,
  for specifying a banded numerical Jacobian and for allowing
  a singular or ill-conditioned Jacobian.
