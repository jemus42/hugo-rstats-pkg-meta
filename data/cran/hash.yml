version: 2.2.6
title: Full feature implementation of hash/associated<U+000a>arrays/dictionaries
maintainer: Christopher Brown
description: This package implements a data structure similar to hashes<U+000a>in
  Perl and dictionaries in Python but with a purposefully R<U+000a>flavor.  For objects
  of appreciable size, access using hashes<U+000a>outperforms native named lists and
  vectors.
