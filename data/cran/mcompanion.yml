title: Objects and Methods for Multi-Companion Matrices
maintainer: Georgi N. Boshnakov
description: |2-

  Provides a class for multi-companion matrices with methods for
  arithmetic and factorization.  A method for generation of
  multi-companion matrices with prespecified spectral properties is
  provided, as well as some utilities for periodically correlated and
  multivariate time series models. See Boshnakov (2002)
