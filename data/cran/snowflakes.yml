title: Random Snowflake Generator
maintainer: Svetlana Eden
description: The function generates and plots random snowflakes. Each snowflake is
  defined by a given diameter, width of the crystal, color, and random seed. Snowflakes
  are plotted in such way that they always remain round, no matter what the aspect
  ratio of the plot is. Snowflakes can be created using transparent colors, which
  creates a more interesting, somewhat realistic, image. Images of the snowflakes
  can be separately saved as svg files and used in websites as static or animated
  images.
