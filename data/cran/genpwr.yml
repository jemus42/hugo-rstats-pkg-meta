title: Power Calculations Under Genetic Model Misspecification
maintainer: Camille Moore
description: |-
  Power and sample size calculations for genetic association studies allowing
  for misspecification of the model of genetic susceptibility.
  Power and/or sample size can be calculated for logistic (case/control study design)
  and linear (continuous phenotype) regression models, using additive, dominant,
  recessive or degree of freedom coding of the genetic covariate while assuming
  a true dominant, recessive or additive genetic effect. In addition, power and
  sample size calculations can be performed for gene by environment interactions.
  These methods are extensions of Gauderman (2002)
  <doi:10.1093/aje/155.5.478> and Gauderman (2002) <doi:10.1002/sim.973>
  and are described in:
