  Weibull Regression for a Right-Censored Endpoint with
  Interval-Censored Covariate
maintainer: Stanislas Hubeaux
description: The main function of this package allows estimation of a Weibull Regression
  for a right-censored endpoint, one interval-censored covariate, and an arbitrary
  number of non-censored covariates. Additional functions allow to switch between
  different parametrizations of Weibull regression used by different R functions,
  inference for the mean difference of two arbitrarily censored Normal samples, and
  estimation of canonical parameters from censored samples for several distributional
  assumptions.
