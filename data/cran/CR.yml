title: Power Calculation for Weighted Log-Rank Tests in Cure Rate<U+000a>Models
maintainer: Emil A. Cornea
description: This package contains R-functions to perform power<U+000a>calculation
  in a group sequential clinical trial with censored<U+000a>survival data and possibly
  unequal patient allocation between<U+000a>treatment and control groups. The fuctions
  can also be used to<U+000a>determine the study duration in a clinical trial with
  censored<U+000a>survival data as the sum of the accrual duration, which<U+000a>determines
  the sample size in a traditional sense, and the<U+000a>follow-up duration, which
  more or less controls the number of<U+000a>events to be observed. This package also
  contains R functions<U+000a>and methods to display the computed results.
