title: A Penalized EM algorithm incorporating missing-data mechanism
maintainer: Lin Chen
description: This package provides functions to perform multivariate Gaussian parameter
  estimation based on data with abundance-dependent missingness. It implements a penalized
  Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The package is tailored for but not limited
  to proteomics data applications, in which a large proportion of the data are often
  missing-not-at-random with lower values (or absolute values) more likely to be missing.
