title: Astrobiology Equations Estimating Extraterrestrial Life
maintainer: Chester C. Deocaris
description: Finding life outside the planet Earth several is the ultimate goal of
  an astrobiologist. Using known astronomical measurements and assumptions the probability
  of extraterrestrial life existence could be estimated. Equations such as the Drake
  equation (1961) as stated in the paper of Molina (2019) <arXiv:1912.01783>, Seager
  (2013) <https://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html> and Foucher
  et al, (2017) <doi:10.3390/life7040040> are included in the 'extraterrestrial' package.
