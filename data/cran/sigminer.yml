title: Extract, Analyze and Visualize Signatures for Genomic Variations
maintainer: Shixiang Wang
description: |-
  Genomic alterations including single nucleotide
  substitution, copy number alteration, etc. are the major force for
  cancer initialization and development. Due to the specificity of
  molecular lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate
  characteristic alteration spectra, called 'signature' (Wang, Shixiang,
  et al.  (2020) <DOI:10.1101/2020.04.27.20082404> & Alexandrov, Ludmil
  B., et al. (2020) <DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3> & Macintyre, Geoff,
  et al. (2018) <DOI:10.1038/s41588-018-0179-8>).  This package helps
  users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic
  alteration records, thus providing new insight into cancer study.
