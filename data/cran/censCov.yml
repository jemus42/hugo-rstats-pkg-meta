maintainer: Sy Han (Steven) Chiou
description: |-
  Implementations of threshold regression approaches for linear
  regression models with a covariate subject to random censoring,
  including deletion threshold regression and completion threshold regression.
  Reverse survival regression, which flip the role of response variable and the
