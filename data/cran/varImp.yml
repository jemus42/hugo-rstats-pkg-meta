title: RF Variable Importance for Arbitrary Measures
maintainer: Philipp Probst
description: Computes the random forest variable importance (VIMP) for the conditional
  inference random forest (cforest) of the 'party' package. Includes a function (varImp)
  that computes the VIMP for arbitrary measures from the 'measures' package. For calculating
  the VIMP regarding the measures accuracy and AUC two extra functions exist (varImpACC
  and varImpAUC).
