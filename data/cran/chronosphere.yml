description: The purpose of the 'chronosphere' project is to facilitate spatially
  explicit analyses of (paleo)environmental/ecological research. The package serves
  as a gateway to plate tectonic reconstructions, deep time global climate model results
  as well as fossil occurrence datasets such as the Paleobiology Database <https://www.paleobiodb.org/>
  and the PaleoReefs Database <https://www.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de/>. Environmental
  data stored on a remote server can be downloaded and imported directly to the R
  environment. Query functions to the GPlates <http://www.gplates.org/> desktop application
  or the GPlates Web Service <https://gws.gplates.org/> allow users to reconstruct
  coordinates, static plates, and Spatial objects. A wrapper class 'RasterArray' is
  implemented around the 'RasterLayer' class, allowing the organization of spatially
  explicit raster data in n-dimensional arrays. The project is developed under the
  umbrella of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) Research Unit TERSANE2 (For
  2332, TEmperature Related Stressors in ANcient Extinctions).
