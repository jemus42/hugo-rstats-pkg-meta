title: A Framework for Coalescent Simulation
maintainer: Paul Staab
description: |-
  Coalescent simulators can rapidly simulate biological sequences
  evolving according to a given model of evolution.
  You can use this package to specify such models, to conduct the simulations
  and to calculate additional statistics from the results.
  It relies on existing simulators for doing the simulation, and currently
  supports the programs 'ms', 'msms' and 'scrm'. It also supports finite-sites
  mutation models by combining the simulators with the program 'seq-gen'.
