version: 3.0.2
title: LaTeX Wrappers for R Users
maintainer: Benjamin Nutter
description: |-
  Provides the functionality to write LaTeX code from within R
  without having to learn LaTeX.  Functionality also exists to create HTML
  and Markdown code.  While the functionality still exists to write
  complete documents with lazyWeave, it is generally easier to do so with
  with markdown and knitr.  lazyWeave's main strength now is the ability
  to design custom and complex tables for reporting results.
