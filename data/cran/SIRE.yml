  Finding Feedback Effects in SEM and Testing for Their
  Significance
maintainer: Gianmarco Vacca
description: |-
  Provides two main functionalities.
  1 - Given a system of simultaneous equation,
  it decomposes  the matrix of coefficients weighting the endogenous variables
  into three submatrices: one includes the subset of coefficients that have a causal nature
  in the model, two include the subset of coefficients that have a interdependent nature
  in the model, either at systematic level or induced by the correlation between error terms.
  2 - Given a decomposed model,
  it tests for the significance of the interdependent relationships acting in the system,
  via Maximum likelihood and Wald test, which can be built starting from the function output.
