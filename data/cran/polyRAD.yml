  Genotype Calling with Uncertainty from Sequencing Data in
  Polyploids and Diploids
maintainer: Lindsay V. Clark
description: |-
  Read depth data from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) or restriction
  site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) are imported and used to make Bayesian
  probability estimates of genotypes in polyploids or diploids.  The genotype
  probabilities, posterior mean genotypes, or most probable genotypes can then
  be exported for downstream analysis.  'polyRAD' is described by Clark et al.
  (2019) <doi:10.1534/g3.118.200913>.  A variant calling pipeline for highly
  duplicated genomes is also included and is described by Clark et al. (2020)
  <doi:10.1101/2020.01.11.902890>.
