title: Create and Query a Local 'PubTator' Database
maintainer: Zachary Colburn
description: '''PubTator'' <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/>
  is a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) tool that enhances the
  annotation of articles on PubMed <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/>. It makes
  it possible to rapidly identify potential relationships between genes or proteins
  using text mining techniques. In contrast, manually searching for and reading the
  annotated articles would be very time consuming. ''PubTator'' offers both an online
  interface and a RESTful API, however, neither of these approaches are well suited
  for frequent, high-throughput analyses. The package ''pubtatordb'' provides a set
  of functions that make it easy for the average R user to download ''PubTator'' annotations,
  create, and then query a local version of the database.'
