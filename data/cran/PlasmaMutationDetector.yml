title: Tumor Mutation Detection in Plasma
maintainer: Yves Rozenholc
description: |-
  Aims at detecting single nucleotide variation
  (SNV) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), used
  as a surrogate marker for tumor, at each base position of an Next Generation
  Sequencing (NGS) analysis. Mutations are assessed by comparing the minor-allele
  frequency at each position to the measured PER in control samples.
