title: Dark Mode for 'ggplot2' Themes
maintainer: Neal Grantham
description: |-
  Activate dark mode on your favorite 'ggplot2' theme
  with dark_mode() or use the dark versions of
  'ggplot2' themes, including dark_theme_gray(),
  dark_theme_minimal(), and others. When a dark theme
  is applied, all geom color and geom fill defaults
  are changed to make them visible against a dark
  background. To restore the defaults to their original
  values, use invert_geom_defaults().
