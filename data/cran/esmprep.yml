  Data Preparation During and After the Use of the Experience
  Sampling Methodology (ESM)
maintainer: Marcel Mich√©
description: Support in preparing a raw ESM dataset for statistical analysis. Preparation
  includes the handling of errors (mostly due to technological reasons) and the generating
  of new variables that are necessary and/or helpful in meeting the conditions when
  statistically analyzing ESM data. The functions in 'esmprep' are meant to hierarchically
  lead from bottom, i.e. the raw (separated) ESM dataset(s), to top, i.e. a single
  ESM dataset ready for statistical analysis. This hierarchy evolved out of my personal
  experience in working with ESM data.
