  Regularized Multivariate Regression for Identifying Master
  Predictors Using the GroupRemMap Penalty
maintainer: Xianlong Wang
description: An implementation of the GroupRemMap penalty for fitting regularized
  multivariate response regression models under the high-dimension-low-sample-size
  setting. When the predictors naturally fall into groups, the GroupRemMap penalty
  encourages procedure to select groups of predictors, while control for the overall
  sparsity of the final model.
