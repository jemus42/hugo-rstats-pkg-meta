title: Arrange 'Grobs' in Tables
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: |-
  Tools to make it easier to work with "tables" of
  'grobs'. The 'gtable' package defines a 'gtable' grob class that specifies a
  grid along with a list of grobs and their placement in the grid. Further the
  package makes it easy to manipulate and combine 'gtable' objects so that
  complex compositions can be build up sequentially.
