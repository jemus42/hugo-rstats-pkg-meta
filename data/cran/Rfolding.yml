maintainer: Alban Siffer
description: |-
  The basic algorithm to perform the folding test of unimodality.
  Given a dataset X (d dimensional, n samples), the test checks whether the
  distribution of the data are rather unimodal or rather multimodal. This
  package stems from the following research publication:
  Siffer Alban, Pierre-Alain Fouque, Alexandre Termier, and Christine LargouÃ«t.
