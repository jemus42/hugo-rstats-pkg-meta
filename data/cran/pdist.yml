title: Partitioned Distance Function
maintainer: Jeffrey Wong
description: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X<U+000a>and
  rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could be done<U+000a>by binding the
  two matrices together and calling 'dist', but<U+000a>this creates unnecessary computation
  by computing the distances<U+000a>between a row of X and another row of X, and likewise
  for Y.<U+000a>pdist strictly computes distances across the two matrices, not<U+000a>within
  the same matrix, making computations significantly<U+000a>faster for certain use
  cases.
