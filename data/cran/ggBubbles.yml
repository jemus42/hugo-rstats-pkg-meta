title: Mini Bubble Plots for Comparison of Discrete Data with 'ggplot2'
maintainer: Thomas Schwarzl
description: |-
  When comparing discrete data mini bubble plots allow displaying
  more information than traditional bubble plots via colour, shape or labels.
  Exact overlapping coordinates will be transformed so they surround the
  original point circularly without overlapping. This is implemented as a
  position_surround() function for 'ggplot2'.
