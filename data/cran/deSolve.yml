  Solvers for Initial Value Problems of Differential Equations
  ('ODE', 'DAE', 'DDE')
maintainer: Thomas Petzoldt
description: |-
  Functions that solve initial value problems of a system
  of first-order ordinary differential equations ('ODE'), of
  partial differential equations ('PDE'), of differential
  algebraic equations ('DAE'), and of delay differential
  equations.  The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN
  functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK'
  collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk'
  and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with
  fixed or variable time steps.  The package contains routines
  designed for solving 'ODEs' resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D
  partial differential equations ('PDE') that have been converted
  to 'ODEs' by numerical differencing.
