title: Multidimensional Scaling
maintainer: Patrick Mair
description: 'Implements the following approaches for multidimensional scaling (MDS)
  based on stress minimization using majorization (smacof): ratio/interval/ordinal/spline
  MDS on symmetric dissimilarity matrices, MDS with external constraints on the configuration,
  individual differences scaling (idioscal, indscal), MDS with spherical restrictions,
  and ratio/interval/ordinal/spline unfolding (circular restrictions, row-conditional).
  Various tools and extensions like jackknife MDS, bootstrap MDS, permutation tests,
  MDS biplots, gravity models, unidimensional scaling, drift vectors (asymmetric MDS),
  classical scaling, and Procrustes are implemented as well.'
