title: A collection of functions for estimating centrographic<U+000a>statistics and
  computational geometries for spatial point<U+000a>patterns
maintainer: Ron N. Buliung
description: A collection of functions for computing centrographic<U+000a>statistics
  (e.g., standard distance, standard deviation<U+000a>ellipse, standard deviation
  box) for observations taken at<U+000a>point locations. Separate plotting functions
  have been<U+000a>developed for each measure. Users interested in writing results<U+000a>to
  ESRI shapefiles can do so by using results from aspace<U+000a>functions as inputs
  to the convert.to.shapefile and<U+000a>write.shapefile functions in the shapefiles
  library. The aspace<U+000a>library was originally conceived to aid in the analysis
  of<U+000a>spatial patterns of travel behaviour (see Buliung and Remmel,<U+000a>2008).
  Major changes in the current version include (1) removal<U+000a>of dependencies
  on several external libraries (e.g., gpclib,<U+000a>maptools, sp), (2) the separation
  of plotting and estimation<U+000a>capabilities, (3) reduction in the number of functions,
  and (4)<U+000a>expansion of analytical capabilities with additional functions<U+000a>for
  descriptive analysis and visualization (e.g., standard<U+000a>deviation box, centre
  of minimum distance, central feature).
