maintainer: Thomas Mendlik
description: Methods to calculate and interpret climate change signals and time series
  from climate multi-model ensembles. Climate model output in binary 'NetCDF' format
  is read in and aggregated over a specified region to a data.frame for statistical
  analysis. Global Circulation Models, as the 'CMIP5' simulations, can be read in
  the same way as Regional Climate Models, as e.g. the 'CORDEX' or 'ENSEMBLES' simulations.
  The package has been developed at the 'Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change'
  at the University of Graz, Austria.
