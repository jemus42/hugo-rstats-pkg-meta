title: Active Function Cross-Entropy Clustering
maintainer: Krzysztof Byrski
description: 'Active function cross-entropy clustering partitions the n-dimensional
  data into the clusters by finding the parameters of the mixed generalized multivariate
  normal distribution, that optimally approximates the scattering of the data in the
  n-dimensional space, whose density function is of the form: p_1*N(mi_1,^sigma_1,sigma_1,f_1)+...+p_k*N(mi_k,^sigma_k,sigma_k,f_k).
  The above-mentioned generalization is performed by introducing so called "f-adapted
  Gaussian densities" (i.e. the ordinary Gaussian densities adapted by the "active
  function"). Additionally, the active function cross-entropy clustering performs
  the automatic reduction of the unnecessary clusters. For more information please
