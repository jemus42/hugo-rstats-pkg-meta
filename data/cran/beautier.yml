description: |-
  'BEAST2' (<https://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAUti 2' (which is part of 'BEAST2') is a GUI tool
  that allows users to specify the many possible setups
  and generates the XML file 'BEAST2' needs to run.
  This package provides a way to create 'BEAST2' input
  files without active user input, but using
  R function calls instead.
