  General-Purpose MCMC and SMC Samplers and Tools for Bayesian
  Statistics
maintainer: Florian Hartig
description: |-
  General-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plot and
  diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on
  calibrating complex system models. Implemented samplers include various
  Metropolis MCMC variants (including adaptive and/or delayed rejection MH), the
  T-walk, two differential evolution MCMCs, two DREAM MCMCs, and a sequential
  Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter.
