title: Rendering Risk Literacy more Transparent
maintainer: Hansjoerg Neth
description: Risk-related information (like the prevalence of conditions and the sensitivity
  and specificity of diagnostic tests or treatment decisions) can be expressed in
  terms of probabilities or frequencies. By providing a toolbox of methods and metrics,
  'riskyr' computes, translates, and visualizes risk-related information in a variety
  of ways. Offering multiple complementary perspectives on the interplay between key
  parameters renders teaching and training of risk literacy more transparent.
