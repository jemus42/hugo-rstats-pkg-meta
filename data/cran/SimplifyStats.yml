title: Simplifies Pairwise Statistical Analyses
maintainer: Zachary Colburn
description: Pairwise group comparisons are often performed. While there are many
  packages that can perform these analyses, often it is the case that only a subset
  of comparisons are desired. 'SimplifyStats' performs pairwise comparisons and returns
  the results in a tidy fashion.
