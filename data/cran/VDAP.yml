title: Peptide Array Analysis Tools
maintainer: Cody Moore
description: |-
  Analyze Peptide Array Data and characterize peptide
  sequence space. Allows for high level visualization of global signal, Quality control based
  on replicate correlation and/or relative Kd, calculation of peptide Length/Charge/Kd parameters,
  Hits selection based on RFU Signal, and amino acid composition/basic motif recognition with RFU
  signal weighting. Basic signal trends can be used to generate peptides that follow the observed
  compositional trends.
