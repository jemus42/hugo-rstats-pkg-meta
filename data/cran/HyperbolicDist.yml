title: The hyperbolic distribution
maintainer: David Scott
description: This package provides functions for the hyperbolic and<U+000a>related
  distributions. Density, distribution and quantile<U+000a>functions and random number
  generation are provided for the<U+000a>hyperbolic distribution, the generalized
  hyperbolic<U+000a>distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and<U+000a>the
  skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is<U+000a>provided for the hyperbolic
  distribution, including fitting of<U+000a>the hyperbolic to data.
