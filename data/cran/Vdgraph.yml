  Variance dispersion graphs and Fraction of design space plots
  for response surface designs
maintainer: John Lawson
description: Uses a modification of the published FORTRAN code in "A Computer Program
  for Generating Variance Dispersion Graphs" by G. Vining, Journal of Quality Technology,
  Vol. 25 No. 1 January 1993, to produce variance dispersion graphs. Also produces
  fraction of design space plots, and contains data frames for several minimal run
  response surface designs.
