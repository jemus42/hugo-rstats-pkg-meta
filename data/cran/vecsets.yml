title: Like base::sets Tools But Keeps Duplicate Elements
maintainer: Carl Witthoft
description: |-
  The base 'sets' tools follow the algebraic definition
  that each element of a set must be unique.
  Since it's often helpful to compare all elements of two vectors,
  this toolset treats every element as unique for counting purposes.
  For ease of use, all functions in vecsets have an argument
  'multiple' which, when set to FALSE,
  reverts them to the base::set tools functionality.
