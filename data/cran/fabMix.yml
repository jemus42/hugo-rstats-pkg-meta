  Parsimonious Covariance and Unknown Number of Components

description: 'Model-based clustering of multivariate continuous data using Bayesian
  mixtures of factor analyzers (Papastamoulis (2019) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-019-09891-z>
  (2018) <DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2018.03.007>). The number of clusters is estimated using
  overfitting mixture models (Rousseau and Mengersen (2011) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00781.x>):
  suitable prior assumptions ensure that asymptotically the extra components will
  have zero posterior weight, therefore, the inference is based on the ``alive''''
  components. A Gibbs sampler is implemented in order to (approximately) sample from
  the posterior distribution of the overfitting mixture. A prior parallel tempering
  scheme is also available, which allows to run multiple parallel chains with different
  prior distributions on the mixture weights. These chains run in parallel and can
  swap states using a Metropolis-Hastings move. Eight different parameterizations
  give rise to parsimonious representations of the covariance per cluster (following
  Mc Nicholas and Murphy (2008) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-008-9056-0>). The model parameterization
  and number of factors is selected according to the Bayesian Information Criterion.
  Identifiability issues related to label switching are dealt by post-processing the
  simulated output with the Equivalence Classes Representatives algorithm (Papastamoulis
  and Iliopoulos (2010) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/25703571>, Papastamoulis (2016)
  <DOI:10.18637/jss.v069.c01>).'
