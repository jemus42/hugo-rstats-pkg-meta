title: Query Cache for HTTP Clients
maintainer: Neal Richardson
description: |-
  In order to improve performance for HTTP API clients, 'httpcache'
  provides simple tools for caching and invalidating cache. It includes the
  HTTP verb functions GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE, which are drop-in
  replacements for those in the 'httr' package. These functions are cache-aware
  and provide default settings for cache invalidation suitable for RESTful
  APIs; the package also enables custom cache-management strategies.
  Finally, 'httpcache' includes a basic logging framework to facilitate the
  measurement of HTTP request time and cache performance.
