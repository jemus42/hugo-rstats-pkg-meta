title: Functions Useful in the Design and ANOVA of Experiments
maintainer: Chris Brien
description: |-
  The content falls into the following groupings: (i) Data, (ii)
  Factor manipulation functions, (iii) Design functions, (iv) ANOVA functions, (v)
  Matrix functions, (vi) Projector and canonical efficiency functions, and (vii)
  Miscellaneous functions. There is a vignette describing how to use the
  design functions for randomizing and assessing designs available as a
  vignette called 'DesignNotes'. The ANOVA functions facilitate the extraction of
  information when the 'Error' function has been used in the call to 'aov'.
  The package 'dae' can also be installed from
