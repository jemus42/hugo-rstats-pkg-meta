  In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures

maintainer: Steve Rozen
description: |-
  Analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated mutational
  signatures -- the kind of analysis and visualization in Boot et al.,
  "In-depth characterization of the cisplatin mutational signature in
  human cell lines and in esophageal and liver tumors", Genome Research 2018,
  <doi:10.1101/gr.230219.117>. 'ICAMS' stands for In-depth Characterization
  and Analysis of Mutational Signatures. 'ICAMS' has functions to read in
  variant call files (VCFs) and to collate the corresponding catalogs of
  mutational spectra and to analyze and plot catalogs of mutational spectra
  and signatures. Handles both "counts-based" and "density-based" catalogs
  of mutational spectra or signatures.
