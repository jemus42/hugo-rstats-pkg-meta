title: '''ViennaCL'' C++ Header Files'
maintainer: Charles Determan Jr
description: |-
  'ViennaCL' is a free open-source linear algebra library
  for computations on many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC) and
  multi-core CPUs. The library is written in C++ and supports 'CUDA',
  'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP' (including switches at runtime).
  I have placed these libraries in this package as a more efficient
  distribution system for CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package
  that depends on the 'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to
  distribute a copy of this code with your package.
