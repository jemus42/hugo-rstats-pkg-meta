title: Ridge Regression and Other Kernels for Genomic Selection
maintainer: Jeffrey Endelman
description: Software for genomic prediction with the RR-BLUP mixed model (Endelman
  2011, <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2011.08.0024>). One application is to estimate marker
  effects by ridge regression; alternatively, BLUPs can be calculated based on an
  additive relationship matrix or a Gaussian kernel.
