title: Causal Mediation Analysis Using Weighting Approach
maintainer: Xu Qin
description: We implement causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed by
  Hong (2010) and Hong, Deutsch & Hill (2015) <doi:10.3102/1076998615583902>. It allows
  the estimation and hypothesis testing of causal mediation effects through ratio
  of mediator probability weights (RMPW). This strategy conveniently relaxes the assumption
  of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model
  specification without invoking strong distributional assumptions. We also implement
  a sensitivity analysis by extending the RMPW method to assess potential bias in
  the presence of omitted pretreatment or posttreatment covariates. The sensitivity
  analysis strategy was proposed by Hong, Qin, and Yang (2018) <doi:10.3102/1076998617749561>.
