version: 1.0.2.1
title: Crosstab and Statistical Tests for OII MSc Stats Course
maintainer: Scott Hale
description: Provides simple crosstab output with optional statistics (e.g., Goodman-Kruskal
  Gamma, Somers' d, and Kendall's tau-b) as well as two-way and one-way tables. The
  package is used within the statistics component of the Masters of Science (MSc)
  in Social Science of the Internet at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), University
  of Oxford, but the functions should be useful for general data analysis and especially
  for analysis of categorical and ordinal data.
