  Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Stochastic Differential

maintainer: Martin Lysy
description: Implements an MCMC sampler for the posterior distribution of arbitrary
  time-homogeneous multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with
  possibly latent components.  The package provides a simple entry point to integrate
  user-defined models directly with the sampler's C++ code, and parallelizes large
  portions of the calculations when compiled with 'OpenMP'.
