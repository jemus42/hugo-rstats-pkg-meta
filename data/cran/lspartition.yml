description: 'Tools for statistical analysis using partitioning-based least squares
  regression as described in Cattaneo, Farrell and Feng (2019a, <arXiv:1804.04916>)
  and Cattaneo, Farrell and Feng (2019b, <arXiv:1906.00202>): lsprobust() for nonparametric
  point estimation of regression functions and their derivatives and for robust bias-corrected
  (pointwise and uniform) inference; lspkselect() for data-driven selection of the
  IMSE-optimal number of knots; lsprobust.plot() for regression plots with robust
  confidence intervals and confidence bands; lsplincom() for estimation and inference
  for linear combinations of regression functions from different groups.'
