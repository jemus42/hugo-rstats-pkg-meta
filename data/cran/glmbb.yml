  Model
maintainer: Charles J. Geyer
description: |-
  Find all hierarchical models of specified generalized linear
  model with information criterion (AIC, BIC, or AICc) within specified
  cutoff of minimum value.  Alternatively, find all such graphical models.
  Use branch and bound algorithm so we do not have to fit all models.
