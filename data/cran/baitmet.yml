  Library Driven Compound Profiling in Gas Chromatography - Mass
  Spectrometry Data

description: Automated quantification of metabolites by targeting mass spectral/retention
  time libraries into full scan-acquired gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
  chromatograms. Baitmet outputs a table with compounds name, spectral matching score,
  retention index error, and compounds area in each sample. Baitmet can automatically
  determine the compounds retention indexes with or without co-injection of internal
  standards with samples.
