  Confidence or Prediction Intervals, Quantiles, and Probabilities
  for Statistical Models
maintainer: John Haman
description: |-
  Functions to append confidence intervals, prediction intervals,
  and other quantities of interest to data frames. All appended quantities
  are for the response variable, after conditioning on the model and covariates.
  This package has a data frame first syntax that allows for easy piping.
  Currently supported models include (log-) linear, (log-) linear mixed,
  generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and
  accelerated failure time models.
