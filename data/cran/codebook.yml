title: Automatic Codebooks from Metadata Encoded in Dataset Attributes
maintainer: Ruben Arslan
description: |-
  Easily automate the following tasks to describe data frames:
  Summarise the distributions, and labelled missings of variables graphically
  and using descriptive statistics.
  For surveys, compute and summarise reliabilities (internal consistencies,
  retest, multilevel) for psychological scales.
  Combine this information with metadata (such as item labels and labelled
  values) that is derived from R attributes.
  To do so, the package relies on 'rmarkdown' partials, so you can generate
  HTML, PDF, and Word documents.
  Codebooks are also available as tables (CSV, Excel, etc.) and in JSON-LD, so
  that search engines can find your data and index the metadata.
  The metadata are also available at your fingertips via RStudio Addins.
