title: Fitting Ising Models Using the ELasso Method
maintainer: Claudia van Borkulo
description: This network estimation procedure eLasso, which is based on the Ising
  model, combines l1-regularized logistic regression with model selection based on
  the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC). EBIC is a fit measure that identifies
  relevant relationships between variables. The resulting network consists of variables
  as nodes and relevant relationships as edges. Can deal with binary data.
