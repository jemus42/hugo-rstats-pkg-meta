description: |-
  This is an implementation of the Generalized Discrimination Score
  (also known as Two Alternatives Forced Choice Score, 2AFC) for various
  representations of forecasts and verifying observations. The Generalized
  Discrimination Score is a generic forecast verification framework which
  can be applied to any of the following verification contexts: dichotomous,
  polychotomous (ordinal and nominal), continuous, probabilistic, and ensemble.
  A comprehensive description of the Generalized Discrimination Score, including
  all equations used in this package, is provided by Mason and Weigel (2009)
  <doi:10.1175/MWR-D-10-05069.1>.
