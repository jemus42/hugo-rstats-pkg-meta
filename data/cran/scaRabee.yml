maintainer: Sebastien Bihorel
description: |-
  scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally
  written as a Matlab-based application. It provides a framework
  for simulation and optimization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
  models at the individual and population level. It is built on top of the
  neldermead package, which provides the direct search algorithm proposed
  by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
