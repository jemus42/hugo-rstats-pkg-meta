title: R commander Depth Tools Plug-In
maintainer: Aurora Torrente
description: |-
  This package provides an Rcmdr plug-in based on the
  depthTools package, which implements different robust
  statistical tools for the description and analysis of gene
  expression data based on the Modified Band Depth, namely, the
  scale curves for visualizing the dispersion of one or various
  groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to decide
  whether two groups of samples come from a single distribution
  and two methods of supervised classification techniques, the DS
  and TAD methods.
