title: Tests in Linear Mixed Effects Models
maintainer: Sofie PÃ¸denphant Jensen
description: |-
  Provides p-values in type I, II or III anova and summary tables
  for lmer model fits (cf. lme4) via Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom method. A
  Kenward-Roger method is also available via the pbkrtest package. Model selection
  methods include step, drop1 and anova-like tables for random effects (ranova).
  Methods for Least-Square means (LS-means) and tests of linear contrasts of fixed
