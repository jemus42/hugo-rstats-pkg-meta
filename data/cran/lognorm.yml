  The lognormal distribution
  (Limpert et al. (2001) <doi:10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0341:lndats%5D2.0.co;2>)
  can characterize uncertainty that is bounded by zero.
  This package provides estimation of distribution parameters, computation of
  moments and other basic statistics, and an approximation of the distribution
  of the sum of several correlated lognormally distributed variables
  (Lo 2013 <doi:10.12988/ams.2013.39511>).
