title: Estimating Frequencies, Prevalence and Multiplicity of Infection
maintainer: Meraj Hashemi
description: The implemented methods reach out to scientists that seek to estimate
  multiplicity of infection (MOI) and lineage (allele) frequencies and prevalences
  at molecular markers using the maximum-likelihood method described in Schneider
  (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0194148>, and Schneider and Escalante (2014) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097899>.
  Users can import data from Excel files in various formats, and perform maximum-likelihood
  estimation on the imported data by the package's moimle() function.
