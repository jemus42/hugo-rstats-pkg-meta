title: Quick Access to Homologene and Gene Annotation Updates
maintainer: Ogan Mancarci
description: |-
  A wrapper for the homologene database by the National Center for
  Biotechnology Information ('NCBI'). It allows searching for gene homologs across
  species. Data in this package can be found at <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/>.
  The package also includes an updated version of the homologene database where
  gene identifiers and symbols are replaced with their latest (at the time of
  submission) version and functions to fetch latest annotation data to keep updated.
