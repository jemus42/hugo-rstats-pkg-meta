title: Parametric Survival Simulation with Parameter Uncertainty
maintainer: Kenta Yoshida
description: |-
  Perform survival simulation with parametric survival model generated from 'survreg' function in 'survival' package.
  In each simulation coefficients are resampled from variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates to
  capture uncertainty in model parameters.
  Prediction intervals of Kaplan-Meier estimates and hazard ratio of treatment effect can be further calculated using simulated survival data.
