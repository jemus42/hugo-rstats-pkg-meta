title: Adapt Numerical Records to Fit (in)Equality Restrictions
maintainer: Mark van der Loo
description: |-
  Minimally adjust the values of numerical records in a data.frame, such
  that each record satisfies a predefined set of equality and/or inequality
  constraints. The constraints can be defined using the 'validate' package.
  The core algorithms have recently been moved to the 'lintools' package,
  refer to 'lintools' for a more basic interface and access to a version
  of the algorithm that works with sparse matrices.
