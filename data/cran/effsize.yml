title: Efficient Effect Size Computation
maintainer: Marco Torchiano
description: |-
  A collection of functions to compute the standardized
  effect sizes for experiments (Cohen d, Hedges g, Cliff delta, Vargha-Delaney A).
  The computation algorithms have been optimized to allow efficient computation even
  with very large data sets.
