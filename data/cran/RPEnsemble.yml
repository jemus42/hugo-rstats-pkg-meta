title: Random Projection Ensemble Classification
maintainer: Timothy I. Cannings
description: Implements the methodology of "Cannings, T. I. and Samworth, R. J. (2017)
  Random-projection ensemble classification, J. Roy. Stat. Soc., Ser. B. (with discussion),
  79, 959--1035". The random projection ensemble classifier is a general method for
  classification of high-dimensional data, based on careful combination of the results
  of applying an arbitrary base classifier to random projections of the feature vectors
  into a lower-dimensional space. The random projections are divided into non-overlapping
  blocks, and within each block the projection yielding the smallest estimate of the
  test error is selected. The random projection ensemble classifier then aggregates
  the results of applying the base classifier on the selected projections, with a
  data-driven voting threshold to determine the final assignment.
