title: Statistical Patterns in Genomic Sequences
maintainer: Andrew Hart
description: |-
  A collection of statistical hypothesis tests and other
  techniques for identifying certain spatial relationships/phenomena in
  DNA sequences. In particular, it provides tests and graphical methods for determining
  whether or not DNA sequences comply with Chargaff's second parity rule
  or exhibit purine-pyrimidine parity. In addition, there are functions for
  efficiently simulating discrete state space Markov chains and testing
  arbitrary symbolic sequences of symbols for the presence of first-order
  Markovianness.
  Also, it has functions for counting words/k-mers (and cylinder patterns) in
  arbitrary symbolic sequences. Functions which take a DNA sequence as input
  can handle sequences stored as SeqFastadna objects from the 'seqinr' package.
