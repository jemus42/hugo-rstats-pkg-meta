  Gaussian Mixture Modeling Algorithms and the Belief-Based
  Mixture Modeling
maintainer: Przemyslaw Biecek
description: |-
  Two partially supervised mixture modeling methods:
  soft-label and belief-based modeling are implemented.
  For completeness, we equipped the package also with the
  functionality of unsupervised, semi- and fully supervised
  mixture modeling.  The package can be applied also to selection
  of the best-fitting from a set of models with different
  component numbers or constraints on their structures.
