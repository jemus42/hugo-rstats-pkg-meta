title: Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics Data
maintainer: Thomas W. D. MÃ¶bius
description: |-
  Provides methods for making inference in isobaric labelled
  LC-MS/MS experiments, i.e. iTRAQ experiments. It provides a function that
  reasonably parses a CSV-export from Proteome Discoverer(TM) into a data
  frame that can be easily handled in R. Functions and methods are provided
  for quality control, filtering, norming, and the calculation of response
  variables for further analysis. The merging of multiple iTRAQ experiments
  with respect to a reference is also covered.
