title: Spectral Analysis Tools using the Multitaper Method
maintainer: Karim Rahim
description: Implements multitaper spectral analysis using discrete prolate spheroidal
  sequences (Slepians) and sine tapers. It includes an adaptive weighted multitaper
  spectral estimate, a coherence estimate, Thomson's Harmonic F-test, and complex
  demodulation. The Slepians sequences are generated efficiently using a tridiagonal
  matrix solution, and jackknifed confidence intervals are available for most estimates.
