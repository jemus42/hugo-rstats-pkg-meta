  Computation of the p-Value for the Exact Conditional
  Cochran-Armitage Trend Test
maintainer: Dominic Edelmann
description: |-
  Provides functions for computing the one-sided p-values of the Cochran-Armitage trend test
  statistic for the asymptotic and the exact conditional test. The computation of the p-value for the exact test
  is performed using an algorithm following an idea by Mehta, et al. (1992) <doi:10.2307/1390598>.
