description: |-
  Hansen's (1995) Covariate-Augmented
  Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test. The only required argument is y, the
  Tx1 time series to be tested. If no stationary covariate X is
  passed to the procedure, then an ordinary ADF test is
  performed. The p-values of the test are computed using the
  procedure illustrated in Lupi (2009).
