maintainer: Joe Thorley
description: |-
  Converts files to and from flobs.
  A flob is a file that was
  read into binary in integer-mode as little endian,
  saved as the single element of a named list (where the name is the name
  of the original file) and then serialized before being coerced into a blob.
  Flobs are useful for writing and reading files to and from databases.
