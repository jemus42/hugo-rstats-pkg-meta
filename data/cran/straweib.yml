title: Stratified Weibull Regression Model
maintainer: Xiangdong Gu
description: |-
  The main function is icweib(), which fits a stratified Weibull
  proportional hazards model for left censored, right censored, interval censored,
  and non-censored survival data. We parameterize the Weibull regression model
  so that it allows a stratum-specific baseline hazard function, but where the
  effects of other covariates are assumed to be constant across strata.
  Please refer to Xiangdong Gu, David Shapiro, Michael D. Hughes and
