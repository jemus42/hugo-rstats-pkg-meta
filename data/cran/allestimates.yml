title: Effect Estimates from All Models
maintainer: Zhiqiang Wang
description: |-
  Estimates and plots effect estimates from models with all possible
  combinations of a list of variables. It can be used for assessing treatment
  effects in clinical trials or risk factors in bio-medical and epidemiological
  research. Like Stata command 'confall' (Wang Z (2007) <doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203> ),
  'allestimates' calculates and stores all effect estimates, and plots them against p values or
  Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. It currently has functions for linear
  regression: all_lm(), logistic and Poisson regression: all_glm() and all_speedglm(),
  and Cox proportional hazards regression: all_cox().
