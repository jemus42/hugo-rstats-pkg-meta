title: IRT Separate Calibration Linking Methods
maintainer: Jonathan P. Weeks
description: |-
  Item response theory based methods are used to compute
  linking constants and conduct chain linking of unidimensional
  or multidimensional tests for multiple groups under a common
  item design.  The unidimensional methods include the Mean/Mean,
  Mean/Sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous
  (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and/or polytomous (graded response, partial
  credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice
  model) items.  The multidimensional methods include the least
  squares method and extensions of the Haebara and Stocking-Lord
  method using single or multiple dilation parameters for
  multidimensional extensions of all the unidimensional
  dichotomous and polytomous item response models.  The package
  also includes functions for importing item and/or ability
  parameters from common IRT software, conducting IRT true score
  and observed score equating, and plotting item response
  curves/surfaces, vector plots, information plots, and comparison
  plots for examining parameter drift.
