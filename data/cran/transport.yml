title: Computation of Optimal Transport Plans and Wasserstein Distances
maintainer: Dominic Schuhmacher
description: Solve optimal transport problems. Compute Wasserstein distances (a.k.a.
  Kantorovitch, Fortet--Mourier, Mallows, Earth Mover's, or minimal L_p distances),
  return the corresponding transference plans, and display them graphically. Objects
  that can be compared include grey-scale images, (weighted) point patterns, and mass
  vectors.
