title: Delineating Temporal Dataset Shifts in Electronic Health Records
maintainer: Carlos Sáez
description: |-
  Functions to delineate temporal dataset shifts in Electronic Health
  Records through the projection and visualization of dissimilarities
  among data temporal batches. This is done through the estimation of
  data statistical distributions over time and their projection in
  non-parametric statistical manifolds, uncovering the patterns of the
  data latent temporal variability. 'EHRtemporalVariability' is
  particularly suitable for multi-modal data and categorical variables
  with a high number of values, common features of biomedical data where
  traditional statistical process control or time-series methods may not
  be appropriate. 'EHRtemporalVariability' allows you to explore and
  identify dataset shifts through visual analytics formats such as
  Data Temporal heatmaps and Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots.
  An additional 'EHRtemporalVariability' Shiny app can be used to load
  and explore the package results and even to allow the use of these
  functions to those users non-experienced in R coding. Preprint published
  in medRxiv (Sáez et al. 2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.04.07.20056564>.
