title: Integration of Multiple Data Sets with Clustering Techniques
maintainer: Marijke Van Moerbeke
description: Several integrative data methods in which information of objects from
  different data sources can be combined are included in the IntClust package. As
  a single data source is limited in its point of view, this provides more insight
  and the opportunity to investigate how the variables are interconnected. Clustering
  techniques are to be applied to the combined information. For now, only agglomerative
  hierarchical clustering is implemented. Further, differential gene expression and
  pathway analysis can be conducted on the clusters. Plotting functions are available
  to visualize and compare results of the different methods.
