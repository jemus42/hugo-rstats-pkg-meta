title: Parametric G-Formula
maintainer: Sean McGrath
description: |-
  Implements the parametric g-formula algorithm of Robins (1986)
  <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6>. The g-formula can be used to estimate
  the causal effects of hypothetical time-varying treatment interventions on
  the mean or risk of an outcome from longitudinal data with time-varying
  confounding. This package allows: 1) binary or continuous/multi-level
  time-varying treatments; 2) different types of outcomes (survival or
  continuous/binary end of follow-up); 3) data with competing events or
  truncation by death and loss to follow-up and other types of censoring
  events; 4) different options for handling competing events in the case of
  survival outcomes; 5) a random measurement/visit process; 6) joint
  interventions on multiple treatments; and 7) general incorporation of a
  priori knowledge of the data structure.
