title: Integrated Tool for Hairping Extraction of RNA Sequences
maintainer: Cristian Yones
description: Simple and integrated tool that automatically extracts and folds all
  hairpin sequences from raw genome-wide data. It predicts the secondary structure
  of several overlapped segments, with longer length than the mean length of sequences
  of interest for the species under processing, ensuring that no one is lost nor inappropriately
  cut.
