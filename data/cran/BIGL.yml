title: Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe Model
maintainer: Maxim Nazarov
description: |-
  Response surface methods for drug synergy analysis. Available
  methods include generalized and classical Loewe formulations as well as Highest
  Single Agent methodology. Response surfaces can be plotted in an interactive
  3-D plot and formal statistical tests for presence of synergistic effects are
  available. Implemented methods and tests are described in the article
  "BIGL: Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe null model for prediction
  of the expected combined effect compatible with partial agonism and antagonism"
