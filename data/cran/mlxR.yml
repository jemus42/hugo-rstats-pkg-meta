title: Simulation of Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Marc Lavielle
description: |-
  Simulation and visualization of complex
  models for longitudinal data. The models are encoded using the model coding
  language 'Mlxtran' and automatically converted into C++ codes.
  That allows one to implement very easily complex ODE-based models and complex
  statistical models, including mixed effects models, for continuous, count,
  categorical, and time-to-event data.
