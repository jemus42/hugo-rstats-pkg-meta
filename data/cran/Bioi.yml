title: Biological Image Analysis
maintainer: Zachary Colburn
description: Single linkage clustering and connected component analyses are often
  performed on biological images. 'Bioi' provides a set of functions for performing
  these tasks. This functionality is implemented in several key functions that can
  extend to from 1 to many dimensions. The single linkage clustering method implemented
  here can be used on n-dimensional data sets, while connected component analyses
  are limited to 3 or fewer dimensions.
