title: Bayesian Evaluation of Variant Involvement in Mendelian Disease
maintainer: Daniel Greene
description: A fast integrative genetic association test for rare diseases based on
  a model for disease status given allele counts at rare variant sites. Probability
  of association, mode of inheritance and probability of pathogenicity for individual
  variants are all inferred in a Bayesian framework - 'A Fast Association Test for
  Identifying Pathogenic Variants Involved in Rare Diseases', Greene et al 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.05.015>.
