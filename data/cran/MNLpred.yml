title: Simulated Predicted Probabilities for Multinomial Logit Models
maintainer: Manuel Neumann
description: |-
  Functions to easily return simulated predicted probabilities and
  first differences for multinomial logit models. It takes a specified
  scenario and a multinomial model to predict probabilities with a set of
  coefficients, drawn from a simulated sampling distribution. The simulated
  predictions allow for meaningful plots with means and confidence intervals.
  The methodological approach is based on the principles laid out by King,
  Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) <doi:10.2307/2669316>.
