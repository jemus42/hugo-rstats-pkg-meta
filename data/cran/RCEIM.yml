title: R Cross Entropy Inspired Method for Optimization
maintainer: Alberto Krone-Martins
description: An implementation of a stochastic heuristic method for performing multidimensional
  function optimization. The method is inspired in the Cross-Entropy Method. It does
  not relies on derivatives, neither imposes particularly strong requirements into
  the function to be optimized. Additionally, it takes profit from multi-core processing
  to enable optimization of time-consuming functions.
