description: |-
  CODATA internationally recommended values of the fundamental physical
  constants, provided as symbols for direct use within the R language. Optionally,
  the values with errors and/or the values with units are also provided if the
  'errors' and/or the 'units' packages are installed. The Committee on Data
  for Science and Technology (CODATA) is an interdisciplinary committee of the
  International Council for Science which periodically provides the internationally
  accepted set of values of the fundamental physical constants. This package
  contains the "2014 CODATA" version, published on 25 June 2015:
  Mohr, P. J., Newell, D. B. and Taylor, B. N. (2016)
