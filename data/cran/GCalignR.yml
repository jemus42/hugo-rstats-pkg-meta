title: Simple Peak Alignment for Gas-Chromatography Data
maintainer: Meinolf Ottensmann
description: |-
  Aligns peak based on peak retention times and matches homologous peaks
  across samples. The underlying alignment procedure comprises three sequential steps.
  (1) Full alignment of samples by linear transformation of retention times to
  maximise similarity among homologous peaks (2) Partial alignment of peaks within
  a user-defined retention time window to cluster homologous peaks (3) Merging rows
  that are likely representing homologous substances (i.e. no sample shows peaks in
  both rows and the rows have similar retention time means). The algorithm is described in detail
  in Ottensmann et al., 2018 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0198311>.
