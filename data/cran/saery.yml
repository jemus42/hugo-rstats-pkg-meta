title: Small Area Estimation for Rao and Yu Model
maintainer: Agustin Perez Martin
description: A complete set of functions to calculate several EBLUP (Empirical Best
  Linear Unbiased Predictor) estimators and their mean squared errors. All estimators
  are based on an area-level linear mixed model introduced by Rao and Yu in 1994 (see
  documentation). The REML method is used for fitting this model.
