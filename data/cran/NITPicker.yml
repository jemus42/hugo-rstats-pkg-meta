title: Finds the Best Subset of Points to Sample
maintainer: Daphne Ezer
description: |-
  Given a few examples of experiments over a time (or spatial) course,
  'NITPicker' selects a subset of points to sample in follow-up experiments,
  which would (i) best distinguish between the experimental conditions and the
  control condition (ii) best distinguish between two models of how the
  experimental condition might differ from the control (iii) a combination of
  the two. Ezer and Keir (2018) <doi:10.1101/301796>.
