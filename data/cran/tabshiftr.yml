title: Reshape Disorganised Messy Data
maintainer: Steffen Ehrmann
description: |-
  Helps the user to build and register schema descriptions of
  disorganised (messy) tables. Disorganised tables are tables that are
  not in a topologically coherent form, where packages such as 'tidyr' could
  be used for reshaping. The schema description documents the arrangement of
  input tables and is used to reshape them into a standardised (tidy) output
  format.
