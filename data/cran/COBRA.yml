title: Nonlinear Aggregation of Predictors
maintainer: Benjamin Guedj
description: 'This package performs prediction for regression-oriented problems, aggregating
  in a nonlinear scheme any basic regression machines suggested by the context and
  provided by the user. If the user has no valuable knowledge on the data, four defaults
  machines wrappers are implemented so as to cover a minimal spectrum of prediction
  methods. If necessary, the computations may be parallelized. The method is described
  in Biau, Fischer, Guedj and Malley (2013), "COBRA: A Nonlinear Aggregation Strategy".'
