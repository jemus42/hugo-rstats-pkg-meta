description: Efficient procedures for fitting the DD-PCA (Ke et al., 2019, <arXiv:1906.00051>)  by
  decomposing a large covariance matrix into a low-rank matrix plus a diagonally dominant
  matrix. The implementation of DD-PCA includes the convex approach using the Alternating
  Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and the non-convex approach using the iterative
  projection algorithm. Applications of DD-PCA to large covariance matrix estimation
  and global multiple testing are also included in this package.
