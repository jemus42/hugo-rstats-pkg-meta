title: Multivariate Dependence Modeling with Vines
maintainer: Yasser Gonzalez-Fernandez
description: |-
  Implementation of the vine graphical model for building
  high-dimensional probability distributions as a factorization of
  bivariate copulas and marginal density functions. This package
  provides S4 classes for vines (C-vines and D-vines) and methods
  for inference, goodness-of-fit tests, density/distribution
  function evaluation, and simulation.
