title: Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data
maintainer: Dave Hunter
description: |-
  Provides several methods for generating density functions
  based on binned data. Methods include step function, recursive
  subdivision, and optimized spline. Data are assumed to be nonnegative,
  the top bin is assumed to have no upper bound, but the bin widths need
  be equal. All PDF smoothing methods maintain the areas specified by
  the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF smoothing methods interpolate
  the points specified by the binned data.) In practice, an estimate for
  the mean of the distribution should be supplied as an optional argument.
  Doing so greatly improves the reliability of statistics computed from
  the smoothed density functions. Includes methods for estimating the Gini
  coefficient, the Theil index, percentiles, and random deviates from a
  smoothed distribution. Among the three methods, the optimized spline
  (splinebins) is recommended for most purposes. The percentile and
  random-draw methods should be regarded as experimental, and these methods
  only support splinebins.
