title: Check the Heaviness of Package Dependencies
maintainer: Zuguang Gu
description: |-
  It checks the heaviness of the packages that user's
  package depends on. For each package listed in the "Depends", "Imports" and
  "Suggests" fields in the DESCRIPTION file, it opens a new R session, loads the
  package and counts the number of namespaces that are loaded. The summary of
  the dependencies is visualized by a customized heatmap. Examples of dependency
  analysis can be found at <https://jokergoo.github.io/pkgndep/stat/>.
