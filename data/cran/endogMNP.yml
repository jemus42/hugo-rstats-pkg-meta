title: R Package for Fitting Multinomial Probit Models with Endogenous<U+000a>Selection
maintainer: Lane F. Burgette
description: endogMNP is an R package that fits a Bayesian multinomial<U+000a>probit
  model with endogenous selection, which is sometimes<U+000a>called an endogenous
  switching model.  This can be used to<U+000a>model discrete choice data when respondents
  select themselves<U+000a>into one of several groups.  This package is based on the
  MNP<U+000a>package by Kosuke Imai and David A. van Dyk.  This package<U+000a>modifies
  their code.
