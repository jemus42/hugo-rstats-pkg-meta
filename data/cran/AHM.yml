description: An implementation of the additive heredity model for the mixture-of-mixtures
  experiments of Shen et al. (2019) in Technometrics <doi:10.1080/00401706.2019.1630010>.
  The additive heredity model considers an additive structure to inherently connect
  the major components with the minor components. The additive heredity model has
  a meaningful interpretation for the estimated model because of the hierarchical
  and heredity principles applied and the nonnegative garrote technique used for variable
  selection.
