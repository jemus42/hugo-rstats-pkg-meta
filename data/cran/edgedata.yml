  a tidy format. These support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices' (CMS)
  risk adjustment Do-It-Yourself (DIY) process, which allows\nhealth insurance issuers
  to calculate member risk profiles under the Health\nand Human Services-Hierarchical
  Condition Categories (HHS-HCC) regression\nmodel. This regression model is used
  to calculate risk adjustment transfers.\nRisk adjustment is a selection mitigation
  program implemented under the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or
  Obamacare) in the USA.\nUnder the ACA, health insurance issuers submit claims data
  to CMS\tin order\nfor CMS to calculate a risk score under the HHS-HCC regression
  model.\nHowever, CMS does not inform issuers of their average risk score until after\nthe
  data submission deadline. These data sets can be used by issuers to\ncalculate their
  average risk score mid-year. More information about risk\nadjustment and the HHS-HCC
  model can be found here:\n<https://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a03.html>."
