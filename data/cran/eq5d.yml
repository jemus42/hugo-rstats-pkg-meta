title: Methods for Calculating 'EQ-5D' Utility Index Scores
maintainer: Fraser Morton
description: |-
  EQ-5D is a popular health related quality of life instrument used
  in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. Developed by the
  EuroQol group <https://www.euroqol.org>, the instrument consists of two
  components: health state description and evaluation. For the description
  component a subject self-rates their health in terms of five dimensions;
  mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and
  anxiety/depression using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L,
  <https://www.euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about>) or a five-level
  (EQ-5D-5L, <https://www.euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about>)
  scale. Frequently the scores on these five dimensions are converted to a
  single utility index using country specific value sets, which can be used
  in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in
  population health surveys. The eq5d package provides methods to calculate
  index scores from a subject's dimension scores. 25 TTO and 11 VAS EQ-5D-3L value
  sets including those for countries in Szende et al (2007)
  <doi:10.1007/1-4020-5511-0> and Szende et al (2014)
  <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1>, 20 EQ-5D-5L EQ-VT value sets from the EuroQol
  website, and the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk value sets developed by van Hout et al. (2012)
  <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008> are included. Additionally, a shiny web tool is
  included to enable the calculation, visualisation and automated statistical
  analysis of EQ-5D index values via a web browser using EQ-5D dimension scores
  stored in CSV or Excel files.
