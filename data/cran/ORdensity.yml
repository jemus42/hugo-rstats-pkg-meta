title: Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes
maintainer: José María Martínez Otzeta
description: 'Automated discovery of differentially expressed genes. The method (called
  ORdensity) is composed of two phases: discovering potential differentially expressed
  genes and recognizing differentially expressed genes. It makes use of a permutation
  resampling procedure to build outlying and density indexes. References: a) Irigoien,
