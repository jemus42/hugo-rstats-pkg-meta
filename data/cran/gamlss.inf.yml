title: Fitting Mixed (Inflated and Adjusted) Distributions
maintainer: Marco Enea
description: This is an add-on package to 'gamlss'. The purpose of this package is
  to allow users to fit GAMLSS (Generalised Additive Models for Location Scale and
  Shape) models when the response variable is defined either in the intervals [0,1),
  (0,1] and [0,1] (inflated at zero and/or one distributions), or in the positive
  real line including zero (zero-adjusted distributions). The mass points at zero
  and/or one are treated as extra parameters with the possibility to include a linear
  predictor for both. The package also allows transformed or truncated distributions
  from the GAMLSS family to be used for the continuous part of the distribution. Standard
  methods and GAMLSS diagnostics can be used with the resulting fitted object.
