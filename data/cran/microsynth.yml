title: Synthetic Control Methods with Micro- And Meso-Level Data
maintainer: Michael Robbins
description: |-
  A generalization of the 'Synth' package that is designed
  for data at a more granular level (e.g., micro-level). Provides
  functions to construct weights (including propensity score-type
  weights) and run analyses for synthetic control methods with
  micro- and meso-level data; see Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer
  (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1213634>.
