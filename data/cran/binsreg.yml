title: Binscatter Estimation and Inference
maintainer: Yingjie Feng
description: Provides tools for statistical analysis using the binscatter methods
  developed by Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2019a) <arXiv:1902.09608> and Cattaneo,
  Crump, Farrell and Feng (2019b) <arXiv:1902.09615>. Binscatter provides a flexible
  way of describing the mean relationship between two variables based on partitioning/binning
  of the independent variable of interest. binsreg() implements binscatter estimation
  and robust (pointwise and uniform) inference of regression functions and derivatives
  thereof, with particular focus on constructing binned scatter plots. binsregtest()
  implements hypothesis testing procedures for parametric functional forms of and
  nonparametric shape restrictions on the regression function. binsregselect() implements
  data-driven procedures for selecting the number of bins for binscatter estimation.
  All the commands allow for covariate adjustment, smoothness restrictions and clustering.
