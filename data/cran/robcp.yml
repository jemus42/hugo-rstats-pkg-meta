title: Robust Change-Point Tests
maintainer: Sheila Goerz
description: Provides robust methods to detect change-points in uni- or multivariate
  time series. They can cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. One can detect changes
  in location, scale and dependence structure of a possibly multivariate time series.
  Procedures are based on Huberized versions of CUSUM tests proposed in Duerre and
  Fried (2019) <arXiv:1905.06201>.
