title: Meta-Analysis of Generalized Additive Models
maintainer: Oystein Sorensen
description: |-
  Meta-analysis of generalized additive
  models and generalized additive mixed models. A typical use case is
  when data cannot be shared across locations, and an overall meta-analytic
  fit is sought. 'metagam' provides functionality for removing individual
  participant data from models computed using the 'mgcv' and 'gamm4' packages such
  that the model objects can be shared without exposing individual data.
  Furthermore, methods for meta-analysing these fits are provided. The implemented
  methods are described in Sorensen et al. (2020), <arXiv:2002.02627>,
  extending previous works by Schwartz and Zanobetti (2000)
  and Crippa et al. (2018) <doi:10.6000/1929-6029.2018.07.02.1>.
