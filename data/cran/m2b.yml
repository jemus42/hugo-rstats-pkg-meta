title: Movement to Behaviour Inference using Random Forest
maintainer: Laurent Dubroca
description: |-
  Prediction of behaviour from movement
  characteristics using observation and random forest for the analyses of movement
  data in ecology.
  From movement information (speed, bearing...) the model predicts the
  observed behaviour (movement, foraging...) using random forest. The
  model can then extrapolate behavioural information to movement data
  without direct observation of behaviours.
  The specificity of this method relies on the derivation of multiple predictor variables from the
  movement data over a range of temporal windows. This procedure allows to capture
  as much information as possible on the changes and variations of movement and
  ensures the use of the random forest algorithm to its best capacity. The method
  is very generic, applicable to any set of data providing movement data together with
  observation of behaviour.
