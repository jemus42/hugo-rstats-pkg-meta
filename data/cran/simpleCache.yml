title: Simply Caching R Objects
maintainer: Nathan Sheffield
description: |-
  Provides intuitive functions for caching R objects, encouraging
  reproducible, restartable, and distributed R analysis. The user selects a
  location to store caches, and then provides  nothing more than a cache name
  and instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object. Also
  provides some advanced options like environment assignments, recreating or
  reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings (using the 'batchtools'
  package) making it flexible enough for use in large-scale data analysis
  projects.
