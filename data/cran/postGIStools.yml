title: Tools for Interacting with 'PostgreSQL' / 'PostGIS' Databases
maintainer: Philippe Marchand
description: |-
  Functions to convert geometry and 'hstore' data types from
  'PostgreSQL' into standard R objects, as well as to simplify
  the import of R data frames (including spatial data frames) into 'PostgreSQL'.
  Note: This package is deprecated. For new projects, we recommend
  using the 'sf' package to interface with geodatabases.
