maintainer: Jonas Peters
description: 'The code computes the structural intervention distance (SID) between
  a true directed acyclic graph (DAG) and an estimated DAG. Definition and details
  about the implementation can be found in J. Peters and P. BÃ¼hlmann: "Structural
  intervention distance (SID) for evaluating causal graphs", Neural Computation 27,
  pages 771-799, 2015.'
