title: A Bin Packing Problem Solver
maintainer: Guang Yang
description: |-
  Basic infrastructure and several algorithms for 1d-4d bin packing
  problem. This package provides a set of c-level classes and solvers for
  1d-4d bin packing problem, and an r-level solver for 4d bin packing problem,
  which is a wrapper over the c-level 4d bin packing problem solver.
  The 4d bin packing problem solver aims to solve bin packing problem, a.k.a
  container loading problem, with an additional constraint on weight.
  Given a set of rectangular-shaped items, and a set of rectangular-shaped bins
  with weight limit, the solver looks for an orthogonal packing solution
  such that minimizes the number of bins and maximize volume utilization.
  Each rectangular-shaped item i = 1, .. , n is characterized by length l_i,
  depth d_i, height h_i, and weight w_i, and each rectangular-shaped bin
  j = 1, .. , m is specified similarly by length l_j, depth d_j, height h_j,
  and weight limit w_j.
  The item can be rotated into any orthogonal direction, and no further
  restrictions implied.
