  Genotyping and SNP Detection using Next Generation Sequencing
  Data
maintainer: Gongyi Huang<53hgy@163.com>
description: Genotyping the population using next generation sequencing data is essentially
  important for the rare variant detection. In order to distinguish the genomic structural
  variation from sequencing error, we propose a statistical model which involves the
  genotype effect through a latent variable to depict the distribution of non-reference
  allele frequency data among different samples and different genome loci, while decomposing
  the sequencing error into sample effect and positional effect. An ECM algorithm
  is implemented to estimate the model parameters, and then the genotypes and SNPs
  are inferred based on the empirical Bayes method.
