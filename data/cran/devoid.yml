title: A Graphic Device that Does Nothing
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  Provides a non-drawing graphic device for benchmarking purpose.
  In order to properly benchmark graphic drawing code it is necessary
  to factor out the device implementation itself so that results are not
  related to the specific graphics device used during benchmarking. The
  'devoid' package implements a graphic device that accepts all the required
  calls from R's graphic engine but performs no action. Apart from
  benchmarking it is unlikely that this device has any practical use.
