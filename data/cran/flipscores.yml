title: Robust Testing in GLMs
maintainer: Jesse Hemerik
description: |-
  Provides robust tests for testing in GLMs,
  by sign-flipping score contributions.
  The tests are often robust against overdispersion,
  heteroscedasticity and, in some cases,
  ignored nuisance variables.
  See Hemerik and Goeman (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11749-017-0571-1>.
