title: Functions for Optimal Non-Bipartite Matching
maintainer: Cole Beck
description: |-
  Perform non-bipartite matching and matched randomization. A
  "bipartite" matching utilizes two separate groups, e.g. smokers being
  matched to nonsmokers or cases being matched to controls. A "non-bipartite"
  matching creates mates from one big group, e.g. 100 hospitals being
  randomized for a two-arm cluster randomized trial or 5000 children who
  have been exposed to various levels of secondhand smoke and are being
  paired to form a greater exposure vs. lesser exposure comparison. At the
  core of a non-bipartite matching is a N x N distance matrix for N potential
  mates. The distance between two units expresses a measure of similarity or
  quality as mates (the lower the better). The 'gendistance()' and
  'distancematrix()' functions assist in creating this. The 'nonbimatch()'
  function creates the matching that minimizes the total sum of distances
  between mates; hence, it is referred to as an "optimal" matching. The
  'assign.grp()' function aids in performing a matched randomization. Note
  bipartite matching can be performed using the prevent option in
  'gendistance()'.
