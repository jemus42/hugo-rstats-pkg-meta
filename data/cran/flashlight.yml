maintainer: Michael Mayer
description: |-
  Shed light on black box machine learning models by
  the help of model performance, variable importance, global surrogate
  models, ICE profiles, partial dependence (Friedman J. H. (2001)
  <doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451>), accumulated local effects (Apley D. W.
  (2016) <arXiv:1612.08468>), further effects plots, scatter plots,
  interaction strength, and variable contribution breakdown (approximate
  SHAP) for single observations (Gosiewska and Biecek (2019)
  <arxiv:1903.11420>). All tools are implemented to work with case
  weights and allow for stratified analysis. Furthermore, multiple
  flashlights can be combined and analyzed together.
