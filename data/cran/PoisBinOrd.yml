maintainer: Ran Gao
description: |-
  Generation of multiple count, binary and ordinal variables simultaneously
  given the marginal characteristics and association structure. Throughout the package,
  the word 'Poisson' is used to imply count data under the assumption of Poisson distribution. The details of the method are explained in Amatya, A. and Demirtas, H. (2015) <DOI:10.1080/00949655.2014.953534>.
