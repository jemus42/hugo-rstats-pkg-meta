version: '2.10'
title: Model Selection and Post-hoc Analysis for (G)LMER Models
maintainer: '"Antoine Tremblay, Dalhousie University"'
description: The main function of the package is to perform backward selection of
  fixed effects, forward fitting of the random effects, and post-hoc analysis using
  parallel capabilities. Other functionality includes the computation of ANOVAs with
  upper- or lower-bound p-values and R-squared values for each model term, model criticism
  plots, data trimming on model residuals, and data visualization. The data to run
  examples is contained in package LCF_data.
