  A simple interface to build designs using the package 'DeclareDesign'.
  In one line of code, users can specify the parameters of individual
  designs and diagnose their properties. The designers can also be used
  to compare performance of a given design across a range of combinations
  of parameters, such as effect size, sample size, and assignment probabilities.
