description: Synthesize images into characteristic features for time-series analysis
  or machine learning applications.  The package was originally intended for monitoring
  volcanic eruptions in video data by highlighting and extracting regions above the
  vent associated with plume activity.  However, the functions within are general
  and have wide applications for image processing, analyzing, filtering, and plotting.
