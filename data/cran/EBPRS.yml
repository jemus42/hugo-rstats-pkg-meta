title: Derive Polygenic Risk Score Based on Emprical Bayes Theory
maintainer: Shuang Song
description: EB-PRS is a novel method that leverages information for effect sizes
  across all the markers to improve the prediction accuracy.  No parameter tuning
  is needed in the method, and no external information is needed. This R-package provides
  the calculation of polygenic risk scores from the given training summary statistics
  and testing data. We can use EB-PRS to extract main information, estimate Empirical
  Bayes parameters, derive polygenic risk scores for  each individual in testing data,
  and evaluate the PRS according to AUC and predictive r2. See Song et al. (2020)
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007565> for a detailed presentation of the method.
