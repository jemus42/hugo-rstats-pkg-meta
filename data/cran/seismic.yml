title: Predict Information Cascade by Self-Exciting Point Process
maintainer: Qingyuan Zhao
description: An implementation of self-exciting point process model for information
  cascades, which occurs when many people engage in the same acts after observing
  the actions of others (e.g. post resharings on Facebook or Twitter). It provides
  functions to estimate the infectiousness of an information cascade and predict its
  popularity given the observed history. See http://snap.stanford.edu/seismic/ for
  more information and datasets.
