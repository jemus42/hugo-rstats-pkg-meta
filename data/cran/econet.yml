title: Estimation of Parameter-Dependent Network Centrality Measures
maintainer: Valerio Leone Sciabolazza
description: Provides methods for estimating parameter-dependent network centrality
  measures with linear-in-means models. Both non linear least squares and maximum
  likelihood estimators are implemented. The methods allow for both link and node
  heterogeneity in network effects, endogenous network formation and the presence
  of unconnected nodes. The routines also compare the explanatory power of parameter-dependent
  network centrality measures with those of standard measures of network centrality.
  Benefits and features of the 'econet' package are illustrated using data from Battaglini
  and Patacchini (2018), which examine the determinants of US campaign contributions
  when legislators care about the behavior of other legislators to whom they are socially
  connected. For additional details, see the vignette.
