  Estimate Number of Latent Factors and Factor Matrix for Factor
  Analysis
maintainer: Jingshu Wang
description: These functions estimate the latent factors of a given matrix, no matter
  it is high-dimensional or not. It tries to first estimate the number of factors
  using bi-cross-validation and then estimate the latent factor matrix and the noise
  variances. For more information about the method, see Art B. Owen and Jingshu Wang
