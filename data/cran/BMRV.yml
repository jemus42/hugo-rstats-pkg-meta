title: Bayesian Models for Rare Variant Association Analysis
maintainer: Liang He
description: Provides two Bayesian models for detecting the association between rare
  genetic variants and a trait that can be continuous, ordinal or binary. Bayesian
  latent variable collapsing model (BLVCM) detects interaction effect and is dedicated
  to twin design while it can also be applied to independent samples. Hierarchical
  Bayesian multiple regression model (HBMR) incorporates genotype uncertainty information
  and can be applied to either independent or family samples. Furthermore, it deals
  with continuous, binary and ordinal traits.
