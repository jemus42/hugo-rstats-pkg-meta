title: Simulating Data to Study Performance of Clustering Algorithms
maintainer: Wei-Chen Chen
description: |-
  The utility of this package is in simulating mixtures of Gaussian
  distributions with different levels of overlap between mixture
  components.  Pairwise overlap, defined as a sum of two
  misclassification probabilities, measures the degree of
  interaction between components and can be readily employed to
  control the clustering complexity of datasets simulated from
  mixtures. These datasets can then be used for systematic
  performance investigation of clustering and finite mixture
  modeling algorithms. Among other capabilities of 'MixSim', there
  are computing the exact overlap for Gaussian mixtures,
  simulating Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, simulating outliers
  and noise variables, calculating various measures of agreement
  between two partitionings, and constructing parallel
  distribution plots for the graphical display of finite mixture
  models.
