  Outlier Detection Using the Iterated RMCD Method of Cerioli
  (2010)
maintainer: Christopher G. Green
description: |-
  Implements the iterated RMCD method of Cerioli (2010)
  for multivariate outlier detection via robust Mahalanobis distances. Also
  provides the finite-sample RMCD method discussed in the paper, as well as
  the methods provided in Hardin and Rocke (2005) <doi:10.1198/106186005X77685>
  and Green and Martin (2017).
