  A Double Bootstrap Method for Analyzing Linear Models with
  Autoregressive Errors
maintainer: Shaofeng Zhang
description: |-
  Computes the double bootstrap as discussed in McKnight, McKean, and Huitema (2000) <doi:10.1037/1082-989X.5.1.87>.
  The double bootstrap method provides a better fit for a linear model with autoregressive errors than ARIMA when the sample size is small.
