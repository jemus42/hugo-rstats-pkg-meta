title: Zero Order vs (Semi) Partial Correlation Test and CI
maintainer: Dan Richard
description: |-
  Uses bootstrap to test zero order correlation being equal to a
  partial or semi-partial correlation (one or two tailed). Confidence
  intervals for the parameter (zero order minus partial) can also be
  determined. Implements the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap
  method as described in "An Introduction to the Bootstrap" Efron (1983)
