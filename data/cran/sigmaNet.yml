title: Render Graphs Using 'Sigma.js'
maintainer: Ian Kloo
description: |-
  Create interactive graph visualizations using 'Sigma.js' <http://sigmajs.org/>.  This package is meant to be used in conjunction
  with 'igraph', replacing the (somewhat underwhelming) plotting features of the package.  The idea is to quickly render
  graphs, regardless of their size, in a way that allows for easy, iterative modification of aesthetics.  Because
  'Sigma.js' is a 'javascript' library, the visualizations are inherently interactive and are well suited for integration
  with 'Shiny' apps.  While there are several 'htmlwidgets' focused on network visualization, they tend to underperform on
  medium to large sized graphs.  'Sigma.js' was designed for larger network visualizations and this package aims to
  make those strengths available to 'R' users.
