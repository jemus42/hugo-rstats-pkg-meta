title: Model and Solve Mixed Integer Linear Programs
maintainer: Dirk Schumacher
description: |-
  Model mixed integer linear programs in an algebraic way directly in R.
  The model is solver-independent and thus offers the possibility
  to solve a model with different solvers. It currently only supports
  linear constraints and objective functions. See the 'ompr'
  website <https://dirkschumacher.github.io/ompr> for more information,
  documentation and examples.
