description: |-
  Functions for basic hydraulic calculations related to
  water flow in circular pipes flowing full (under pressure). This
  includes friction loss calculations by solving the Darcy-Weisbach
  equation for head loss, flow or diameter, and plotting a Moody diagram.
  The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is calculated using the Colebrook (or
  Colebrook-White equation), the basis of the Moody diagram, the original
  citation being Colebrook (1939) <doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150>. The
  derivation of the Darcy-Weisbach equation and methods for its solution
  are outlined in many fluid mechanics texts such as Finnemore and Franzini
  (2002, ISBN:978-0072432022). This package is designed to work similarly
  to the 'iemisc' package, but with an emphasis on pipe flow.
