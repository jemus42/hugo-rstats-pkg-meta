description: |-
  Analysis tool for evaluating benthic multimetric indices (BENMMIs).
  It generates reproducible reports on the analysis of benthic data, e.g.,
  validation and correction of species names, sample pooling, automatic
  conversion of genus to species names, outlier detection, benthic
  indicator calculation, optimization of single and
  multimetric indicators against a pressure gradient, and spatial aggregation
  of benthic indicators. One of its use cases was the development of a common
  benthic indicator for <https://www.ospar.org> (publication accepted by
  Ecological Indicators). See Van Loon et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.029> for details.
