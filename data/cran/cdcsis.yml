  Conditional Distance Correlation Based Feature Screening and
  Conditional Independence Inference
maintainer: Jin Zhu
description: Conditional distance correlation <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.993081> is
  a novel conditional dependence measurement of two multivariate random variables
  given a confounding variable. This package provides conditional distance correlation,
  performs the conditional distance correlation sure independence screening procedure
  for ultrahigh dimensional data <http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/J28N1/J28N114/J28N114.html>,
  and conducts conditional distance covariance test for conditional independence assumption
  of two multivariate variable.
