maintainer: Matthew Clegg
description: A time series is said to be partially autoregressive if it can be represented
  as a sum of a random walk and an autoregressive sequence without unit roots. This
  package fits partially autoregressive time series, where the autoregressive  component
  is AR(1).  This may be of use in modeling certain financial time series.
