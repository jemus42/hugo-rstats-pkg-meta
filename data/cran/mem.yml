  <doi:10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00422.x>, <doi:10.1111/irv.12330>, allows the weekly
  assessment of the epidemic and intensity status to help in routine respiratory infections
  surveillance in health systems. Allows the comparison of different epidemic indicators,

  method in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the alert week.
