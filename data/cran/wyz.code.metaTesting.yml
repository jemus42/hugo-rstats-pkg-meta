title: Wizardry Code Meta Testing
maintainer: Fabien Gelineau
description: |-
  Meta testing is the ability to test a function without having to
  provide its parameter values.
  Those values will be generated, based on semantic naming of parameters, as
  introduced by package 'wyz.code.offensiveProgramming'.
  Value generation logic can be completed with your own data types
  and generation schemes. This to meet your most specific requirements and to
  answer to a wide variety of usages, from general use case to very specific
  ones.
  While using meta testing, it becomes easier to generate stress test
  campaigns, non-regression test campaigns and robustness test campaigns, as
  generated tests can be saved and reused from session to session.
  Main benefits of using 'wyz.code.metaTesting' is ability to discover valid
  and invalid function parameter combinations, ability to infer valid
  parameter values, and to provide smart summaries that allows you to focus
  on dysfunctional cases.
