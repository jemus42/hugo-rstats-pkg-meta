  and Discriminant Analysis
maintainer: Mohammed Sedki
description: |-
  Performs a regularization approach to variable selection in the
  model-based clustering and classification frameworks.
  First, the variables are arranged in order with a lasso-like procedure.
  Second, the method of Maugis, Celeux, and Martin-Magniette (2009, 2011)
  <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2009.04.013>, <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2011.05.004>
  is adapted to define the role of variables in the two frameworks.
