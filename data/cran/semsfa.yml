maintainer: Giancarlo Ferrara
description: 'Semiparametric Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Models following a
  two step procedure: in the first step semiparametric or nonparametric regression
  techniques are used to relax parametric restrictions of the functional form representing
  technology and in the second step variance parameters are obtained by pseudolikelihood
  estimators or by method of moments.'
