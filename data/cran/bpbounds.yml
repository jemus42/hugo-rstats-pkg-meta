  Nonparametric Bounds for the Average Causal Effect Due to Balke
  and Pearl and Extensions
maintainer: Tom Palmer
description: |-
  Implementation of the nonparametric bounds for the average causal
  effect under an instrumental variable model by Balke and Pearl (Bounds on
  Treatment Effects from Studies with Imperfect Compliance, JASA, 1997, 92,
  439, 1171-1176). The package can calculate bounds for a binary outcome, a
  binary treatment/phenotype, and an instrument with either 2 or 3
  categories. The package implements bounds for situations where these 3
  variables are measured in the same dataset (trivariate data) or where the
  outcome and instrument are measured in one study and the
  treatment/phenotype and instrument are measured in another study
  (bivariate data).
