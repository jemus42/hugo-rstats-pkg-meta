title: Knowledge-Based Guided Regularized Random Forest
maintainer: Xin Guan
description: 'Random Forest (RF) and Regularized Random Forest can be used for feature
  selection. Moreover, by Guided Regularized Random Forest, statistical-based weights
  are used to guide the regularization of random forest and further used for feature
  selection. This package can integrate prior information from multiple domains (statistical
  based and knowledge domain) to guide the regularization of random forest and feature
  selection. For more details, see reference: Guan X., Liu L. (2018) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-78759-6_1>.'
