maintainer: Daniel Schalk
description: |-
  C++ implementation of component-wise boosting implementation of component-wise
  boosting written in C++ to obtain high runtime performance and full memory control. The main
  idea is to provide a modular class system which can be extended without editing the source code.
  Therefore, it is possible to use R functions as well as C++ functions for custom base-learners,
  losses, logging mechanisms or stopping criteria.
