title: Convenient Functions for Ensemble Time Series Forecasts
maintainer: David Shaub
description: |-
  Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
  approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(),
  thetaf(), nnetar(), stlm(), tbats(), and snaive() can be combined with equal weights, weights
  based on in-sample errors (introduced by Bates & Granger (1969) <doi:10.1057/jors.1969.103>),
  or cross-validated weights. Cross validation for time series data with user-supplied models
  and forecasting functions is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
