  Phase I Control Charts (with Emphasis on Distribution-Free
  Methods)
maintainer: Giovanna Capizzi
description: Statistical methods for retrospectively detecting changes in location
  and/or dispersion of univariate and multivariate variables. Data values are assumed
  to be independent, can be individual (one observation at each instant of time) or
  subgrouped (more than one observation at each instant of time). Control limits are
  computed, often using a permutation approach, so that a prescribed false alarm probability
  is guaranteed  without making any parametric assumptions on the stable (in-control)
  distribution.
