title: Nonlinear Nonparametric Statistics
maintainer: Fred Viole
description: 'Nonlinear nonparametric statistics using partial moments.  Partial moments
  are the elements of variance and asymptotically approximate the area of f(x).  These
  robust statistics provide the basis for nonlinear analysis while retaining linear
  equivalences.  NNS offers: Numerical integration, Numerical differentiation, Clustering,
  Correlation, Dependence, Causal analysis, ANOVA, Regression, Classification, Seasonality,
  Autoregressive modeling, Normalization and Stochastic dominance.  All routines based
  on: Viole, F. and Nawrocki, D. (2013), Nonlinear Nonparametric Statistics: Using
  Partial Moments (ISBN: 1490523995).'
