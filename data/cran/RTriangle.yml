title: Triangle - A 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
maintainer: David C. Sterratt
description: |-
  This is a port of Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library to
  R. From his description: "Triangle generates exact Delaunay
  triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming
  Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality
  triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or
  large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis."
