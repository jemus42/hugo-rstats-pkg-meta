title: Wavelet Analysis of Genomic Data from Admixed Populations
maintainer: Murray Cox
description: Implements wavelet-based approaches for describing population admixture.
  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to define the population structure and
  produce a localized admixture signal for each individual. Wavelet summaries of the
  PCA output describe variation present in the data and can be related to population-level
  demographic processes. For more details, see J Sanderson, H Sudoyo, TM Karafet,
  MF Hammer and MP Cox. 2015. Reconstructing past admixture processes from local genomic
  ancestry using wavelet transformation. Genetics 200:469-481 <doi:10.1534/genetics.115.176842>.
