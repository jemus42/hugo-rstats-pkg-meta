  Longitudinal Gene Expression Data
maintainer: Jiehuan Sun
description: Longitudinal genomics data and survival outcome are common in biomedical
  studies. It is of great interest to select genes related to the survival outcome.
  LCox is a computationally efficient tool for selecting genes related to the survival
  outcome using the longitudinal genomics data. LCox is powerful to detect different
  forms of dependence between the longitudinal biomarkers and the survival outcome.
