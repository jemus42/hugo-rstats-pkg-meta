  Extreme Value Theory for Open Set Classification - GPD and GEV
  Classifiers
maintainer: Edoardo Vignotto
description: Two classifiers for open set recognition and novelty detection based
  on extreme value theory. The first classifier is based on the generalized Pareto
  distribution (GPD) and the second classifier is based on the generalized extreme
  value (GEV) distribution. For details, see Vignotto, E., & Engelke, S. (2018) <arXiv:1808.09902>.
