title: Target Equivalence Range Design
maintainer: M. Suzette Blanchard
description: The TEQR package contains software to calculate the operating characteristics
  for the TEQR and the ACT designs.The TEQR (toxicity equivalence range) design is
  a toxicity based cumulative cohort design with added safety rules. The ACT (Activity
  constrained for toxicity) design  is also a cumulative cohort design with additional
  safety rules. The unique feature of this design is that dose is escalated based
  on lack of activity rather than on lack of toxicity and is de-escalated only if
  an unacceptable level of toxicity is experienced.
