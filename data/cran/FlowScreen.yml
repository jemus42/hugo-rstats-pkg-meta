title: Daily Streamflow Trend and Change Point Screening
maintainer: Jennifer Dierauer
description: |-
  Screens daily streamflow time series for temporal trends and
  change-points. This package has been primarily developed for assessing the
  quality of daily streamflow time series. It also contains tools for plotting
  and calculating many different streamflow metrics. The package can be used to
  produce summary screening plots showing change-points and significant temporal
  trends for high flow, low flow, and/or baseflow statistics, or it can be used
  to perform more detailed hydrological time series analyses. The package was
  designed for screening daily streamflow time series from Water Survey Canada
  and the United States Geological Survey but will also work with streamflow time
  series from many other agencies.
