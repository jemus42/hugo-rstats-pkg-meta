description: A tidy framework for automatic knowledge classification and visualization.
  Currently, the core functionality of the framework is mainly supported by modularity-based
  clustering (community detection) in keyword co-occurrence network, and focuses on
  co-word analysis of bibliometric research. However, the designed functions in 'akc'
  are general, and could be extended to solve other tasks in text mining as well.
