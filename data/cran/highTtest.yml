title: Simultaneous Critical Values for t-Tests in Very High Dimensions
maintainer: Shannon Holloway
description: Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011) for the significance
  analysis of thousands of features in high-dimensional biological studies. It is
  an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure to find critical values for rejection
  regions controlling the k-familywise error rate, false discovery rate, and the tail
  probability of false discovery proportion.
