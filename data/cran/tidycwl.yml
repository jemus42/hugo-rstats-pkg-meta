title: Tidy Common Workflow Language Tools and Workflows
maintainer: Nan Xiao
description: |-
  The Common Workflow Language <https://www.commonwl.org/> is an
  open standard for describing data analysis workflows. This package takes
  the raw Common Workflow Language workflows encoded in JSON or 'YAML'
  and turns the workflow elements into tidy data frames or lists.
  A graph representation for the workflow can be constructed and visualized
  with the parsed workflow inputs, outputs, and steps. Users can embed the
  visualizations in their 'Shiny' applications, and export them
  as HTML files or static images.
