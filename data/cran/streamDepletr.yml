title: Estimate Streamflow Depletion Due to Groundwater Pumping
maintainer: Samuel C. Zipper
description: |-
  Implementation of analytical models for estimating streamflow
  depletion due to groundwater pumping, and other related tools. Functions
  are broadly split into two groups: (1) analytical streamflow depletion
  models, which estimate streamflow depletion for a single stream reach
  resulting from groundwater pumping; and (2) depletion apportionment
  equations, which distribute estimated streamflow depletion among multiple
  stream reaches within a stream network. See Zipper et al. (2018) <doi:10.1029/2018WR022707>
  for more information on depletion apportionment equations and Zipper et
  al. (2019) <doi:10.1029/2018WR024403> for more information on analytical
  depletion functions, which combine analytical models and depletion apportionment
  equations.
