title: Nominal Dates, Times, and Durations
maintainer: Tim Bergsma
description: |-
  Provides methods for working with nominal dates, times, and
  durations. Base R has sophisticated facilities for handling time, but these
  can give unexpected results if, for example, timezone is not handled properly.
  This package provides a more casual approach to support cases which
  do not require rigorous treatment.  It systematically deconstructs the
  concepts origin and timezone, and de-emphasizes the display of seconds. It
  also converts among nominal durations such as seconds, hours, days, and weeks.
  See '?datetime' and '?duration' for examples. Adapted from 'metrumrg'
