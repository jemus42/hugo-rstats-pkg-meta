title: Simulation of Weed Population Dynamics
maintainer: Christoph v. Redwitz
description: |-
  An environment to simulate the development of annual plant populations with regard to population dynamics and genetics, especially herbicide resistance. It combines genetics on the individual level (Renton et al. 2011) with a stochastic development on the population level (Daedlow, 2015).
