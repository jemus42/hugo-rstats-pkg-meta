title: Predict Antimicrobial Peptides
maintainer: Legana Fingerhut
description: |-
  A toolkit to predict antimicrobial peptides from protein sequences on a genome-wide scale.
  It incorporates two support vector machine models ("precursor" and "mature") trained on publicly available antimicrobial peptide data using calculated
  physico-chemical and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al. (2017) <doi:10.1038/srep42362>.
  In order to support genome-wide analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of protein as input
  and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised for high-throughput use. For details see Fingerhut et al. 2020 <doi:10.1101/2020.05.07.082412>.
