  Effect Modification in Observational Studies Using the Submax
  Method
maintainer: Paul R. Rosenbaum
description: Effect modification occurs if a treatment effect is larger or more stable
  in certain subgroups defined by observed covariates.  The submax or subgroup-maximum
  method of Lee et al. (2017) <arXiv:1702.00525> does an overall test and separate
  tests in subgroups, correcting for multiple testing using the joint distribution.
