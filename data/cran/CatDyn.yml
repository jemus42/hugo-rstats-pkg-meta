title: Fishery Stock Assessment by Catch Dynamics Models
maintainer: Ruben H. Roa-Ureta
description: Based on fishery Catch Dynamics instead of fish Population Dynamics (hence
  CatDyn) and using high-frequency or medium-frequency catch in biomass or numbers,
  fishing nominal effort, and mean fish body weight by time step, from one or two
  fishing fleets, estimate stock abundance, natural mortality rate, and fishing operational
  parameters. It includes methods for data organization, plotting standard exploratory
  and analytical plots, predictions, for 100 types of models of increasing complexity,
  and 72 likelihood models for the data.
