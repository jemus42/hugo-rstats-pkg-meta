  Linear Mixed Effect Model Splines for Modelling and Analysis of
  Time Course Data
maintainer: Jasmin Straube
description: |-
  Linear Mixed effect Model Splines ('lmms') implements linear mixed
  effect model splines for modelling and differential expression for highly
  dimensional data sets: investNoise() for quality control and filterNoise() for
  removing non-informative trajectories; lmmSpline() to model time course expression
  profiles and lmmsDE() performs differential expression analysis to identify
  differential expression between groups, time and/or group x time interaction.
