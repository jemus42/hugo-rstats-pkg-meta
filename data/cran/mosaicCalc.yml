  Function-Based Numerical and Symbolic Differentiation and
  Antidifferentiation
maintainer: Daniel Kaplan
description: |-
  Part of the Project MOSAIC (<http://mosaic-web.org/>)
  suite that provides utility functions for doing calculus
  (differentiation and integration) in R. The main differentiation and
  antidifferentiation operators are described using formulas and return functions
  rather than numerical values. Numerical values can be obtained by evaluating
  these functions.
