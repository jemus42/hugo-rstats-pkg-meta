  Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Robust Random Fields for
  Spatiotemporal Modeling
maintainer: Sean C. Anderson
description: |-
  Implements Bayesian spatial and spatiotemporal models that
  optionally allow for extreme spatial deviations through time. 'glmmfields'
  uses a predictive process approach with random fields implemented through
  a multivariate-t distribution instead of the usual multivariate normal.
  Sampling is conducted with 'Stan'. References: Anderson and Ward (2019)
