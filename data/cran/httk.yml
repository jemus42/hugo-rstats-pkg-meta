description: |-
  Functions and data tables for simulation and statistical analysis
  of chemical toxicokinetics ("TK") as in Pearce et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04>. Chemical-specific in vitro
  data have been obtained from relatively high throughput
  experiments. Both physiologically-based ("PBTK") and empirical
  (e.g., one compartment) "TK" models can be parameterized for
  several hundred chemicals and multiple species. These models are
  solved efficiently, often using compiled (C-based) code. A Monte
  Carlo sampler is included for simulating biological variability
  (Ring et al., 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004>)
  and measurement limitations. Calibrated methods are included for
  predicting tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of
  distribution
  (Pearce et al., 2017 <doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7>).
  These functions and data provide a set of tools for
  in vitro-in vivo extrapolation ("IVIVE") of high throughput
  screening data (e.g., Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via
  reverse dosimetry (also known as "RTK")
  (Wetmore et al., 2015 <doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171>).
