title: Omnidirectional R Code Snippets
maintainer: Florian Detsch
description: |-
  I tend to repeat the same code chunks over and over again. At
  first, this was fine for me and I paid little attention to such redundancies.
  A little later, when I got tired of manually replacing Linux filepaths with
  the referring Windows versions, and vice versa, I started to stuff some very
  frequently used work-steps into functions and, even later, into a proper R
  package. And that's what this package is - a hodgepodge of various R functions
  meant to simplify (my) everyday-life coding work without, at the same time,
  being devoted to a particular scope of application.
