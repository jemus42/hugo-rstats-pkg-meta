  Patterns and Statistical Differences Between Two Groups of
  Strings
maintainer: Hui (Tom) Tang
description: |-
  Methods include converting series of event names to strings, finding common patterns
  in a group of strings, discovering featured patterns when comparing two groups of strings as well
  as the number and starting position of each pattern in each string, obtaining transition matrix,
  computing transition entropy, statistically comparing the difference between two groups of strings,
  and clustering string groups. Event names can be any action names or labels such as events in log
  files or areas of interest (AOIs) in eye tracking research.
