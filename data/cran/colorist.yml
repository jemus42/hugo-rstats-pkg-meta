title: Coloring Wildlife Distributions in Space-Time
maintainer: Matthew Strimas-Mackey
description: |-
  Color and visualize wildlife distributions in
  space-time using raster data. In addition to enabling display of
  sequential change in distributions through the use of small multiples,
  'colorist' provides functions for extracting several features of
  interest from a sequence of distributions and for visualizing those
  features using HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color palettes. Resulting
  maps allow for "fair" visual comparison of intensity values (e.g.,
  occurrence, abundance, or density) across space and time and can be
  used to address questions about where, when, and how consistently a
  species, group, or individual is likely to be found.
