description: |-
  The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB,<http://
  www.bmrb.wisc.edu/>) collects, annotates, archives, and disseminates (worldwide
  in the public domain) the important spectral and quantitative data derived
  from NMR(Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopic investigations of biological
  macromolecules and metabolites. This package provides an interface to BMRB
  database for easy data access and includes a minimal set of data visualization
  functions. Users are encouraged to make their own data visualizations using BMRB
  data.
