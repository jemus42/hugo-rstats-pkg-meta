title: Simulating Survival Data from Change-Point Hazard Distributions
maintainer: Camille Hochheimer
description: |-
  Simulates time-to-event data
  with type I right censoring using two methods: the inverse CDF
  method and our proposed memoryless method. The latter method
  takes advantage of the memoryless property of survival and
  simulates a separate distribution between change-points. We
  include two parametric distributions: exponential and Weibull.
  Inverse CDF method draws on the work of Rainer Walke (2010),
