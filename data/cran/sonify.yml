title: Data Sonification - Turning Data into Sound
maintainer: Stefan Siegert
description: Sonification (or audification) is the process of representing data by
  sounds in the audible range. This package provides the R function sonify() that
  transforms univariate data, sampled at regular or irregular intervals, into a continuous
  sound with time-varying frequency. The ups and downs in frequency represent the
  ups and downs in the data. Sonify provides a substitute for R's plot function to
  simplify data analysis for the visually impaired.
