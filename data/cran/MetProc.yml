  Separate Metabolites into Likely Measurement Artifacts and True
  Metabolites

description: |-
  Split an untargeted metabolomics data set into a set of likely true
  metabolites and a set of likely measurement artifacts. This process involves
  comparing missing rates of pooled plasma samples and biological samples. The
  functions assume a fixed injection order of samples where biological samples are
  randomized and processed between intermittent pooled plasma samples. By comparing
  patterns of missing data across injection order, metabolites that appear in blocks
  and are likely artifacts can be separated from metabolites that seem to have
  random dispersion of missing data. The two main metrics used are: 1. the number of
  consecutive blocks of samples with present data and 2. the correlation of missing rates
  between biological samples and flanking pooled plasma samples.
