  LIME-Based Explanations with Interpretable Inputs Based on
  Ceteris Paribus Profiles
maintainer: Mateusz Staniak
description: |-
  Local explanations of machine learning models describe, how features contributed to a single prediction.
  This package implements an explanation method based on LIME
  (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations,
  see Tulio Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939778>) in which interpretable
  inputs are created based on local rather than global behaviour of each original feature.
