title: Implements the MixMAP Algorithm
maintainer: Gregory J. Matthews
description: |-
  A collection of functions to implement the MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene
  level tests of association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a
  meta-analysis of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are detected as
  significant if the collection of p-values within a gene are determined to
  be collectively smaller than would be observed by chance.
