maintainer: David J. Harris
description: Tools for assessing exotic species' contributions to<U+000a>landscape
  homogeneity using average pairwise Jaccard similarity<U+000a>and an analytical approximation
  derived in Harris et al. (2011,<U+000a>"Occupancy is nine-tenths of the law," The
  American<U+000a>Naturalist). Also includes a randomization method for assessing<U+000a>sources
  of model error.
