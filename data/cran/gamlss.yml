description: Functions for fitting the Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale
  and Shape introduced by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005), <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x>.
  The models use a distributional regression approach where all the parameters of
  the conditional distribution of the response variable are modelled using explanatory
  variables.
