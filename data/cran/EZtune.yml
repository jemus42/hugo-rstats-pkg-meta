description: |-
  Contains two functions that are intended to make
  tuning supervised learning methods easy. The eztune function uses a
  genetic algorithm or Hooke-Jeeves optimizer to find the best
  set of tuning parameters. The user can choose the optimizer, the
  learning method, and if optimization will be based on accuracy
  obtained through validation error, cross validation, or resubstitution.
  The function eztune.cv will compute a cross validated error rate. The purpose
  of eztune_cv is to provide a cross validated accuracy or MSE when
  resubstitution or validation data are used for optimization because
  error measures from both approaches can be misleading.
