title: Calculation of Low Flow Statistics for Daily Stream Flow Data
maintainer: Tobias Gauster
description: |-
  The "Manual on Low-flow Estimation and Prediction", published by
  the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), gives a comprehensive summary on
  how to analyse stream flow data focusing on low-flows. This packages provides
  functions to compute the described statistics and produces plots similar to the
  ones in the manual.
