title: Inhomogeneous Self-Exciting Process
maintainer: Feng Chen
description: Simulate an inhomogeneous self-exciting process (IHSEP), or Hawkes process,
  with a given (possibly time-varying) baseline intensity and an excitation function.
  Calculate the likelihood of an IHSEP with given baseline intensity and excitation
  functions for an (increasing) sequence of event times. Calculate the point process
  residuals (integral transforms of the original event times). Calculate the mean
  intensity process.
