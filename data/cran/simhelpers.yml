maintainer: Megha Joshi
description: 'Calculates performance criteria measures and associated Monte Carlo
  standard errors for simulation results. Includes functions to help run simulation
  studies. Our derivation and explanation of formulas and our general simulation workflow
  is closely aligned with the approach described by Morris, White, and Crowther (2019)
