title: Access Google Sheets using the Sheets API V4
maintainer: Jennifer Bryan
description: |-
  Interact with Google Sheets through the Sheets API
  v4 <https://developers.google.com/sheets/api>. "API" is an acronym for
  "application programming interface"; the Sheets API allows users to
  interact with Google Sheets programmatically, instead of via a web
  browser. The "v4" refers to the fact that the Sheets API is currently
  at version 4. This package can read and write both the metadata and
  the cell data in a Sheet.
