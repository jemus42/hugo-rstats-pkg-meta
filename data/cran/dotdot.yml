title: Enhanced Assignment Operator to Overwrite or Grow Objects
maintainer: Antoine Fabri
description: |2-

  Use '..' on the right hand side of the ':=' operator as a shorthand for the
  left hand side, so that 'var := f(..) + ..' is equivalent to
  'var <- f(var) + var'. This permits the user to be explicit about growing an
  object or overwriting it using its previous value, avoids repeating a
  variable name, and saves keystrokes, time, visual space and cognitive load.
