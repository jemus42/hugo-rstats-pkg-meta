title: Methods for Multivariate Quadrature
maintainer: Constantin Weiser
description: |-
  Provides methods to construct multivariate grids, which can be used
  for multivariate quadrature. This grids can be based on different quadrature
  rules like Newton-Cotes formulas (trapezoidal-, Simpson's- rule, ...) or Gauss
  quadrature (Gauss-Hermite, Gauss-Legendre, ...). For the construction of the
  multidimensional grid the product-rule or the combination- technique can be
  applied.
