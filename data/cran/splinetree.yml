title: Longitudinal Regression Trees and Forests
maintainer: Anna Neufeld
description: Builds regression trees and random forests for longitudinal or functional
  data using a spline projection method. Implements and extends the work of Yu and
  Lambert (1999) <doi:10.1080/10618600.1999.10474847>. This method allows trees and
  forests to be built while considering either level and shape or only shape of response
  trajectories.
