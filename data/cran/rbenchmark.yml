title: Benchmarking routine for R
maintainer: Wacek Kusnierczyk
description: rbenchmark is inspired by the Perl module Benchmark, and<U+000a>is intended
  to facilitate benchmarking of arbitrary R code. The<U+000a>library consists of just
  one function, benchmark, which is a<U+000a>simple wrapper around system.time.  Given
  a specification of<U+000a>the benchmarking process (counts of replications, evaluation<U+000a>environment)
  and an arbitrary number of expressions, benchmark<U+000a>evaluates each of the expressions
  in the specified environment,<U+000a>replicating the evaluation as many times as
  specified, and<U+000a>returning the results conveniently wrapped into a data frame.
