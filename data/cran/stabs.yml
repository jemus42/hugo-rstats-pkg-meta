title: Stability Selection with Error Control
maintainer: Benjamin Hofner
description: |-
  Resampling procedures to assess the stability of selected variables
  with additional finite sample error control for high-dimensional variable
  selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. Both, standard stability
  selection (Meinshausen & Buhlmann, 2010, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x>)
  and complementary pairs stability selection with improved error bounds
  (Shah & Samworth, 2013, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01034.x>) are
  implemented. The package can be combined with arbitrary user specified
  variable selection approaches.
