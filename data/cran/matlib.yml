  Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and
  Multivariate Statistics
maintainer: Michael Friendly
description: |-
  A collection of matrix functions for teaching and learning matrix
  linear algebra as used in multivariate statistical methods. These functions are
  mainly for tutorial purposes in learning matrix algebra ideas using R. In some
  cases, functions are provided for concepts available elsewhere in R, but where
  the function call or name is not obvious. In other cases, functions are provided
  to show or demonstrate an algorithm. In addition, a collection of functions are
  provided for drawing vector diagrams in 2D and 3D.
