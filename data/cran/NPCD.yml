title: Nonparametric Methods for Cognitive Diagnosis
maintainer: Yi Zheng
description: An array of nonparametric and parametric estimation methods for cognitive
  diagnostic models, including nonparametric classification of examinee attribute
  profiles, joint maximum likelihood estimation (JMLE) of examinee attribute profiles
  and item parameters, and nonparametric refinement of the Q-matrix, as well as conditional
  maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) of examinee attribute profiles given item parameters
  and CMLE of item parameters given examinee attribute profiles. Currently the nonparametric
  methods in the package support both conjunctive and disjunctive models, and the
  parametric methods in the package support the DINA model, the DINO model, the NIDA
  model, the G-NIDA model, and the R-RUM model.
