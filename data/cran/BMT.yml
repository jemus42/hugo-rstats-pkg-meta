title: The BMT Distribution
maintainer: Camilo Jose Torres-Jimenez
description: Density, distribution, quantile function, random number generation for
  the BMT (Bezier-Montenegro-Torres) distribution. Torres-Jimenez C.J. and Montenegro-Diaz
  A.M. (2017) <arXiv:1709.05534>. Moments, descriptive measures and parameter conversion
  for different parameterizations of the BMT distribution. Fit of the BMT distribution
  to non-censored data by maximum likelihood, moment matching, quantile matching,
  maximum goodness-of-fit, also known as minimum distance, maximum product of spacing,
  also called maximum spacing, and minimum quantile distance, which can also be called
  maximum quantile goodness-of-fit. Fit of univariate distributions for non-censored
  data using maximum product of spacing estimation and minimum quantile distance estimation
  is also included.
