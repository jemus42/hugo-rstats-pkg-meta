title: Shape Selection for Landsat Time Series of Forest Dynamics
maintainer: Xiyue Liao
description: Landsat satellites collect important data about global forest conditions.
  Documentation about Landsat's role in forest disturbance estimation is available
  at the site <http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=9513>. By constrained quadratic B-splines,
  this package delivers an optimal shape-restricted trajectory to a time series of
  Landsat imagery for the purpose of modeling annual forest disturbance dynamics to
  behave in an ecologically sensible manner assuming one of seven possible "shapes",
  namely, flat, decreasing, one-jump (decreasing, jump up, decreasing), inverted vee
  (increasing then decreasing), vee (decreasing then increasing), linear increasing,
  and double-jump (decreasing, jump up, decreasing, jump up, decreasing). The main
  routine selects the best shape according to the minimum Bayes information criterion
  (BIC) or the cone information criterion (CIC), which is defined as the log of the
  estimated predictive squared error. The package also provides parameters summarizing
  the temporal pattern including year(s) of inflection, magnitude of change, pre-
  and post-inflection rates of growth or recovery. In addition, it contains routines
  for converting a flat map of disturbance agents to time-series disturbance maps
  and a graphical routine displaying the fitted trajectory of Landsat imagery.
