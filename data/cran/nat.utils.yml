title: File System Utility Functions for 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox'
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  Utility functions that may be of general interest but are
  specifically required by the 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox' ('nat'). Includes
  functions to provide a basic make style system to update files based on
  timestamp information, file locking and 'touch' utility. Convenience
  functions for working with file paths include 'abs2rel', 'split_path'
  and 'common_path'. Finally there are utility functions for working with
  'zip' and 'gzip' files including integrity tests.
