  A Bayesian Semiparametric Factor Analysis Model for Subtype
  Identification (Clustering)

description: |-
  Gene expression profiles are commonly utilized to infer disease
  subtypes and many clustering methods can be adopted for this task.
  However, existing clustering methods may not perform well when
  genes are highly correlated and many uninformative genes are included
  for clustering. To deal with these challenges, we develop a novel
  clustering method in the Bayesian setting. This method, called BCSub,
  adopts an innovative semiparametric Bayesian factor analysis model
  to reduce the dimension of the data to a few factor scores for
  clustering. Specifically, the factor scores are assumed to follow
  the Dirichlet process mixture model in order to induce clustering.
