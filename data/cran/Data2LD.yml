maintainer: James Ramsay
description: |-
  Provides methods for using differential equations as modelling
  objects as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker (2017,ISBN 978-1-4939-7188-6)
  Dynamic Data Analysis, New York: Springer. Data sets and script files for
  analyzing many of the examples in this book are included. This version
  corrects bugs and adds a new demo, CruiseControl. 'Matlab' versions of the
  code and sample analyses are available by ftp from
  <http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/Data2LD/>.  There you find
  a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well
  as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional
