description: 'Perform sign test on one-sample data, which is one of the oldest non-parametric
  statistical methods. Assume that X comes from a continuous distribution with median
  = v ( unknown ). Test the null hypothesis H0: median of X v = mu ( mu is the location
  parameter and is given in the test ) v.s. the alternative hypothesis H1: v > mu
  ( or v < mu or v != mu ) and calculate the p-value. When the sample size is large,
  perform the asymptotic sign test. In both ways, calculate the R-estimate of location
  of X and the distribution free confidence interval for mu.'
