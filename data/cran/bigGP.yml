title: Distributed Gaussian Process Calculations
maintainer: Christopher Paciorek
description: |-
  Distributes Gaussian process calculations across nodes
  in a distributed memory setting, using Rmpi. The bigGP class
  provides high-level methods for maximum likelihood with normal data,
  prediction, calculation of uncertainty (i.e., posterior covariance
  calculations), and simulation of realizations. In addition, bigGP
  provides an API for basic matrix calculations with distributed
  covariance matrices, including Cholesky decomposition, back/forwardsolve,
  crossproduct, and matrix multiplication.
