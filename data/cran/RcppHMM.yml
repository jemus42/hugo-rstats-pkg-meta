title: Rcpp Hidden Markov Model
maintainer: Roberto A. Cardenas-Ovando
description: Collection of functions to evaluate sequences, decode hidden states and
  estimate parameters from a single or multiple sequences of a discrete time Hidden
  Markov Model. The observed values can be modeled by a multinomial distribution for
  categorical/labeled emissions, a mixture of Gaussians for continuous data and also
  a mixture of Poissons for discrete values. It includes functions for random initialization,
  simulation, backward or forward sequence evaluation, Viterbi or forward-backward
  decoding and parameter estimation using an Expectation-Maximization approach.
