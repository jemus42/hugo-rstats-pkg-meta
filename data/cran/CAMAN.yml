description: |-
  Tools for the analysis of finite semiparametric mixtures.
  These are useful when data is heterogeneous, e.g. in
  pharmacokinetics or meta-analysis. The NPMLE and VEM algorithms
  (flexible support size) and EM algorithms (fixed support size)
  are provided for univariate and bivariate data.
