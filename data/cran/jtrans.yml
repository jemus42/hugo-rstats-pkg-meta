title: Johnson Transformation for Normality
maintainer: Yuchen Wang
description: |-
  Transforming univariate non-normal data to normality using Johnson
  families of distributions. Johnson family is a comprehensive distribution
  family that accommodates many kinds of non-normal distributions. A bunch of
  distributions with various parameters will be fit and the corresponding
  p-values under a user-specified normality test will be given. The final
  transformation will be the one with the largest p-value under the given
  normality test.
