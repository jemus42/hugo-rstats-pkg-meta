description: Functions for estimating times of common ancestry and molecular clock
  rates of evolution using a variety of evolutionary models, parametric and nonparametric
  bootstrap confidence intervals, methods for detecting outlier lineages, root-to-tip
  regression, and a statistical test for selecting molecular clock models. The methods
  are described in Volz, E.M. and S.D.W. Frost (2017) <doi:10.1093/ve/vex025>.
