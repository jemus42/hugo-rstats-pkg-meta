title: Simulation of the Growth of Framboidal and Sunflower Pyrite
maintainer: Raul Merinero
description: |-
  Generation of theoretical size distributions of framboidal or sunflower pyrite.
  The growth mechanisms used are surface and supply controlled and dependent
  or independent of size. The algorithms are fully described in the published work
  in Mineralogy and Petrology journal:
  "Theoretical growth of framboidal and sunflower pyrite using the R-package frambgrowth"
  The authors Merinero, R., and Cardenes, V. (2018).
