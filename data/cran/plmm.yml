title: Partially Linear Mixed Effects Model
maintainer: OHINATA Ren
description: |-
  This package fits the partially linear mixed effects model
  (semiparametric random intercept model) using kernel
  regression, without distributional assumptions for the random
  terms. Estimation procedure is an iterative generalized least
  squares type. A nonparametric heteroskedastic variance function
  is allowed for the regression error. Bootstrap resampling is
  provided for inference. The package implements bandwidth
  selection by an alternative cross validation for correlated
  data.
