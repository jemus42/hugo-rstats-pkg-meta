  Models
maintainer: Andrew T. Jones
description: Computes clustering by fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMM) via stochastic
  approximation following the methods of Nguyen and Jones (2018) <doi:10.1201/9780429446177>.
  It also provides some test data generation and plotting functionality to assist
  with this process.
