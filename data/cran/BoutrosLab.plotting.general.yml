title: Functions to Create Publication-Quality Plots
maintainer: Paul Boutros
description: Contains several plotting functions such as barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps,
  as well as functions to combine plots and assist in the creation of these plots.
  These functions will give users great ease of use and customization options in broad
  use for biomedical applications, as well as general purpose plotting. Each of the
  functions also provides valid default settings to make plotting data more efficient
  and producing high quality plots with standard colour schemes simpler. All functions
  within this package are capable of producing plots that are of the quality to be
  presented in scientific publications and journals.
