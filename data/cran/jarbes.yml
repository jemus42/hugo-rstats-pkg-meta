title: Just a Rather Bayesian Evidence Synthesis
maintainer: Pablo Emilio Verde
description: Provides a new class of Bayesian meta-analysis models that we called
  "The Hierarchical Meta-Regression" (HMR). The aim of HMR is to incorporate into
  the meta-analysis, the data collection process, which results in a model for the
  internal and external validity bias. In this way, it is possible to combine studies
  of different types. For example, we can combine the results of randomized control
  trials (RCTs) with the results of observational studies (OS). The statistical methods
  and their applications are described in Verde (2019) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700266>
  and in Verde (2017) <doi:10.5772/intechopen.70231>.
