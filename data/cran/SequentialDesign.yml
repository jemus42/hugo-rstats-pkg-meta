  Observational Database Study Planning using Exact Sequential
  Analysis for Poisson and Binomial Data
maintainer: Judith Maro
description: Functions to be used in conjunction with the 'Sequential' package that
  allows for planning of observational database studies that will be analyzed with
  exact sequential analysis. This package supports Poisson- and binomial-based data.
  The primary function, seq_wrapper(...), accepts parameters for simulation of a simple
  exposure pattern and for the 'Sequential' package setup and analysis functions.
  The exposure matrix is used to simulate the true and false positive and negative
  populations (Green (1983) <doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113521>, Brenner (1993)
  <doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116805>). Functions are then run from the 'Sequential'
  package on these populations, which allows for the exploration of outcome misclassification
  in data.
