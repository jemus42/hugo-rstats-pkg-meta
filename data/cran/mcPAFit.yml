  Estimating Preferential Attachment from a Single Network
  Snapshot by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
maintainer: Thong Pham
description: A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is provided to estimate the preferential
  attachment function from a single network snapshot. Conventional methods require
  the complete information about the appearance order of all nodes and edges in the
  network. This package incorporates the appearance order into the state space and
  estimates it together with the preferential attachment function.
