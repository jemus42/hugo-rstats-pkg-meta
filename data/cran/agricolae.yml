maintainer: Felipe de Mendiburu
description: Original idea was presented in the thesis "A statistical analysis tool
  for agricultural research" to obtain the degree of Master on science, National Engineering
  University (UNI), Lima-Peru. Some experimental data for the examples come from the
  CIP and others research. Agricolae offers extensive functionality on experimental
  design especially for agricultural and plant breeding experiments, which can also
  be useful for other purposes. It supports planning of lattice, Alpha, Cyclic, Complete
  Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin Squares, augmented block, factorial, split and
  strip plot designs. There are also various analysis facilities for experimental
  data, e.g. treatment comparison procedures and several non-parametric tests comparison,
  biodiversity indexes and consensus cluster.
