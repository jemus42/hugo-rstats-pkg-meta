version: 0.14.1
title: Friendly R Startup Configuration
maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson
description: Adds support for R startup configuration via '.Renviron.d' and '.Rprofile.d'
  directories in addition to '.Renviron' and '.Rprofile' files.  This makes it possible
  to keep private / secret environment variables separate from other environment variables.  It
  also makes it easier to share specific startup settings by simply copying a file
  to a directory.
