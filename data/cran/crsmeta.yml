title: Extract Coordinate System Metadata
maintainer: Michael Sumner
description: |-
  Obtain coordinate system metadata from various data formats. There
  are functions to extract a 'CRS' (coordinate reference system,
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>) in 'EPSG' (European
  Petroleum Survey Group, <http://www.epsg.org/>), 'PROJ4' <https://proj.org/>,
  or 'WKT2' (Well-Known Text 2,
  <http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html>) forms. This is
  purely for getting simple metadata from in-memory formats, please use other
  tools for out of memory data sources.
