  Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm>
  is a computational method that is used to solve optimization
  problems of different types and it is the mathematical model
  and the computer simulation of human social evolution.
  The package provides a minimum value for the cost function
  and the best value for the optimization variables by
  Imperialist Competitive Algorithm.
  Users can easily define their own objective function
  depending on the problem at hand.
  This version has been successfully applied to solve
  optimization problems, for continuous functions.
