title: Variable-Group Methods for Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
maintainer: Alberto Fernandez
description: |-
  A collection of methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering
  strategies on a matrix of distances, implemented using the variable-group
  approach introduced in Fernandez and Gomez (2008)
  <doi:10.1007/s00357-008-9004-x>. Descriptive measures to analyze the resulting
  hierarchical trees are also provided. In addition to the usual clustering
  methods, two parameterized methods are provided to explore an infinite family
  of hierarchical clustering strategies. When there are ties in proximity
  values, the hierarchical trees obtained are unique and independent of the
  order of the elements in the input matrix.
