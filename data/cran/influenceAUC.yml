  provide two theoretical methods (influence function and local influence) based on
  the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to quantify the
  numerical impact of each observation to the overall AUC. Alternative graphical tools,
  cumulative lift charts, are proposed to reveal the existences and approximate locations
  of those influential observations through data visualization.
