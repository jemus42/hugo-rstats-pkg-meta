title: Bureau of Economic Analysis API
maintainer: Andrea Batch
description: |-
  Provides an R interface for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
  API (see <http://www.bea.gov/API/bea_web_service_api_user_guide.htm> for
  more information) that serves two core purposes -
  1. To Extract/Transform/Load data [beaGet()] from the BEA API as R-friendly
  formats in the user's work space [transformation done by default in beaGet()
  can be modified using optional parameters; see, too, bea2List(), bea2Tab()].
  2. To enable the search of descriptive meta data [beaSearch()].
  Other features of the library exist mainly as intermediate methods
  or are in early stages of development.
  Important Note - You must have an API key to use this library.
