title: Calculation of the OPTICS Cordillera
maintainer: Thomas Rusch
description: Functions for calculating the OPTICS Cordillera. The OPTICS Cordillera
  measures the amount of 'clusteredness' in a numeric data matrix within a distance-density
  based framework for a given minimum number of points comprising a cluster, as described
  in Rusch, Hornik, Mair (2017) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664>. There is an R
  native version and a version that uses 'ELKI', with methods for printing, summarizing,
  and plotting the result. There also is an interface to the reference implementation
  of OPTICS in 'ELKI'.
