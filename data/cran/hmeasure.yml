  The H-Measure and Other Scalar Classification Performance
  Metrics
maintainer: Christoforos Anagnostopoulos
description: |-
  Classification performance metrics that are derived from the ROC
  curve of a classifier. The package includes the H-measure performance metric
  as described in <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5>,
  which computes the minimum total misclassification cost, integrating over any
  uncertainty about the relative misclassification costs, as per a user-defined
  prior. It also offers a one-stop-shop for other scalar metrics of performance,
  including sensitivity, specificity and many others, and also offers plotting
  tools for ROC curves and related statistics.
