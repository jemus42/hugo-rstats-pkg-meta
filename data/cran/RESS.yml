title: Integrates R and Essentia
maintainer: Ben Waxer
description: Contains three functions that query AuriQ Systems' Essentia Database
  and return the results in R. 'essQuery' takes a single Essentia command and captures
  the output in R, where you can save the output to a dataframe or stream it directly
  into additional analysis. 'read.essentia' takes an Essentia script and captures
  the output csv data into R, where you can save the output to a dataframe or stream
  it directly into additional analysis. 'capture.essentia' takes a file containing
  any number of Essentia commands and captures the output of the specified statements
  into R dataframes. Essentia can be downloaded for free at http://www.auriq.com/documentation/source/install/index.html.
