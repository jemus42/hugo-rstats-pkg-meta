title: Computing Optimal Cutpoints in Diagnostic Tests
maintainer: Monica Lopez Raton
description: Computes optimal cutpoints for diagnostic tests or continuous markers.
  Various approaches for selecting optimal cutoffs have been implemented, including
  methods based on cost-benefit analysis and diagnostic test accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity,
  Predictive Values and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical and graphical output
  for all methods is easily obtained.
