  Constructing Gene Co-Expression Networks for Single-Cell
  RNA-Sequencing Data Using Pseudotime Ordering
maintainer: Alicia T. Specht
description: Advances in sequencing technology now allow researchers to capture the
  expression profiles of individual cells. Several algorithms have been developed
  to attempt to account for these effects by determining a cell's so-called `pseudotime',
  or relative biological state of transition. By applying these algorithms to single-cell
  sequencing data, we can sort cells into their pseudotemporal ordering based on gene
  expression. LEAP (Lag-based Expression Association for Pseudotime-series) then applies
  a time-series inspired lag-based correlation analysis to reveal linearly dependent
  genetic associations.
