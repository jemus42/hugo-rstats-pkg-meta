maintainer: Manuel Wiesenfarth
description: Tools and workflow to choose design parameters in Bayesian adaptive single-arm
  phase II trial designs with binary endpoint (response, success) with possible stopping
  for efficacy and futility at interim analyses. Also contains routines to determine
  and visualize operating characteristics. See Kopp-Schneider et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700209>.
