maintainer: Haeran Cho
description: Implementations of MOSUM-based statistical procedures and algorithms
  for detecting multiple changes in the mean. This comprises the MOSUM procedure for
  estimating multiple mean changes from Eichinger and Kirch (2018) <doi:10.3150/16-BEJ887>
  and the multiscale algorithmic extensions from Cho and Kirch (2019) <arXiv:1910.12486>.
