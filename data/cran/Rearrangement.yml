  Monotonize Point and Interval Functional Estimates by
  Rearrangement
maintainer: Ivan Fernandez-Val
description: |-
  The rearrangement operator (Hardy,
  Littlewood, and Polya 1952) for univariate, bivariate, and
  trivariate point estimates of monotonic functions. The package
  additionally provides a function that creates simultaneous
  confidence intervals for univariate functions and applies the
  rearrangement operator to these confidence intervals.
