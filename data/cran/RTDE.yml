title: Robust Tail Dependence Estimation
maintainer: Christophe Dutang
description: Robust tail dependence estimation for bivariate models. This package
  is based on two papers by the authors:'Robust and bias-corrected estimation of the
  coefficient of tail dependence' and 'Robust and bias-corrected estimation of probabilities
  of extreme failure sets'. This work was supported by a research grant (VKR023480)
  from VILLUM FONDEN and an international project for scientific cooperation (PICS-6416).
