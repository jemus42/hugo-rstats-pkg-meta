title: Simple Interactive Controls for R using the 'tcltk' Package
maintainer: Adrian Bowman
description: |-
  A set of functions to build simple
  GUI controls for R functions.  These are built on the 'tcltk' package.
  Uses could include changing a parameter on a graph by animating it
  with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more sophisticated control
  panels.
  Some functions for specific graphical tasks, referred to as 'cartoons',
  are provided.
