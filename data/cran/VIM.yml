title: Visualization and Imputation of Missing Values
maintainer: Matthias Templ
description: |-
  New tools for the visualization of missing and/or imputed values
  are introduced, which can be used for exploring the data and the structure of
  the missing and/or imputed values. Depending on this structure of the missing
  values, the corresponding methods may help to identify the mechanism generating
  the missing values and allows to explore the data including missing values.
  In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually explored using various
  univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate plot methods. A graphical user
  interface available in the separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of
  the implemented plot methods.
