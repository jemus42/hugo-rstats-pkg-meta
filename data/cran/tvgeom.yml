title: The Time-Varying (Right-Truncated) Geometric Distribution
maintainer: Vincent Landau
description: |-
  Probability mass (d), distribution (p), quantile (q), and random
  number generating (r and rt) functions for the time-varying right-truncated
  geometric (tvgeom) distribution. Also provided are functions to calculate the first
  and second central moments of the distribution. The tvgeom distribution
  is similar to the geometric distribution, but the probability
  of success is allowed to vary at each time step, and there are a limited
  number of trials. This distribution is essentially a Markov chain, and it
  is useful for modeling Markov chain systems with a set
  number of time steps.
