title: Graphical Analysis of Structural Causal Models
maintainer: Johannes Textor
description: |-
  A port of the web-based software 'DAGitty', available at
  <http://dagitty.net>, for analyzing structural causal models
  (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs).
  This package computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal
  effects, enumerates instrumental variables, derives testable
  implications (d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent
  models, and includes a simple facility for data simulation.
