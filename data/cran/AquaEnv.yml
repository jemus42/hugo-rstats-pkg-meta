  Integrated Development Toolbox for Aquatic Chemical Model
  Generation
maintainer: Karline Soetaert
description: |-
  Toolbox for the experimental aquatic chemist, focused on
  acidification and CO2 air-water exchange. It contains all elements to
  model the pH, the related CO2 air-water exchange, and
  aquatic acid-base chemistry for an arbitrary marine,
  estuarine or freshwater system. It contains a suite of tools for
  sensitivity analysis, visualisation, modelling of chemical batches,
  and can be used to build dynamic models of aquatic systems.
  As from version 1.0-4, it also contains functions to calculate
  the buffer factors.
