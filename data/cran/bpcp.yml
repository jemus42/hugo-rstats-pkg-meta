title: Beta Product Confidence Procedure for Right Censored Data
maintainer: Michael P. Fay
description: Calculates nonparametric pointwise confidence intervals for the survival
  distribution for right censored data, and for medians [Fay and Brittain <doi:10.1002/sim.6905>].
  Has two-sample tests for dissimilarity (e.g., difference, ratio or odds ratio) in
  survival at a fixed time, and differences in medians [Fay, Proschan, and Brittain
  <doi:10.1111/biom.12231>]. Especially important for latter parts of the survival
  curve, small sample sizes or heavily censored data. Includes mid-p options.
