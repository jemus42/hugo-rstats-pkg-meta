title: Generate RNA-Seq Data from Gene-Gene Association Networks
maintainer: Tyler Grimes
description: Methods to generate random gene-gene association networks and simulate
  RNA-seq data from them. Includes functions to generate random networks of any size
  and perturb them to obtain differential networks. Network objects are built from
  individual, overlapping modules that represent pathways. The resulting network has
  various topological properties that are characteristic of gene regulatory networks.
  RNA-seq data can be generated such that the association among gene expression profiles
  reflect the underlying network. A reference RNA-seq dataset can be provided to model
  realistic marginal distributions. Plotting functions are available to visualize
  a network, compare two networks, and compare the expression of two genes across
  multiple networks.
