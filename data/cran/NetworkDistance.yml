title: Distance Measures for Networks
maintainer: Kisung You
description: Network is a prevalent form of data structure in many fields. As an object
  of analysis, many distance or metric measures have been proposed to define the concept
  of similarity between two networks. We provide a number of distance measures for
  networks. See Jurman et al (2011) <doi:10.3233/978-1-60750-692-8-227> for an overview
  on spectral class of inter-graph distance measures.
