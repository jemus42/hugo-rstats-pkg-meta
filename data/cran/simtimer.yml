title: Datetimes as Integers for Discrete-Event Simulations
maintainer: Adrian Staempfli
description: |-
  Handles datetimes as integers for the usage inside
  Discrete-Event Simulations (DES). The conversion is made using
  the internally generic function as.numeric() of the base
  package. DES is described in Simulation Modeling and Analysis
  by Averill Law and David Kelton (1999) <doi:10.2307/2288169>.
