title: Quadratic Inference Function
maintainer: Michael Kleinsasser
description: |-
  Developed to perform the estimation and inference for regression
  coefficient parameters in longitudinal marginal models using the method of
  quadratic inference functions. Like generalized estimating equations, this
  method is also a quasi-likelihood inference method. It has been showed that
  the method gives consistent estimators of the regression coefficients even if
  the correlation structure is misspecified, and it is more efficient than GEE
  when the correlation structure is misspecified. Based on Qu, A., Lindsay,
  B.G. and Li, B. (2000) <doi:10.1093/biomet/87.4.823>.
