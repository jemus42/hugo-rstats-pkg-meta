title: Quantifying Evolution and Selection on Complex Traits
maintainer: Medhat Mahmoud
description: |-
  Functions are provided for quantifying evolution and selection on complex traits.
  The package implements effective handling and analysis algorithms scaled for
  genome-wide data and calculates a composite statistic, denoted Ghat, which is used
  to test for selection on a trait. The package provides a number of simple examples
  for handling and analysing the genome data and visualising the output and results.
