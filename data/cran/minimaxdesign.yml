title: Minimax and Minimax Projection Designs
maintainer: Simon Mak
description: |-
  Provides two main functions, minimax() and miniMaxPro(), for computing minimax
  and minimax projection designs using the minimax clustering algorithm in Mak and
  Joseph (2018) <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302881>. Current design region options
  include the unit hypercube ("hypercube"), the unit simplex ("simplex"), the unit ball
  ("ball"), as well as user-defined constraints on the unit hypercube ("custom"). Minimax
  designs can also be computed on user-provided images using the function minimax.map().
  Design quality can be assessed using the function mMdist(), which computes the minimax
  (fill) distance of a design.
