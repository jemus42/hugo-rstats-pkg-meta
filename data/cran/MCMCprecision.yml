title: Precision of Discrete Parameters in Transdimensional MCMC
maintainer: Daniel W. Heck
description: |-
  Estimates the precision of transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo
  (MCMC) output, which is often used for Bayesian analysis of models with different
  dimensionality (e.g., model selection). Transdimensional MCMC (e.g., reversible
  jump MCMC) relies on sampling a discrete model-indicator variable to estimate
  the posterior model probabilities. If only few switches occur between the models,
  precision may be low and assessment based on the assumption of independent
  samples misleading. Based on the observed transition matrix of the indicator
  variable, the method of Heck, Overstall, Gronau, & Wagenmakers (2019,
  Statistics & Computing, 29, 631-643) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9828-0> draws
  posterior samples of the stationary distribution to (a) assess the uncertainty
  in the estimated posterior model probabilities and (b) estimate the effective
  sample size of the MCMC output.
