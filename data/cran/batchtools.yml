title: Tools for Computation on Batch Systems
maintainer: Michel Lang
description: |-
  As a successor of the packages 'BatchJobs' and 'BatchExperiments',
  this package provides a parallel implementation of the Map function for high
  performance computing systems managed by schedulers 'IBM Spectrum LSF'
  (<https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management>),
  'OpenLava' (<http://www.openlava.org/>), 'Univa Grid Engine'/'Oracle Grid
  Engine' (<http://www.univa.com/>), 'Slurm' (<http://slurm.schedmd.com/>),
  'TORQUE/PBS'
  (<https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/>),
  or 'Docker Swarm' (<https://docs.docker.com/swarm/>).
  A multicore and socket mode allow the parallelization on a local machines,
  and multiple machines can be hooked up via SSH to create a makeshift
  cluster. Moreover, the package provides an abstraction mechanism to define
  large-scale computer experiments in a well-organized and reproducible way.
