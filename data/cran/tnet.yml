title: Weighted, Two-Mode, and Longitudinal Networks Analysis
maintainer: Tore Opsahl
description: Binary ties limit the richness of network analyses as relations are unique.
  The two-mode structure contains a number of features lost when projection it to
  a one-mode network. Longitudinal datasets allow for an understanding of the causal
  relationship among ties, which is not the case in cross-sectional datasets as ties
  are dependent upon each other.
