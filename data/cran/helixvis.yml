title: Visualize Alpha-Helical Peptide Sequences
maintainer: Raoul Wadhwa
description: |-
  Create publication-quality, 2-dimensional visualizations of alpha-helical peptide
  sequences. Specifically, allows the user to programmatically generate
  helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams to provide a bird's eye, top-down view of
  alpha-helical oligopeptides. See Wadhwa RR, et al. (2018)
  <doi:10.21105/joss.01008> for more information.
