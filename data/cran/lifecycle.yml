title: Manage the Life Cycle of your Package Functions
maintainer: Lionel Henry
description: |-
  Manage the life cycle of your exported functions with
  shared conventions, documentation badges, and non-invasive
  deprecation warnings. The 'lifecycle' package defines four
  development stages (experimental, maturing, stable, and
  questioning) and three deprecation stages (soft-deprecated,
  deprecated, and defunct). It makes it easy to insert badges
  corresponding to these stages in your documentation. Usage of
  deprecated functions are signalled with increasing levels of
  non-invasive verbosity.
