  Model Based Clustering, Classification and Discriminant Analysis
  Using the Mixture of Generalized Hyperbolic Distributions
maintainer: Cristina Tortora
description: Carries out model-based clustering, classification and discriminant analysis
  using five different models. The models are all based on the  generalized hyperbolic
  distribution. The first model 'MGHD' (Browne and McNicholas (2015) <doi:10.1002/cjs.11246>)
  is the classical mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions. The 'MGHFA' (Tortora
  et al. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s11634-015-0204-z>) is the mixture of generalized hyperbolic
  factor analyzers for high dimensional data sets. The 'MSGHD'(Tortora et al. (2016)
  <arXiv:1403.2332v7>), mixture of  multiple scaled generalized hyperbolic distributions.
  The 'cMSGHD' (Tortora et al. (2016) <arXiv:1403.2332v7>) is a 'MSGHD' with convex
  contour plots. The 'MCGHD' (Tortora et al. (2016) <arXiv:1403.2332v7>), mixture
  of  coalesced generalized hyperbolic distributions is a new more flexible model.
