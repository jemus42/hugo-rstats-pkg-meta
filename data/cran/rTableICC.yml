title: Random Generation of Contingency Tables
maintainer: Haydar Demirhan
description: Contains functions for random generation of R x C and 2 x 2 x K contingency
  tables. In addition to the generation of contingency tables over predetermined intraclass-correlated
  clusters, it is possible to generate contingency tables without intraclass correlations
  under product multinomial, multinomial, and Poisson sampling plans. It also consists
  of a function for generation of random data from a given discrete probability distribution
  function. See Demirhan (2016) <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016-1/demirhan.pdf>
  for more information.
