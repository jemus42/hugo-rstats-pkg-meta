  Differential Exon Usage Test for RNA-Seq Data via Empirical
  Bayes Shrinkage of the Dispersion Parameter
maintainer: Sean Ruddy
description: Differential exon usage test for RNA-Seq data via an empirical Bayes
  shrinkage method for the dispersion parameter the utilizes inclusion-exclusion data
  to analyze the propensity to skip an exon across groups. The input data consists
  of two matrices where each row represents an exon and the columns represent the
  biological samples. The first matrix is the count of the number of reads expressing
  the exon for each sample. The second matrix is the count of the number of reads
  that either express the exon or explicitly skip the exon across the samples, a.k.a.
  the total count matrix. Dividing the two matrices yields proportions representing
  the propensity to express the exon versus skipping the exon for each sample.
