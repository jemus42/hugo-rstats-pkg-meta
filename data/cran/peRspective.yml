description: |-
  Interface to the 'Perspective' API, which can be found at the following URL: <https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi#perspective-comment-analyzer-api>.
  The 'Perspective' API uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation (i.e. TOXICITY, INFLAMMATORY, etc.).
  'peRspective' provides access to the API and returns tidy data frames with results of the specified machine learning model(s).
