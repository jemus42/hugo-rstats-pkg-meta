  Sparse Autoencoder for Automatic Learning of Representative
  Features from Unlabeled Data
maintainer: Yuriy Tyshetskiy
description: Implementation of the sparse autoencoder in R environment, following
  the notes of Andrew Ng (http://www.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs294a/cs294a.1104/sparseAutoencoder.pdf).
  The features learned by the hidden layer of the autoencoder (through unsupervised
  learning of unlabeled data) can be used in constructing deep belief neural networks.
