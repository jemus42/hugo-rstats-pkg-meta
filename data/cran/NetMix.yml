title: Dynamic Mixed-Membership Network Regression Model
maintainer: Santiago Olivella
description: |-
  Variational EM estimation of mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel for networks,
  incorporating node-level predictors of mixed-membership vectors, as well as
  dyad-level predictors. For networks observed over time, the model defines a hidden
  Markov process that allows the effects of node-level predictors to evolve in discrete,
  historical periods. In addition, the package offers a variety of utilities for
  exploring results of estimation, including tools for conducting posterior
  predictive checks of goodness-of-fit and several plotting functions. The package
  implements methods described in Olivella, Pratt and Imai (2019) ``Dynamic Stochastic
  Blockmodel Regression for Social Networks: Application to International Conflicts'',
