maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Bindings to kernel methods for enforcing security restrictions.
  AppArmor can apply mandatory access control (MAC) policies on a given task
  (process) via security profiles with detailed ACL definitions. In addition
  this package implements bindings for setting process resource limits (rlimit),
  uid, gid, affinity and priority. The high level R function 'eval.secure'
  builds on these methods to perform dynamic sandboxing: it evaluates a single
  R expression within a temporary fork which acts as a sandbox by enforcing
  fine grained restrictions without affecting the main R process. A portable
  version of this function is now available in the 'unix' package.
