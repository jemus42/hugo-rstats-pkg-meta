title: Analyze Dose-Volume Histograms and Check Constraints
maintainer: Daniel Wollschlaeger
description: |-
  Functionality for analyzing dose-volume histograms (DVH)
  in radiation oncology: Read DVH text files, calculate DVH
  metrics as well as generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD),
  biologically effective dose (BED), equivalent dose in 2 Gy
  fractions (EQD2), normal tissue complication probability
  (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP). Show DVH
  diagrams, check and visualize quality assurance constraints
  for the DVH. Includes web-based graphical user interface.
