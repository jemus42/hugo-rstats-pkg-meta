title: Log-Rank Test Power Calculation
maintainer: Rong Lu
description: |-
  Power of the log-rank test is estimated using simulation datasets, with user specified total sample size (in one simulation dataset), type I error, effect size, the total number of simulation datasets, sample size ratio between two comparison groups, the death rate in the reference group, and the distribution of follow-up time (simulated from a negative binomial distribution). Method reference: Hogg, R. V., McKean, J., and Craig, A. T. (2004, ISBN 10: 0130085073).
