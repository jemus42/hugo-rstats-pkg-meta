maintainer: Laura Marshall
description: |-
  Animal abundance estimation via conventional, multiple covariate
  and mark-recapture distance sampling (CDS/MCDS/MRDS). Detection function
  fitting is performed via maximum likelihood. Also included are diagnostics
  and plotting for fitted detection functions. Abundance estimation is via a
  Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator.
