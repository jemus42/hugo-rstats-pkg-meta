title: Two Stage Residual Inclusion Additive Hazards Estimator
maintainer: Andrew Ying
description: Additive hazards models with two stage residual inclusion method are
  fitted under either survival data or competing risks data. The estimator incorporates
  an instrumental variable and therefore can recover causal estimand in the presence
  of unmeasured confounding under some assumptions. A.Ying, R. Xu and J. Murphy. (2019)
