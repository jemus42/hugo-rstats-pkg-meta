maintainer: Ashrith Reddy
description: Real life data is muddy, fuzzy and unpredictable. This makes data manipulations
  tedious and bringing the data to right shape alone is a major chunk of work. Functions
  in this package help us get an understanding of dataframes to dramatically reduces
  data coding time.
