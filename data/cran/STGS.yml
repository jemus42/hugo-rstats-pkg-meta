title: Genomic Selection using Single Trait
maintainer: Neeraj Budhlakoti
description: Genomic Selection (GS) is a latest development in animal and plant breeding
  where whole genome markers information is used to predict genetic merit of an individuals
  in a practical breeding programme. GS is one of the promising tool for improving
  genetic gain in animal and plants in todayâ€™s scenario. This package is basically
  developed for genomic predictions by estimating marker effects. These marker effects
  further used for calculation of genotypic merit of individual i.e. genome estimated
  breeding values (GEBVs). Genomic selection may be based on single trait or multi
  traits information. This package performs genomic selection only for single traits
  hence named as STGS i.e. single trait genomic selection. STGS is a comprehensive
  package which gives single step solution for genomic selection based on most commonly
  used statistical methods.
