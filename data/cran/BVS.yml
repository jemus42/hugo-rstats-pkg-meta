title: 'Bayesian Variant Selection: Bayesian Model Uncertainty<U+000a>Techniques for
  Genetic Association Studies'
maintainer: Melanie Quintana
description: The functions in this package focus on analyzing<U+000a>case-control
  association studies involving a group of genetic<U+000a>variants.  In particular,
  we are interested in modeling the<U+000a>outcome variable as a function of a multivariate
  genetic<U+000a>profile using Bayesian model uncertainty and variable selection<U+000a>techniques.  The
  package incorporates functions to analyze data<U+000a>sets involving common variants
  as well as extensions to model<U+000a>rare variants via the Bayesian Risk Index
  (BRI) as well as<U+000a>haplotypes.  Finally, the package also allows the incorporation<U+000a>of
  external biological information to inform the marginal<U+000a>inclusion probabilities
  via the iBMU.
