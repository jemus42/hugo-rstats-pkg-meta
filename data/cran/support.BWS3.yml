title: Tools for Case 3 Best-Worst Scaling
maintainer: Hideo Aizaki
description: Provides basic functions that support an implementation of multi-profile
  case (Case 3) best-worst scaling (BWS). Case 3 BWS is a question-based survey method
  to elicit people's preferences for attribute levels. Case 3 BWS constructs various
  combinations of attribute levels (profiles) and then asks respondents to select
  the best and worst profiles in each choice set. A main function creates a dataset
  for the analysis from the choice sets and the responses to the questions. For details
  on Case 3 BWS, refer to Louviere et al. (2015) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781107337855>.
