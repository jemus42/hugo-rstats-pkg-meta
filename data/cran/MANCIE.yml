description: High-dimensional data integration is a critical but difficult problem
  in genomics research because of potential biases from high-throughput experiments.
  We present MANCIE, a computational method for integrating two genomic data sets
  with homogenous dimensions from different sources based on a PCA procedure as an
  approximation to a Bayesian approach.
