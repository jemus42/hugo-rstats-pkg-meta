  Methods for Measuring Functional Diversity Based on Trait
  Probability Density
maintainer: Carlos P. Carmona
description: |-
  Tools to calculate trait probability density functions (TPD) at
  any scale (e.g. populations, species, communities). TPD functions are used to compute
  several indices of functional diversity, as well as its partition across scales.
  These indices constitute a unified framework that incorporates the underlying
  probabilistic nature of trait distributions into uni- or multidimensional
  functional trait-based studies. See Carmona et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.003> for
  further information.
