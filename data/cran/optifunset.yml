title: Set Options if Unset
maintainer: Nicholas Hamilton
description: A single function 'options.ifunset(...)' is contained herewith, which
  allows the user to set a global option ONLY if it is not already set. By this token,
  for package maintainers this function can be used in preference to the standard
  'options(...)' function, making provision for THEIR end user to place 'options(...)'
  directives within their '.Rprofile' file, which will not be overridden at the point
  when a package is loaded.
