title: Simulation of Pleiotropic, Linked and Epistatic Phenotypes
maintainer: Samuel Fernandes
description: The number of studies involving correlated traits and the availability
  of tools to handle this type of data has increased considerably in the last decade.
  With such a demand, we need tools for testing hypotheses related to single and multi-trait
  (correlated) phenotypes based on many genetic settings. Thus, we implemented various
  options for simulation of pleiotropy and Linkage Disequilibrium under additive,
  dominance and epistatic models. The simulation currently takes a marker data set
  as an input and then uses it for simulating multiple traits as described in Fernandes
  and Lipka (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.01.11.902874>.
