title: Hybrid Mortality Estimation
maintainer: Titus K Rotich
description: Hybrid Mortality Modelling (HMM) provides a framework in which mortality
  around "the accident hump" and at very old ages can be modelled under a single model.
  The graphics' codes necessary for visualization of the models' output are included
  here. Specifically, the graphics are based on the assumption that, the mortality
  rates can be expressed as a function of the area under the curve between the crude
  mortality rates plots and the tangential transform of the force of mortality.
