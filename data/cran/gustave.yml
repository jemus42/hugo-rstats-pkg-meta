  Estimation
maintainer: Martin Chevalier
description: Provides a toolkit for analytical variance estimation in survey sampling.
  Apart from the implementation of standard variance estimators, its main feature
  is to help the sampling expert produce easy-to-use variance estimation "wrappers",
  where systematic operations (linearization, domain estimation) are handled in a
  consistent and transparent way.
