title: Test Replications by Means of the Prior Predictive p-Value
maintainer: M.A.J. Zondervan-Zwijnenburg
description: Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to test replication
  of relevant features of original studies. Relevant features are captured in informative
  hypotheses. The package also allows for the computation of power. The statistical
  underpinnings are described in Zondervan-Zwijnenburg (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/uvh5s>.
