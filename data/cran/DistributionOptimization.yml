title: Distribution Optimization
maintainer: Florian Lerch
description: 'Fits Gaussian Mixtures by applying evolution. As fitness function a
  mixture of the chi square test for distributions and a novel measure for approximating
  the common area under curves between multiple Gaussians is used. The package presents
  an alternative to the commonly used Likelihood Maximization as is used in Expectation
  Maximization. The algorithm and applications of this package are published under:
  Lerch, F., Ultsch, A., Lotsch, J. (2020) <doi:10.1038/s41598-020-57432-w>. The evolution
  is based on the ''GA'' package: Scrucca, L. (2013) <doi:10.18637/jss.v053.i04> while
  the Gaussian Mixture Logic stems from ''AdaptGauss'': Ultsch, A, et al. (2015) <doi:10.3390/ijms161025897>.'
