title: Statistical Package for Reliability Data Analysis
maintainer: Yili Hong
description: The Statistical Package for REliability Data Analysis (SPREDA) implements
  recently-developed statistical methods for the analysis of reliability data. Modern
  technological developments, such as sensors and smart chips, allow us to dynamically
  track product/system usage as well as other environmental variables, such as temperature
  and humidity. We refer to these variables as dynamic covariates. The package contains
  functions for the analysis of time-to-event data with dynamic covariates and degradation
  data with dynamic covariates. The package also contains functions that can be used
  for analyzing time-to-event data with right censoring, and with left truncation
  and right censoring. Financial support from NSF and DuPont are acknowledged.
