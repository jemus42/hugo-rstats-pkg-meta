title: Diagnostic Tools for Hierarchical (Multilevel) Linear Models
maintainer: Adam Loy
description: |-
  A suite of diagnostic tools for hierarchical
  (multilevel) linear models. The tools include
  not only leverage and traditional deletion diagnostics (Cook's
  distance, covratio, covtrace, and MDFFITS) but also
  convenience functions and graphics for residual analysis. Models
  can be fit using either lmer in the 'lme4' package or lme in the 'nlme' package,
  but only two-level models fit using lme are currently supported.
