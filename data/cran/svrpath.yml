title: The SVR Path Algorithm
maintainer: Do Hyun Kim
description: Computes the entire solution paths for Support Vector Regression(SVR)
  with respect to the regularization parameter, lambda and epsilon in epsilon-intensive
  loss function, efficiently. We call each path algorithm svrpath and epspath. See
  Wang, G. et al (2008) <doi:10.1109/TNN.2008.2002077> for details regarding the method.
