description: Implements the estimation and inference methods for counterfactual analysis
  described in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and Melly (2013) <DOI:10.3982/ECTA10582>
  "Inference on Counterfactual Distributions," Econometrica, 81(6). The counterfactual
  distributions considered are the result of changing either the marginal distribution
  of covariates related to the outcome variable of interest, or the conditional distribution
  of the outcome given the covariates. They can be applied to estimate quantile treatment
  effects and wage decompositions.
