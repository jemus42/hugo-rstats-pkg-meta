title: Dithionite Scramblase Assay Analysis
maintainer: Johannes Graumann
description: |-
  The lipid scrambling activity of protein extracts and purified
  scramblases is often determined using a fluorescence-based assay involving
  many manual steps. flippant offers an integrated solution for the analysis
  and publication-grade graphical presentation of dithionite scramblase
  assays, as well as a platform for review, dissemination and extension of the
  strategies it employs. The package's name derives from a play on the fact
  that lipid scrambling is also sometimes referred to as 'flipping'.
