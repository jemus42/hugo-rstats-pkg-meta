title: Visualization of Functional Analysis Data
maintainer: Wencke Walter
description: |-
  Implementation of multilayered visualizations for enhanced
  graphical representation of functional analysis data. It combines and integrates
  omics data derived from expression and functional annotation enrichment
  analyses. Its plotting functions have been developed with an hierarchical
  structure in mind: starting from a general overview to identify the most
  enriched categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed one
  displaying different types of relevant information for the molecules in a given
  set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot, Venn diagram, heatmap).
