title: Robust Loss Development Using MCMC
maintainer: Can Wang
description: Bayesian analysis of loss development on insurance triangles or 'BALD'
  is a Bayesian model of developing aggregate loss triangles in property casualty
  insurance. This actuarial model makes use of a heteroskedastic and skewed t-likelihood
  with endogenous degrees of freedom, employs model averaging by means of Reversible
  Jump MCMC, and accommodates a structural break in the path of the consumption of
  benefits. Further, the model is capable of incorporating expert information in the
  calendar year effect. In an accompanying vignette, this model is applied to two
  widely studied General Liability and Auto Bodily Injury Liability loss triangles.
  For a description of the methodology, see Frank A. Schmid (2010) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.1501706>.
