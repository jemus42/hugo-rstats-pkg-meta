title: Extra Functionality for 'leaflet' Package
maintainer: Bhaskar Karambelkar
description: |-
  The 'leaflet' JavaScript library provides many plugins some of which
  are available in the core 'leaflet' package, but there are many more. It is not
  possible to support them all in the core 'leaflet' package. This package serves
  as an add-on to the 'leaflet' package by providing extra functionality via 'leaflet'
  plugins.
