title: Interface to 'Kusto'/'Azure Data Explorer'
maintainer: Alex Kyllo
description: 'An interface to ''Azure Data Explorer'', also known as ''Kusto'', a
  fast, highly scalable data exploration service from Microsoft: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/>.
  Includes ''DBI'' and ''dplyr'' interfaces, with the latter modelled after the ''dbplyr''
  package, whereby queries are translated from R into the native ''KQL'' query language
  and executed lazily. On the admin side, the package extends the object framework
  provided by ''AzureRMR'' to support creation and deletion of databases, and management
  of database principals. Part of the ''AzureR'' family of packages.'
