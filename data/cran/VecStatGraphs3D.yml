title: Vector analysis using graphical and analytical methods in 3D
maintainer: Pablo Garcia Rodriguez
description: 'This package performs a 3D statistical analysis, both numerical and
  graphical, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has three components (a module and
  two angles) vectorial analysis is performed in two stages: modules are analyzed
  by means of linear statistics and orientations are analyzed by spherical statistics.
  Tests and spherical statistic parameters are accompanied by a graphs as: density
  maps, distribution modules and angles. The tests, spherical statistic parameters
  and graphs allow us detecting another distribution properties (i.e. anisotropy)
  and outliers.'
