title: Assertions to Check Properties of Strings
maintainer: Richard Cotton
description: |-
  A set of predicates and assertions for checking the properties of
  UK-specific complex data types.  This is mainly for use by other package
  developers who want to include run-time testing features in their own
  packages.  End-users will usually want to use assertive directly.
