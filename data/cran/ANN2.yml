title: Artificial Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection
maintainer: Bart Lammers
description: |-
  Training of neural networks for classification and regression tasks
  using mini-batch gradient descent. Special features include a function for
  training autoencoders, which can be used to detect anomalies, and some
  related plotting functions. Multiple activation functions are supported,
  including tanh, relu, step and ramp. For the use of the step and ramp
  activation functions in detecting anomalies using autoencoders, see
  Hawkins et al. (2002) <doi:10.1007/3-540-46145-0_17>. Furthermore,
  several loss functions are supported, including robust ones such as Huber
  and pseudo-Huber loss, as well as L1 and L2 regularization. The possible
  options for optimization algorithms are RMSprop, Adam and SGD with momentum.
  The package contains a vectorized C++ implementation that facilitates
  fast training through mini-batch learning.
