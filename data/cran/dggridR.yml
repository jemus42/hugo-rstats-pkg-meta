title: Discrete Global Grids
maintainer: Richard Barnes
description: Spatial analyses involving binning require that every bin have the same
  area, but this is impossible using a rectangular grid laid over the Earth or over
  any projection of the Earth. Discrete global grids use hexagons, triangles, and
  diamonds to overcome this issue, overlaying the Earth with equally-sized bins. This
  package provides utilities for working with discrete global grids, along with utilities
  to aid in plotting such data.
