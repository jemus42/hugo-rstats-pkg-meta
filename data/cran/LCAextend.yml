  Latent Class Analysis (LCA) with Familial Dependence in Extended
  Pedigrees
maintainer: Alexandre BUREAU
description: |-
  Latent Class Analysis of
  phenotypic measurements in pedigrees and model selection
  based on one of two methods: likelihood-based cross-validation
  and Bayesian Information Criterion. Computation of individual
  and triplet child-parents weights in a pedigree is performed using an
  upward-downward algorithm. The model takes into account the familial
  dependence defined by the pedigree structure by considering
  that a class of a child depends on his parents classes via
  triplet-transition probabilities of the classes. The package
  handles the case where measurements are available on all
  subjects and the case where measurements are available only on
  symptomatic (i.e. affected) subjects. Distributions for
  discrete (or ordinal) and continuous data are currently
  implemented. The package can deal with missing data.
