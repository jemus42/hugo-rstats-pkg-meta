title: Multivariate Elastic Net Regression
maintainer: Armin Rauschenberger
description: Implements high-dimensional multivariate regression by stacked generalisation
  (Wolpert 1992 <doi:10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80023-1>). For positively correlated outcomes,
  a single multivariate regression is typically more predictive than multiple univariate
  regressions. Includes functions for model fitting, extracting coefficients, outcome
  prediction, and performance measurement.
