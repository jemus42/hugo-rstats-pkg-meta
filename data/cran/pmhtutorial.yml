title: Minimal Working Examples for Particle Metropolis-Hastings
maintainer: Johan Dahlin
description: |-
  Routines for state estimate in a linear
  Gaussian state space model and a simple stochastic volatility model using
  particle filtering. Parameter inference is also carried out in these models
  using the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that includes the particle
  filter to provided an unbiased estimator of the likelihood. This package is
  a collection of minimal working examples of these algorithms and is only
  meant for educational use and as a start for learning to them on your own.
