  Data sets and utilities from Project MOSAIC (<http://mosaic-web.org>) used
  to teach mathematics, statistics, computation and modeling.  Funded by the
  NSF, Project MOSAIC is a community of educators working to tie together
  aspects of quantitative work that students in science, technology,
  engineering and mathematics will need in their professional lives, but
  which are usually taught in isolation, if at all.
