title: Obtain, Organize, and Visualize NCEP Weather Data
maintainer: Michael U. Kemp
description: Contains functions to retrieve, organize, and visualize weather data
  from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (<http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html>)
  and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II (<http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html>)
  datasets.  Data are queried via the Internet and may be obtained for a specified
  spatial and temporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time.  We also
  provide functions to visualize these weather data on a map.  There are also functions
  to simulate flight trajectories according to specified behavior using either NCEP
  wind data or data specified by the user.
