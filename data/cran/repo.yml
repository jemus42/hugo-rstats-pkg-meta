title: A Data-Centered Data Flow Manager
maintainer: Francesco Napolitano
description: |-
  A data manager meant to avoid manual storage/retrieval of
  data to/from the file system. It builds one (or more) centralized
  repository where R objects are stored with rich annotations,
  including corresponding code chunks, and easily searched and
  retrieved. See Napolitano (2017) <doi:10.1037/a0028240> for further
  information.
