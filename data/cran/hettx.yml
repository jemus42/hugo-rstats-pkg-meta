  Fisherian and Neymanian Methods for Detecting and Measuring
  Treatment Effect Variation
maintainer: Ben Fifield
description: |-
  Implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12124> <arXiv:1412.5000>,
  and Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1407322> <arXiv:1605.06566>
  for testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects across observations, and for characterizing
  the extent of the explained and unexplained variation in treatment effects. The package includes wrapper functions
  implementing the proposed methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the results of the test.
