title: Measuring Multivariate Dependence Using Distance Multivariance
maintainer: Björn Böttcher
description: |-
  Distance multivariance is a measure of dependence which can be used to detect
  and quantify dependence of arbitrarily many random vectors. The necessary functions are
  implemented in this packages and examples are given. It includes: distance multivariance,
  distance multicorrelation, dependence structure detection, tests of independence and
  copula versions of distance multivariance based on the Monte Carlo empirical transform.
  Detailed references are given in the package description, as starting point for the
  theoretic background we refer to:
