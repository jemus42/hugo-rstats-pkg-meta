  Standard and Nonstandard Statistical Models and Methods for Test
  Equating
maintainer: Jorge Gonzalez
description: |-
  Contains functions to perform various models and
  methods for test equating. It currently implements the traditional
  mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods. Both IRT observed-score
  and true-score equating are also supported, as well as the mean-mean,
  mean-sigma, Haebara and Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods.
  It also supports newest methods such that local equating, kernel
  equating (using Gaussian, logistic, Epanechnikov, uniform and adaptive
  kernels) with presmoothing, and IRT parameter linking methods based on
  asymmetric item characteristic functions. Functions to obtain both
  standard error of equating (SEE) and standard error of equating differences
  between two equating functions (SEED) are also implemented for the kernel method of
  equating.
