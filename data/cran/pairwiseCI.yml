title: Confidence Intervals for Two Sample Comparisons
maintainer: Frank Schaarschmidt
description: |-
  Calculation of the parametric, nonparametric confidence intervals
  for the difference or ratio of location parameters, nonparametric confidence interval
  for the Behrens-Fisher problem and for the difference, ratio and odds-ratio of binomial
  proportions for comparison of independent samples. Common wrapper functions to split
  data sets and apply confidence intervals or tests to these subsets.
  A by-statement allows calculation of CI separately for the levels of further factors.
  CI are not adjusted for multiplicity.
