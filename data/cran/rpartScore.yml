title: Classification trees for ordinal responses
maintainer: Giuliano Galimberti
description: |-
  This package contains functions that allow to build
  classification trees for ordinal responses within the CART
  framework. The trees are grown using the Generalized Gini
  impurity function, where the misclassification costs are given
  by the absolute or squared differences in scores assigned to
  the categories of the response. Pruning is based on the total
  misclassification rate or on the total misclassification cost.
