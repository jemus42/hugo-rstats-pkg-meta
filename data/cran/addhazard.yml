title: Fit Additive Hazards Models for Survival Analysis
maintainer: Jie (Kate) Hu
description: |-
  Contains tools to fit the additive hazards model to data from a cohort,
  random sampling, two-phase Bernoulli sampling and two-phase finite population sampling,
  as well as calibration tool to incorporate phase I auxiliary information into the
  two-phase data model fitting.  This package provides regression parameter estimates and
  their model-based and robust standard errors. It also offers tools to make prediction of
  individual specific hazards.
