  Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  provide us with a wealth of data, such as RNA-seq, DNA Methylation,
  and Copy number variation data. It's easy to download data from TCGA using the
  gdc tool, but processing these data into a format suitable for bioinformatics
  analysis requires more work. This R package was developed to handle these data.
