  Sequential Optimal Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray
  Experiments
maintainer: Dibaba Bayisa Gemechu
description: Computes sequential A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block and
  row-column designs for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed
  effects and mixed effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all possible
  elementary treatment contrasts. The package also provides an optional method of
  using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package 'tcltk' to ensure that it is
  user friendly.
