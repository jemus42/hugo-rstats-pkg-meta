maintainer: Yaguang Li
description: A novel and fast two stage method for simultaneous multiple change point
  detection and variable selection for piecewise stationary autoregressive (PSAR)
  processes and linear regression model. It also simultaneously performs variable
  selection for each autoregressive model and hence the order selection.
