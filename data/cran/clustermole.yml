description: Assignment of cell type labels to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
  clusters is often a time-consuming process that involves manual inspection of the
  cluster marker genes complemented with a detailed literature search. This is especially
  challenging when unexpected or poorly described populations are present. The clustermole
  R package provides methods to query thousands of human and mouse cell identity markers
  sourced from a variety of databases.
