  Implementation of Parametric Formulas for Soil Water Retention
  or Conductivity Curve
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  It implements parametric formulas of soil
  water retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten
  (for soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity)
  were implemented.
