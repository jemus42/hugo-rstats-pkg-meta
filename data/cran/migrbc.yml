title: Production Rules Based Classification of Migration
maintainer: Leshi Chen
description: Provides mechanisms for classifying border crossings using a rules-based
  methodology. The goal of performing this type of classification is to identify any
  potential long-term migrants.  A long-term migration is defined as a border crossing
  involving a change in residence status. A border crossing counts as a long-term
  migration to/from a country if it entails a change from non-residence to residence
  / residence to non-residence.  The rules-based classification that used to determine
  a long-term migration is defined by a threshold duration and a test duration, alternatively
  named window size. Under a 12/16 rule, for instance, the threshold duration is 12
  months and the test duration (window size) is 16 months. With a 9/12 rule, the threshold
  duration is 9 months and the test duration (window size)  is 12 months. For more
  information about the methodology applied, please visit Stats NZ (2020) <https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/defining-migrants-using-travel-histories-and-the-1216-month-rule>.
