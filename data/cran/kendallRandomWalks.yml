  Simulate and Visualize Kendall Random Walks and Related
  Distributions

description: |-
  Kendall random walks are a continuous-space Markov chains generated
  by the Kendall generalized convolution. This package provides tools
  for simulating these random walks and studying distributions
  related to them. For more information about Kendall random walks see Jasiulis-Go≈Çdyn (2014) <arXiv:1412.0220>.
