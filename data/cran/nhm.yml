title: Non-Homogeneous Markov and Hidden Markov Multistate Models
maintainer: Andrew Titman
description: Fits non-homogeneous Markov multistate models and misclassification-type
  hidden Markov models in continuous time to intermittently observed data. Implements
  the methods in Titman (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01550.x>. Uses direct
  numerical solution of the Kolmogorov forward equations to calculate the transition
  probabilities.
