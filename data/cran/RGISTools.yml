description: Downloading, customizing, and processing time series of satellite images
  for a region of interest. 'RGISTools' functions allow a unified access to multispectral
  images from Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel repositories. 'RGISTools' also offers capabilities
  for customizing satellite images, such as tile mosaicking, image cropping and new
  variables computation. Finally, 'RGISTools' covers the processing, including cloud
  masking, compositing and gap-filling/smoothing time series of images (Militino et
  al., 2018 <doi:10.3390/rs10030398> and Militino et al., 2019 <doi:10.1109/TGRS.2019.2904193>).
