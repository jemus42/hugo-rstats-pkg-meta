title: Differential Gene Correlation Analysis
maintainer: Andrew McKenzie
description: |-
  Performs differential correlation analysis on input
  matrices, with multiple conditions specified by a design matrix. Contains
  functions to filter, process, save, visualize, and interpret differential
  correlations of identifier-pairs across the entire identifier space, or with
  respect to a particular set of identifiers (e.g., one). Also contains several
  functions to perform differential correlation analysis on clusters (i.e., modules)
  or genes. Finally, it contains functions to generate empirical p-values for the
  hypothesis tests and adjust them for multiple comparisons. Although the package
  was built with gene expression data in mind, it is applicable to other types of
  genomics data as well, in addition to being potentially applicable to data from
  other fields entirely. It is described more fully in the manuscript
  introducing it, freely available at <doi:10.1186/s12918-016-0349-1>.
