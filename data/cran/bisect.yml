  Estimating Cell Type Composition from Methylation Sequencing
  Data
maintainer: Eyal Fisher
description: An implementation of Bisect, a method for inferring cell type composition
  of samples based on methylation sequencing data (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing
  and Reduced Representation Sequencing). The method is specifically tailored for
  sequencing data, and therefore works better than methods developed for methylation
  arrays. It contains a supervised mode that requires a reference (the methylation
  probabilities in the pure cell types), and a semi-supervised mode, that requires
  cell counts for a subset of the samples, but does not require a reference.
