title: Spatial Analysis and Data Mining for Field Ecologists
maintainer: Patrick Giraudoux
description: Set of tools for reading, writing and transforming spatial and seasonal
  data in ecology, model selection and specific statistical tests. It includes functions
  to discretize polylines into regular point intervals, link observations to those
  points, compute geographical coordinates at regular intervals between waypoints,
  read subsets of big rasters, compute zonal statistics or table of categories within
  polygons or circular buffers from raster. The package also provides miscellaneous
  functions for model selection, spatial statistics, geometries, writing data.frame
  with Chinese characters, and some other functions for field ecologists.
