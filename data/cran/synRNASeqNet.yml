  Synthetic RNA-Seq Network Generation and Mutual Information
  Estimates
maintainer: Luciano Garofano
description: |-
  It implements various estimators of mutual information, such as
  the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian
  estimators, the shrinkage estimator, and the Chao-Shen estimator. It also
  offers wrappers to the kNN and kernel density estimators. Furthermore, it
  provides various index of performance evaluation such as precision, recall,
  FPR, F-Score, ROC-PR Curves and so on. Lastly, it provides a brand new way
  of generating synthetic RNA-Seq Network with known dependence structure.
