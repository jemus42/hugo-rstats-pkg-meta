title: LInear Regression in Astronomy
maintainer: Mauro Sereno
description: Performs Bayesian linear regression and forecasting in astronomy. The
  method accounts for heteroscedastic errors in both the independent and the dependent
  variables, intrinsic scatters (in both variables) and scatter correlation, time
  evolution of slopes, normalization, scatters, Malmquist and Eddington bias, upper
  limits and break of linearity. The posterior distribution of the regression parameters
  is sampled with a Gibbs method exploiting the JAGS library.
