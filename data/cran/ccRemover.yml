  Removes the Cell-Cycle Effect from Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing
  Data
maintainer: Jun Li
description: |-
  Implements a method for identifying and removing
  the cell-cycle effect from scRNA-Seq data. The description of the
  method is in Barron M. and Li J. (2016) <doi:10.1038/srep33892>. Identifying and removing
  the cell-cycle effect from single-cell RNA-Sequencing data. Submitted.
  Different from previous methods, ccRemover implements a mechanism that
  formally tests whether a component is cell-cycle related or not, and thus
  while it often thoroughly removes the cell-cycle effect, it preserves
  other features/signals of interest in the data.
