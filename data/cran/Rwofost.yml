description: An implementation of the WOFOST ("World Food Studies") crop growth model.
  WOFOST is a dynamic simulation model that uses daily weather data, and crop, soil
  and management parameters to simulate crop growth and development. See De Wit et
  al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.agsy.2018.06.018> for a recent review of the history and
  use of the model.
