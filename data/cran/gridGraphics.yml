title: Redraw Base Graphics Using 'grid' Graphics
maintainer: Paul Murrell
description: |-
  Functions to convert a page of plots drawn with the
  'graphics' package into identical output drawn with the 'grid' package.
  The result looks like the original 'graphics'-based plot, but consists
  of 'grid' grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with
  'grid' functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
