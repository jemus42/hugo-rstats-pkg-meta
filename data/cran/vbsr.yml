title: Variational Bayes Spike Regression Regularized Linear Models
maintainer: Benjamin Logsdon
description: |-
  Efficient algorithm for solving ultra-sparse
  regularized regression models using a variational
  Bayes algorithm with a spike (l0) prior.  Algorithm
  is solved on a path, with coordinate updates, and is
  capable of generating very sparse models.  There are
  very general model diagnostics for controling type-1
  error included in this package.
