title: Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Based on (Q)AIC(c)
maintainer: Marc J. Mazerolle
description: Functions to implement model selection and multimodel inference based
  on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the second-order AIC (AICc), as well
  as their quasi-likelihood counterparts (QAIC, QAICc) from various model object classes.  The
  package implements classic model averaging for a given parameter of interest or
  predicted values, as well as a shrinkage version of model averaging parameter estimates
  or effect sizes.  The package includes diagnostics and goodness-of-fit statistics
  for certain model types including those of 'unmarkedFit' classes estimating demographic
  parameters after accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some functions
  also allow the creation of model selection tables for Bayesian models of the 'bugs',
  'rjags', and 'jagsUI' classes.  Functions also implement model selection using BIC.  Objects
  following model selection and multimodel inference can be formatted to LaTeX using
  'xtable' methods included in the package.
