  Vaccine Data for Present
maintainer: Irucka Embry
description: |-
  Non-Domestic VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2016 - 06/14/2016. If
  you want to explore the full VAERS data for 1990 - Present (data, symptoms,
  and vaccines), then check out the 'vaersND' package from the URL below. The
  URL and BugReports below correspond to the 'vaersND' package, of which
  'vaersNDvax' is a small subset (2016 only). 'vaersND' is not hosted on CRAN
  due to the large size of the data set. To install the Suggested 'vaers' and
  'vaersND' packages, use the following R code:
  'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git",
  build_vignettes = TRUE)' and
  'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git",
  build_vignettes = TRUE)'. "VAERS is a national vaccine safety
  surveillance program co-sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS is a
  post-marketing safety surveillance program, collecting information about
  adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after the administration
  of vaccines licensed for use in the United States." For more information
  about the data, visit <https://vaers.hhs.gov/index>. For information about
  vaccination/immunization hazards, visit
