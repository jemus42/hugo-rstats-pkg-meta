description: |2-

  The merits of 'TIMESAT' and 'phenopix' are adopted. Besides, a simple and
  growing season dividing method and a practical snow elimination method
  based on Whittaker were proposed. 7 curve fitting methods and 4 phenology
  extraction methods were provided. Parameters boundary are considered for
  every curve fitting methods according to their ecological meaning.
  And 'optimx' is used to select best optimization method for different
  curve fitting methods.
