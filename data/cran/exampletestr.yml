title: Help for Writing Unit Tests Based on Function Examples
maintainer: Rory Nolan
description: |-
  Take the examples written in your documentation of
  functions and use them to create shells (skeletons which must be
  manually completed by the user) of test files to be tested with the
  'testthat' package. Sort of like python 'doctests' for R.
