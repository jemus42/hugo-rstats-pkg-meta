maintainer: Steven W. Kembel
description: Functions for phylocom integration, community analyses, null-models,
  traits and evolution. Implements numerous ecophylogenetic approaches including measures
  of community phylogenetic and trait diversity, phylogenetic signal, estimation of
  trait values for unobserved taxa, null models for community and phylogeny randomizations,
  and utility functions for data input/output and phylogeny plotting. A full description
  of package functionality and methods are provided by Kembel et al. (2010) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq166>.
