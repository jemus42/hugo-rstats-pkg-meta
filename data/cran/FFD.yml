title: Freedom from Disease
maintainer: Ian Kopacka
description: Functions, S4 classes/methods and a graphical user interface (GUI) to
  design surveys to substantiate freedom from disease using a modified hypergeometric
  function (see Cameron and Baldock, 1997). Herd sensitivities are computed according
  to sampling strategies "individual sampling" or "limited sampling" (see M. Ziller,
  T. Selhorst, J. Teuffert, M. Kramer and H. Schlueter, 2002). Methods to compute
  the a-posteriori alpha-error are implemented. Risk-based targeted sampling is supported.
