title: Flexible Univariate Count Models Based on Renewal Processes
maintainer: Tarak Kharrat
description: |-
  Flexible univariate count models based on renewal
  processes. The models may include covariates and can be specified
  with familiar formula syntax as in glm() and package 'flexsurv'.
  The methodology is described in a forthcoming paper in the Journal
  of Statistical Software <10.18637/jss.v090.i13> (included as
  vignette 'Countr_guide' in the package).
