title: Spectral Irradiance Data for Lamps
maintainer: Pedro J. Aphalo
description: |-
  Spectral emission data for some frequently used lamps excluding
  led emitting diodes (LEDs) available as electronic components. Original
  spectral irradiance data for incandescent-, LED- and discharge lamps are
  included. They are complemented by data on the effect of temperature on
  the emission by fluorescent tubes. Part of the 'r4photobiology' suite,
