title: Build 'data.table' Expressions with Data Manipulation Verbs
maintainer: Alexis Sarda-Espinosa
description: |-
  A specialization of 'dplyr' data manipulation verbs that parse and build expressions
  which are ultimately evaluated by 'data.table', letting it handle all optimizations. A set of
  additional verbs is also provided to facilitate some common operations on a subset of the data.
