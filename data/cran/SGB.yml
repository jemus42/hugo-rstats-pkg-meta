title: Simplicial Generalized Beta Regression
maintainer: Monique Graf
description: 'Main properties and regression procedures using a generalization of
  the Dirichlet distribution called Simplicial Generalized Beta distribution. It is
  a new distribution on the simplex (i.e. on the space of compositions or positive
  vectors with sum of components equal to 1). The Dirichlet distribution can be constructed
  from a random vector of independent Gamma variables divided by their sum. The SGB
  follows the same construction with generalized Gamma instead of Gamma variables.
  The Dirichlet exponents are supplemented by an overall shape parameter and a vector
  of scales. The scale vector is itself a composition and can be modeled with auxiliary
  variables through a log-ratio transformation. Graf, M. (2017, ISBN: 978-84-947240-0-8).
