version: 3.0.10
title: Methods for Dimension Reduction for Regression
maintainer: Sanford Weisberg
description: |-
  Functions, methods, and datasets for fitting dimension
  reduction regression, using slicing (methods SAVE and SIR), Principal
  Hessian Directions (phd, using residuals and the response), and an
  iterative IRE.  Partial methods, that condition on categorical
  predictors are also available.  A variety of tests, and stepwise
  deletion of predictors, is also included.  Also included is
  code for computing permutation tests of dimension.  Adding additional
  methods of estimating dimension is straightforward.
  For documentation, see the vignette in the package.   With version 3.0.4,
  the arguments for dr.step have been modified.
