  Generate Codes to Uniquely and Robustly Identify Individuals for
  Animal Behavior Studies
maintainer: Andrew Taylor Burchill
description: 'Facilitates the design and generation of optimal color (or symbol) codes
  that can be used to mark and identify individual animals. These codes are made such
  that the IDs are robust to partial erasure: even if sections of the code are lost,
  the entire identity of the animal can be reconstructed. Thus, animal subjects are
  not confused and no ambiguity is introduced.'
