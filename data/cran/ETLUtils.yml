  Utility Functions to Execute Standard Extract/Transform/Load
  Operations (using Package 'ff') on Large Data
maintainer: Jan Wijffels
description: |-
  Provides functions to facilitate the use of the 'ff' package
  in interaction with big data in 'SQL' databases (e.g. in 'Oracle', 'MySQL',
  'PostgreSQL', 'Hive') by allowing easy importing directly into 'ffdf' objects
  using 'DBI', 'RODBC' and 'RJDBC'. Also contains some basic utility functions to
  do fast left outer join merging based on 'match', factorisation of data and a
  basic function for re-coding vectors.
