  Optimal Row-Column Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray
  Experiments
maintainer: Dibaba Bayisa Gemechu
description: Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal row-column designs
  for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed
  effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all pairwise treatment contrasts.
  The algorithms used in this package are based on the array exchange and treatment
  exchange algorithms adopted from Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished)
  algorithms after adjusting for the row-column designs setup. The package also provides
  an optional method of using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package tcltk to
  ensure that it is user friendly.
