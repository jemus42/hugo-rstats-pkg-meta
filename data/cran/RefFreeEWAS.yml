title: EWAS using Reference-Free DNA Methylation Mixture Deconvolution
maintainer: E. Andres Houseman
description: |2-

  Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation
  arising as mixtures of cell types.  The older method
  (Houseman et al., 2014,<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029>) is similar to
  surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes additional use
  of a biological mixture assumption.
  The newer method (Houseman et al., 2016, <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4>) is similar
  to non-negative matrix factorization, with additional constraints
  and additional utilities.
