  The Accelerated Failure Time Model to Right Censored Data Based
  on Least-Squares Principle
maintainer: Arvin Satwani
description: |-
  Due to lack of proper inference procedure and software,
  the ordinary linear regression model is seldom used in practice
  for the analysis of right censored data. This paper presents an
  S-Plus/R program that implements a recently developed inference
  procedure (Jin, Lin and Ying, 2006) <doi:10.1093/biomet/93.1.147>
  for the accelerated failure time model based on the least-squares
  principle.
