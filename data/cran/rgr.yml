description: 'Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) functions for exploratory data analysis
  with applied geochemical data, with special application to the estimation of background
  ranges and identification of outliers, ''anomalies'', to support mineral exploration
  and environmental studies.  Additional functions are provided to support analytical
  data QA/QC, ANOVA for investigations of field sampling and analytical variability,
  and utility tasks.  NOTE: function caplot() for concentration-area plots employs
  package ''akima'', however, ''akima'' is only licensed for not-for-profit use.  Therefore,
  not-for-profit users of ''rgr'' will have to independently make package ''akima''
  available through library(....); and use of function caplot() by for-profit users
  will fail.'
