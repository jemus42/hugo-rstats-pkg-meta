title: Background Removal and Spectrum Identification for SERS Data
maintainer: Li Jun
description: |-
  Implements a new approach 'SABARSI' described in Wang et al., "A Statistical Approach of Background Removal and Spectrum Identification for SERS Data" (Unpublished).
  Sabarsi forms a pipeline for SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering) data analysis including background removal, signal detection, signal integration, and cross-experiment comparison. The background removal algorithm, the very first step of SERS data analysis, takes into account the change of background shape.
