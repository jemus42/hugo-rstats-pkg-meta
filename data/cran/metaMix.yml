title: Bayesian Mixture Analysis for Metagenomic Community Profiling
maintainer: Sofia Morfopoulou
description: |-
  Resolves complex metagenomic mixtures by analysing
  deep sequencing data, using a mixture model based approach.
  The use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration
  of the species space enables the identification of the set
  of species more likely to contribute to the mixture.
