  Nonparametric Smoothing for contaminated data using
  Simulation-Extrapolation
maintainer: Xiao-Feng Wang
description: 'This package contains a collection of functions to to perform nonparametric
  deconvolution using simulation extrapolation (SIMEX). We propose an estimator that
  adopts the SIMEX idea but bypasses the simulation step in the original SIMEX algorithm.
  There is no bandwidth parameter and the estimate is determined by appropriately
  selecting "design points". See details in: Wang, X.F., Sun, J. and Fan, Z. (2011).
  Deconvolution density estimation with heteroscedastic errors using SIMEX.'
