  Prediction Interval Functions for Assessing Replication Study
  Results
maintainer: David Stanley
description: |-
  A common problem faced by journal reviewers and authors is the question of
  whether the results of a replication study are consistent with the original
  published study. One solution to this problem is to examine the effect size
  from the original study and generate the range of effect sizes that could
  reasonably be obtained (due to random sampling) in a replication attempt
  (i.e., calculate a prediction interval). This package has functions that calculate
  the prediction interval for the correlation (i.e., r),
  standardized mean difference (i.e., d-value), and mean.
