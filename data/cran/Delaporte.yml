title: Statistical Functions for the Delaporte Distribution
maintainer: Avraham Adler
description: Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate generation,
  and method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the Delaporte distribution.
  The Delaporte is a discrete probability distribution which can be considered the
  convolution of a negative binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively,
  it can be considered a counting distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial
  components. It has been studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution
  which has more variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
