version: 1.0.0
title: The Composer of Plots
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for sequentially
  building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of multiple
  plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for
  arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others, providing
  mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages that try
  to address this need (but with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and
  'cowplot'.
