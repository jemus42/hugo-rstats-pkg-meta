  Product Density Estimation for ICA using tilted Gaussian density
  estimates
maintainer: Trevor Hastie
description: |-
  A direct and flexible method for estimating an ICA model.
  This approach estimates the densities for each component
  directly via a tilted gaussian. The tilt functions are
  estimated via a GAM poisson model. Details can be found in
  "Elements of Statistical Learning (2nd Edition)" Section 14.7.4
