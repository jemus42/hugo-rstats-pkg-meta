title: Facilities for Simulating from ODE-Based Models
maintainer: Wenping Wang
description: |-
  Facilities for running simulations from ordinary
  differential equation (ODE) models, such as pharmacometrics and other
  compartmental models.  A compilation manager translates the ODE model
  into C, compiles it, and dynamically loads the object code into R for
  improved computational efficiency.  An event table object facilitates
  the specification of complex dosing regimens (optional) and sampling
  schedules.  NB: The use of this package requires both C and
  Fortran compilers, for details on their use with R please see
  Section 6.3, Appendix A, and Appendix D in the "R Administration and
  Installation" manual. Also the code is mostly released under GPL.  The
  VODE and LSODA are in the public domain.  The information is available
  in the inst/COPYRIGHTS. You can also obtain the archived SnakeCharmR for
  python integration from CRAN archives
  <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/SnakeCharmR/> or
