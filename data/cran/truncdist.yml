title: Truncated Random Variables
maintainer: Frederick Novomestky
description: |-
  A collection of tools to evaluate probability density
  functions, cumulative distribution functions, quantile functions
  and random numbers for truncated random variables.  These functions are
  provided to also compute the expected value and variance. Nadarajah
  and Kotz (2006) developed most of the functions. QQ plots can be produced.
  All the probability functions in the stats, stats4 and evd
  packages are automatically available for truncation..
