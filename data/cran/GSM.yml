title: Gamma Shape Mixture
maintainer: Sergio Venturini
description: Implementation of a Bayesian approach for estimating a mixture of gamma
  distributions in which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter. This family provides
  a flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally
  efficient, and it only requires to specify a prior distribution for a single parameter.
