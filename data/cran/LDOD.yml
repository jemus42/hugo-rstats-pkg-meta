  generalized linear models.
maintainer: Ehsan Masoudi
description: |-
  this package provides functions for Finding Locally
  D-optimal designs for Logistic, Negative Binomial, Poisson,
  Michaelis-Menten, Exponential, Log-Linear, Emax, Richards,
  Weibull and Inverse Quadratic regression models and also
  functions for auto-constructing Fisher information matrix and
  Frechet derivative based on some input variables and without
  user-interfere.
