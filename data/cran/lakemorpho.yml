title: Lake Morphometry Metrics
maintainer: Jeffrey W. Hollister
description: |-
  Lake morphometry metrics are used by limnologists to understand,
  among other things, the ecological processes in a lake. Traditionally, these
  metrics are calculated by hand, with planimeters, and increasingly with
  commercial GIS products. All of these methods work; however, they are either
  outdated, difficult to reproduce, or require expensive licenses to use. The
  'lakemorpho' package provides the tools to calculate a typical suite
  of these metrics from an input elevation model and lake polygon. The metrics
  currently supported are: fetch, major axis, minor axis, major/minor axis
  ratio, maximum length, maximum width, mean width, maximum depth, mean depth,
  shoreline development, shoreline length, surface area, and volume.
