title: Shrinkage Discriminant Analysis and CAT Score Variable Selection
maintainer: Korbinian Strimmer
description: |-
  Provides an efficient framework for
  high-dimensional linear and diagonal discriminant analysis with
  variable selection.  The classifier is trained using James-Stein-type
  shrinkage estimators and predictor variables are ranked using
  correlation-adjusted t-scores (CAT scores).  Variable selection error
  is controlled using false non-discovery rates or higher criticism.
