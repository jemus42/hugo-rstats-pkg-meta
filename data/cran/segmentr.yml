title: Segment Data With Maximum Likelihood
maintainer: Thales Mello
description: |-
  Given a likelihood provided by the user, this package applies it
  to a given matrix dataset in order to find change points in the data that
  maximize the sum of the likelihoods of all the segments. This package provides
  a handful of algorithms with different time complexities and assumption compromises
  so the user is able to choose the best one for the problem at hand. The implementation
  of the segmentation algorithms in this package are based on the paper by Bruno M. de Castro,
  Florencia Leonardi (2018) <arXiv:1501.01756>. The Berlin
  weather sample dataset was provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst <https://dwd.de/>.
