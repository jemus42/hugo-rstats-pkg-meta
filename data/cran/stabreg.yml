title: Linear Regression with the Stable Distribution
maintainer: Oleg Kopylov
description: Efficient regression for heavy-tailed and skewed data following a stable
  distribution. Generalized regression where the skewness and tail parameter of residuals
  are dependent on regressors is also available. Includes fast calculation of stable
  densities. Calculation of densities is based on efficient numerical methods from
  Ament and O'Neil (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9725-y>. Parts of the code have
  been ported to C from Ament's 'Matlab' code available at <https://gitlab.com/s_ament/qastable>.
