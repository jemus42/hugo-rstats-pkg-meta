  Summarizes Provenance Related to Inputs and Outputs of a Script
  or Console Commands
maintainer: Barbara Lerner
description: |-
  Reads the provenance collected by the 'rdt' or
  'rdtLite' packages, or other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output
  created by the execution of a script, and provides a human-readable
  summary identifying the input and output files, the script used
  (if any), errors and warnings produced, and the environment in
  which it was executed.  It can also optionally package all the
  files into a zip file.  The exact format of the JSON created by
  'rdt' and 'rdtLite' is described in
  <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.
  More information about 'rdtLite' and associated tools is available
  at <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/> and Barbara Lerner,

  Provenance in R, Informatics, <doi: 10.3390/informatics5010012>.
