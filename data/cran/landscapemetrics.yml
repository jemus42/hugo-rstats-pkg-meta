title: Landscape Metrics for Categorical Map Patterns
maintainer: Maximillian H.K. Hesselbarth
description: |-
  Calculates landscape metrics for categorical landscape patterns in
  a tidy workflow. 'landscapemetrics' reimplements the most common metrics from
  'FRAGSTATS' (<https://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/fragstats.html>)
  and new ones from the current literature on landscape metrics.
  This package supports 'raster' spatial objects and takes
  RasterLayer, RasterStacks, RasterBricks or lists of RasterLayer from the
  'raster' package as input arguments. It further provides utility functions
  to visualize patches, select metrics and building blocks to develop new
  metrics.
