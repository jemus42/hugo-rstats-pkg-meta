title: Composite-Based Structural Equation Modeling
maintainer: Manuel E. Rademaker
description: |-
  Estimate, assess, test, and study linear, nonlinear, hierarchical
  and multigroup structural equation models using composite-based approaches
  and procedures, including estimation techniques such as partial least squares
  path modeling (PLS-PM) and its derivatives (PLSc, ordPLSc, robustPLSc),
  generalized structured component analysis (GSCA), generalized structured
  component analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm), generalized canonical
  correlation analysis (GCCA), principal component analysis (PCA),
  factor score regression (FSR) using sum score, regression or
  bartlett scores (including bias correction using Croonâ€™s approach),
  as well as several tests and typical postestimation procedures
  (e.g., verify admissibility of the estimates, assess the model fit,
  test the model fit etc.).
