title: Creating and Working with Pedigrees and Marker Data
maintainer: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
description: |-
  A lightweight, but comprehensive collection of tools for creating,
  manipulating and visualising pedigrees and genetic marker data. Pedigrees
  can be read from text files or created on the fly with built-in functions.
  A range of utilities enable modifications like adding or removing individuals,
  breaking loops, and merging pedigrees. Pedigree plots are produced by wrapping
  the plotting functionality of the 'kinship2' package.
