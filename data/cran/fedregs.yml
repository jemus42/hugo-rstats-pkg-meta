maintainer: Scott Large
description: |-
  The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) annual edition is the codification
  of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments
  and agencies of the Federal Government of the United States of America. Simply, the
  'fedregs' package facilitates word processing and sentiment analysis of the CFR using tidy
  principles. Note: According to the Code of Federal Regulations XML Rendition User Guide Document:
  "In general, there are no restrictions on re-use of information in Code of Federal Regulations
  material because U.S. Government works are not subject to copyright. OFR and GPO do not
  restrict downstream uses of Code of Federal Regulations data, except that independent providers
  should be aware that only the OFR and GPO are entitled to represent that they are the providers
  of the official versions of the Code of Federal Regulations and related Federal Register
  publications."
