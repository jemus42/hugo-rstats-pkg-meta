title: Approximate Maximisation of Nestedness in Bipartite Graphs
maintainer: Christoph  Hoeppke
description: |-
  Functions to generate graphs that maximise the NODF (nestedness metric based
  on overlap and decreasing fill) metric for a given number of rows, columns
  and links. NODF was originally defined by Almeida-Neto et al. (2008)
  <doi:10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16644.x>. As nestedness in ecological networks
  depends on the size of the networks we require normalisation to make them
  comparable. We offer three highly optimised algorithms to find the
  optimising graphs so that users can choose an appropriate trade off between
  computation time and NODF value for the task at hand.
