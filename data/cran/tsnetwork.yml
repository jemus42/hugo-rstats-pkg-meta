title: Constructing Dynamic Networks for Time-Series Data
maintainer: Pariya Behrouzi
description: |-
  Implements the method in Behrouzi, Abegaz, and Wit (2018) <arXiv:1805.09840> to learn
  intra-time and inter-time conditional independence networks for ordinal
  time-series data and mixed discrete-and-continuous time-series data.
  This package assumes a stationary process, where both instantaneous and
  dynamic networks stay fixed over time.
