title: Bayesian Inference for Causal Networks
maintainer: Evan A Martin
description: |-
  A Bayesian hybrid approach for inferring Directed Acyclic Graphs
  (DAGs) for continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The algorithm can use the
  graph inferred by another more efficient graph inference method as input;
  the input graph may contain false edges or undirected edges but can help
  reduce the search space to a more manageable size. A Bayesian Markov chain
  Monte Carlo algorithm is then used to infer the probability of direction and
  absence for the edges in the network.
