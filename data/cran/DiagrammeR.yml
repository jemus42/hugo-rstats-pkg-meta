description: |2-

  Build graph/network structures using functions for stepwise addition and
  deletion of nodes and edges. Work with data available in tables for bulk
  addition of nodes, edges, and associated metadata. Use graph selections
  and traversals to apply changes to specific nodes or edges. A wide
  selection of graph algorithms allow for the analysis of graphs. Visualize
  the graphs and take advantage of any aesthetic properties assigned to
  nodes and edges.
