title: Computation of the Orbit-Aware Quad Census
maintainer: Mark Ortmann
description: |-
  Implements the efficient algorithm by Ortmann and Brandes (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s41109-017-0027-2> to compute the orbit-aware frequency distribution of induced and non-induced quads, i.e. subgraphs of size four. Given an edge matrix, data frame, or a graph object (e.g., 'igraph'), the orbit-aware counts are computed respective each of the edges and nodes.
