title: Default Color Maps from 'matplotlib'
maintainer: Simon Garnier
description: |-
  Implementation of the 'viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma',
  'inferno', and 'cividis' color maps for 'R'. 'viridis', 'magma', 'plasma',
  and 'inferno' are ported from 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/>, a
  popular plotting library for 'python'. 'cividis', was developed by Jamie R.
  Nu√±ez and Sean M. Colby. These color maps are designed in such a way that
  they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular
  form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to
  be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness (all
  color maps in this package) and color vision deficiency ('cividis' only).
