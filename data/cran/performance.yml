title: Assessment of Regression Models Performance
maintainer: Daniel LÃ¼decke
description: |-
  Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality,
  which are not directly provided by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages. These
  include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation coefficient
  (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>),
  root mean squared error or functions to check models for overdispersion,
  singularity or zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of
  regression models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models
  and Bayesian models.
