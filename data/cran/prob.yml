title: Elementary Probability on Finite Sample Spaces
maintainer: G. Jay Kerns
description: |2-

  A framework for performing elementary probability
  calculations on finite sample spaces, which may be represented by data frames
  or lists.  Functionality includes setting up sample spaces, counting tools,
  defining probability spaces, performing set algebra, calculating probability
  and conditional probability, tools for simulation and checking the law of
  large numbers, adding random variables, and finding marginal distributions.
  Characteristic functions for all base R distributions are included.
