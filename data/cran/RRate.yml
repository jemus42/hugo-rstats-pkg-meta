title: Estimating Replication Rate for Genome-Wide Association Studies
maintainer: Wei Jiang
description: Replication Rate (RR) is the probability of replicating a statistically
  significant association in genome-wide association studies. This R-package provide
  the estimation method for replication rate which makes use of the summary statistics
  from the primary study. We can use the estimated RR to determine the sample size
  of the replication study, and to check the consistency between the results of the
  primary study and those of the replication study.
