title: Variable Selection Using Random Forests
maintainer: Robin Genuer
description: |-
  Three steps variable selection procedure based on random forests.
  Initially developed to handle high dimensional data (for which number of
  variables largely exceeds number of observations), the package is very
  versatile and can treat most dimensions of data, for regression and
  supervised classification problems. First step is dedicated to eliminate
  irrelevant variables from the dataset. Second step aims to select all
  variables related to the response for interpretation purpose. Third step
  refines the selection by eliminating redundancy in the set of variables
  selected by the second step, for prediction purpose.
