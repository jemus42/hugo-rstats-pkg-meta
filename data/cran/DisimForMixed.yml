maintainer: Hasanthi A. Pathberiya
description: Implement the methods proposed by Ahmad & Dey (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.datak.2007.03.016>
  in calculating the dissimilarity matrix at the presence of mixed attributes. This
  Package includes functions to discretize quantitative variables, calculate conditional
  probability for each pair of attribute values, distance between every pair of attribute
  values, significance of attributes, calculate dissimilarity between each pair of
  objects.
