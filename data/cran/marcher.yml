title: Migration and Range Change Estimation in R
maintainer: Eliezer Gurarie
description: 'A set of tools for likelihood-based estimation, model selection and
  testing of two- and three-range shift and migration models for animal movement data
  as described in Gurarie et al. (2017) <doi: 10.1111/1365-2656.12674>.  Provided
  movement data (X, Y and Time), including irregularly sampled data, functions estimate
  the time, duration and location of one or two range shifts, as well as the ranging
  area and auto-correlation structure of the movment.  Tests assess, for example,
  whether the shift was "significant", and whether a two-shift migration was a true
  return migration.'
