title: Periodicity Tests in Short Time Series
maintainer: A.I. McLeod
description: Implements p-value computations using an approximation to the cumulative
  distribution function for a variety of tests for periodicity. These tests include
  harmonic regression tests with normal and double exponential errors as well as modifications
  of Fisher's g test. An accompanying vignette illustrates the application of these
  tests.
