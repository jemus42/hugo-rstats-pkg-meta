title: PD-Clustering and Factor PD-Clustering
maintainer: Cristina Tortora
description: Probabilistic distance clustering (PD-clustering) is an iterative, distribution
  free, probabilistic clustering method. PD-clustering assigns units to a cluster
  according to their probability of membership, under the constraint that the product
  of the probability and the distance of each point to any cluster centre is a constant.
  PD-clustering is a flexible method that can be used with non-spherical clusters,
  outliers, or noisy data. PDQ is an extension of the algorithm for clusters of different
  size. GPDC and TPDC uses a dissimilarity measure based on densities. Factor PD-clustering
  (FPDC) is a recently proposed factor clustering method that involves a linear transformation
  of variables and a cluster optimizing the PD-clustering criterion. It works on high
  dimensional datasets.
