  Discovery
maintainer: Michal Draminski
description: MCFS-ID (Monte Carlo Feature Selection and Interdependency Discovery)
  is a Monte Carlo method-based tool for feature selection. It also allows for the
  discovery of interdependencies between the relevant features. MCFS-ID is particularly
  suitable for the analysis of high-dimensional, 'small n large p' transactional and
  biological data. M. Draminski, J. Koronacki (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i12>.
