title: Area-Proportional Euler and Venn Diagrams with Ellipses
maintainer: Johan Larsson
description: |-
  Generate area-proportional Euler diagrams
  using numerical optimization. An Euler diagram is a generalization of a Venn
  diagram, relaxing the criterion that all interactions need to be
  represented. Diagrams may be fit with ellipses and circles via
  a wide range of inputs and can be visualized in numerous ways.
