title: Cox Regression with Firth's Penalized Likelihood
maintainer: Georg Heinze
description: |-
  Implements Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for Cox regression
  which has been shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence of likelihood function).
  The program fits profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals which were proved to outperform
  Wald confidence intervals.
