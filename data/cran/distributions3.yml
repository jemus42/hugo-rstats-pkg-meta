title: Probability Distributions as S3 Objects
maintainer: Alex Hayes
description: |-
  Tools to create and manipulate probability
  distributions using S3.  Generics random(), pdf(), cdf() and
  quantile() provide replacements for base R's r/d/p/q style functions.
  Functions and arguments have been named carefully to minimize
  confusion for students in intro stats courses. The documentation for
  each distribution contains detailed mathematical notes.
