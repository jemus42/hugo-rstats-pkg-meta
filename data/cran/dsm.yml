title: Density Surface Modelling of Distance Sampling Data
maintainer: Laura Marshall
description: |-
  Density surface modelling of line transect data. A Generalized
  Additive Model-based approach is used to calculate spatially-explicit estimates
  of animal abundance from distance sampling (also presence/absence and strip
  transect) data. Several utility functions are provided for model checking,
  plotting and variance estimation.
