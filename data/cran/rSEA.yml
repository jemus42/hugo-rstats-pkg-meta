description: 'SEA performs simultaneous feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It
  tests the unified null hypothesis controls the family-wise error rate for all possible
  pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as: "The proportion of true features
  in the set is less than or equal to the threshold c", where c is selected by the
  user. Family-wise error rate control is provided through use of closed testing with
  Simes test. For more information on closed testing with Simes see Goeman et al.
  (2019) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asz041> and for more information about the properties
  and performance of SEA procedure see Ebrahimpoor et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbz074>.'
