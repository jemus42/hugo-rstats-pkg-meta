title: Model Based Diagnostics for Multivariate Cluster Analysis
maintainer: Mitchell Lyons
description: |-
  Assessment and diagnostics for comparing competing
  clustering solutions, using predictive models. The main intended
  use is for comparing clustering/classification solutions of
  ecological data (e.g. presence/absence, counts, ordinal scores) to
  1) find an optimal partitioning solution, 2) identify
  characteristic species and 3) refine a classification by merging
  clusters that increase predictive performance. However, in a more
  general sense, this package can do the above for any set of
  clustering solutions for i observations of j variables.
