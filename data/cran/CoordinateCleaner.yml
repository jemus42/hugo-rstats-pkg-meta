  Automated Cleaning of Occurrence Records from Biological
  Collections
maintainer: Alexander Zizka
description: 'Automated flagging of common spatial and temporal errors in biological
  and paleontological collection data, for the use in conservation, ecology and paleontology.
  Includes automated tests to easily flag (and exclude) records assigned to country
  or province centroid, the open ocean, the headquarters of the Global Biodiversity
  Information Facility, urban areas or the location of biodiversity institutions (museums,
  zoos, botanical gardens, universities). Furthermore identifies per species outlier
  coordinates, zero coordinates, identical latitude/longitude and invalid coordinates.
  Also implements an algorithm to identify data sets with a significant proportion
  of rounded coordinates. Especially suited for large data sets. The reference for
  the methodology is: Zizka et al. (2019) doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13152.'
