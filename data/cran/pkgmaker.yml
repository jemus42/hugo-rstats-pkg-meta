version: 0.31.1
title: Development Utilities for R Packages
maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux
description: |-
  Provides some low-level utilities to use for package
  development. It currently provides managers for multiple package specific
  options and registries, vignette, unit test and bibtex related utilities.
  It serves as a base package for packages like NMF, RcppOctave, doRNG, and
  as an incubator package for other general purposes utilities, that will
  eventually be packaged separately.
  It is still under heavy development and changes in the interface(s) are
  more than likely to happen.
