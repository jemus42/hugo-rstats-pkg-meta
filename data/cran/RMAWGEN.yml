title: Multi-Site Auto-Regressive Weather GENerator
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  S3 and S4 functions are implemented for spatial multi-site
  stochastic generation of daily time series of temperature and
  precipitation. These tools make use of Vector AutoRegressive models (VARs).
  The weather generator model is then saved as an object and is calibrated by
  daily instrumental "Gaussianized" time series through the 'vars' package
  tools. Once obtained this model, it can it can be used for weather
  generations and be adapted to work with several climatic monthly time
  series.
