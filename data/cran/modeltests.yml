version: 0.1.1
title: Testing Infrastructure for Broom Model Generics
maintainer: Alex Hayes
description: |-
  Provides a number of testthat tests that can be
  used to verify that tidy(), glance() and augment() methods meet
  consistent specifications. This allows methods for the same generic
  to be spread across multiple packages, since all of those packages
  can make the same guarantees to users about returned objects.
