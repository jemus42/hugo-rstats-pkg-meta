  Design-Based Global and Small-Area Estimations for Multiphase
  Forest Inventories
maintainer: Andreas Hill
description: |-
  Extensive global and small-area estimation procedures for multiphase
  forest inventories under the design-based Monte-Carlo approach are provided.
  The implementation includes estimators for simple and cluster sampling

  2013 (<DOI:10.1139/cjfr-2012-0381>, <DOI:10.1139/cjfr-2013-0181>,

  and 2016 (<DOI:10.3929/ethz-a-010579388>). It provides point estimates,
  their external- and design-based variances as well as confidence intervals.
  The procedures have also been optimized for the use of remote sensing data
  as auxiliary information.
