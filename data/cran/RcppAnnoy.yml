  'Rcpp' Bindings for 'Annoy', a Library for Approximate Nearest
  Neighbors
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  'Annoy' is a small C++ library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
  written for efficient memory usage as well an ability to load from / save to
  disk. This package provides an R interface by relying on the 'Rcpp' package,
  exposing the same interface as the original Python wrapper to 'Annoy'. See
  <https://github.com/spotify/annoy> for more on 'Annoy'. 'Annoy' is released
  under Version 2.0 of the Apache License. Also included is a small Windows
  port of 'mmap' which is released under the MIT license.
