title: C++11 Header Files for 'cereal'
maintainer: Wush Wu
description: |-
  To facilitate using 'cereal' with Rcpp.
  'cereal' is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
  'cereal' takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into
  different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML,
  or JSON. 'cereal' was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy
  to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily
  bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see
  <http://uscilab.github.io/cereal> for more information.
