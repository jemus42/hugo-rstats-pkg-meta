title: Clonality Estimates in Tumor
maintainer: Davide Prandi
description: 'Analyze data from next-generation sequencing experiments on genomic
  samples. ''CLONETv2'' offers a set of functions to compute allele specific copy
  number and clonality from segmented data and SNPs position pileup. The package has
  also calculated the clonality of single nucleotide variants given read counts at
  mutated positions. The package has been developed at the laboratory of Computational
  and Functional Oncology, Department of CIBIO, University of Trento (Italy), under
  the supervision of prof Francesca Demichelis. References: Prandi et al. (2014) <doi:10.1186/s13059-014-0439-6>;
