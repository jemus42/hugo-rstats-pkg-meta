title: EcoTroph R package
maintainer: Jerome Guitton
description: EcoTroph is an approach and software for modelling marine and freshwater
  ecosystems. It is articulated entirely around trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays
  are bivariate plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or related
  quantities as ordinates. Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be modelled as
  a continuous flow of biomass surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic
  levels, due to predation and ontogenic processes. Such an approach, wherein species
  as such disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic
  level metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but potentially useful
  caricature of ecosystem functioning and impacts of fishing. This version contains
  catch trophic spectrum analysis (CTSA) function and corrected versions of the mf.diagnosis
  and create.ETmain functions.
