title: Matrix Completion via Iterative Soft-Thresholded SVD
maintainer: Trevor Hastie
description: Iterative methods for matrix completion that use nuclear-norm regularization.
  There are two main approaches.The one approach uses iterative soft-thresholded svds
  to impute the missing values. The second approach uses alternating least squares.
  Both have an "EM" flavor, in that at each iteration the matrix is completed with
  the current estimate. For large matrices there is a special sparse-matrix class
  named "Incomplete" that efficiently handles all computations. The package includes
  procedures for centering and scaling rows, columns or both, and for computing low-rank
  SVDs on large sparse centered matrices (i.e. principal components)
