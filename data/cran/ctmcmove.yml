  Modeling Animal Movement with Continuous-Time Discrete-Space
  Markov Chains
maintainer: Ephraim Hanks
description: Software to facilitates taking movement data in xyt format and pairing
  it with raster covariates within a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) framework.  As
  described in Hanks et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1214/14-AOAS803> , this allows flexible
  modeling of movement in response to covariates (or covariate gradients) with model
  fitting possible within a Poisson GLM framework.
