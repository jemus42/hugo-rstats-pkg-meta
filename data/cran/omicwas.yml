title: Cell-Type-Specific Association Testing in Bulk Omics Experiments
maintainer: Fumihiko Takeuchi
description: |-
  In bulk epigenome/transcriptome experiments, molecular expression
  is measured in a tissue, which is a mixture of multiple types of cells.
  This package tests association of a disease/phenotype with a molecular marker
  for each cell type.
  The proportion of cell types in each sample needs to be given as input.
  The package is applicable to epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of
  microarray experiments.
