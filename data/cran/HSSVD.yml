title: Biclustering with Heterogeneous Variance
maintainer: Guanhua Chen
description: A data mining tool for discovering subgroups of patients and genes that
  simultaneously display unusual levels of variability compared to other genes and
  patients. Based on sparse singular value decomposition (SSVD), the method can detect
  both mean and variance biclusters in the presence of heterogeneous residual variance.
