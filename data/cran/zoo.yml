  S3 Infrastructure for Regular and Irregular Time Series (Z's
  Ordered Observations)
maintainer: Achim Zeileis
description: |-
  An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
  observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time series
  of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key design goals
  are independence of a particular index/date/time class and
  consistency with ts and base R by providing methods to extend
  standard generics.
