title: Pricing Equity Derivatives with Extensions of Black-Scholes
maintainer: Brian K. Boonstra
description: |-
  Algorithms to price American and European
  equity options, convertible bonds and a
  variety of other financial derivatives. It uses an
  extension of the usual Black-Scholes model in which
  jump to default may occur at a probability specified
  by a power-law link between stock price and hazard
  rate as found in the paper by Takahashi, Kobayashi,
  and Nakagawa (2001) <doi:10.3905/jfi.2001.319302>.  We
  use ideas and techniques from Andersen and
  Buffum (2002) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.355308> and
  Linetsky (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9965.2006.00271.x>.
