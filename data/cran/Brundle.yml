  Normalisation Tools for Inter-Condition Variability of ChIP-Seq
  Data
maintainer: Andrew N Holding
description: Inter-sample condition variability is a key challenge of normalising
  ChIP-seq data. This implementation uses either spike-in or a second factor as a
  control for normalisation. Input can either be from 'DiffBind' or a matrix formatted
  for 'DESeq2'. The output is either a 'DiffBind' object or the default 'DESeq2' output.
  Either can then be processed as normal. Supporting manuscript Guertin, Markowetz
  and Holding (2017) <doi:10.1101/182261>.
