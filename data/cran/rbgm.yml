  Tools for 'Box Geometry Model' (BGM) Files and Topology for the
  Atlantis Ecosystem Model
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Facilities for working with Atlantis box-geometry model (BGM)
  files. Atlantis is a deterministic, biogeochemical, whole-of-ecosystem model.
  Functions are provided to read from BGM files directly, preserving their
  internal topology, as well as helper functions to generate spatial data from these
  mesh forms. This functionality aims to simplify the creation and modification of box
  and geometry as well as the ability to integrate with other data sources.
