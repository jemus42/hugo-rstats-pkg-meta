title: Joint Discretization of Data on a Grid that Preserves Clusters
maintainer: Joe Song
description: |-
  Discretize multivariate continuous data using a grid
  that captures the joint distribution via preserving clusters in
  the original data. Joint grid discretization is applicable as a
  data transformation step before using other methods to infer
  association, function, or causality without assuming a
  parametric model.
