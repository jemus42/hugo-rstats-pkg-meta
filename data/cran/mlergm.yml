title: Multilevel Exponential-Family Random Graph Models
maintainer: Jonathan Stewart
description: 'Estimates exponential-family random graph models for multilevel network
  data, assuming the multilevel structure is observed. The scope, at present, covers
  multilevel models where the set of nodes is nested within known blocks. The estimation
  method uses Monte-Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMLE) methods to estimate
  a variety of canonical or curved exponential family models for binary random graphs.
  MCMLE methods for curved exponential-family random graph models can be found in
  Hunter and Handcock (2006) <DOI: 10.1198/106186006X133069>. The package supports
  parallel computing, and provides methods for assessing goodness-of-fit of models
  and visualization of networks.'
