description: |-
  Miscellaneous R functions developed as collateral damage over the
  course of work in statistical and scientific computing for research. These
  include, for example, utilities that supplement existing idiosyncrasies of
  the R language, extend existing plotting functionality and aesthetics, help
  prepare data objects for imputation, and extend access to command line tools
  and systems-level information.
