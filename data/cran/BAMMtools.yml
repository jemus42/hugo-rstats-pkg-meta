  Analysis and Visualization of Macroevolutionary Dynamics on
  Phylogenetic Trees
maintainer: Pascal Title
description: |-
  Provides functions for analyzing and visualizing complex
  macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenetic trees. It is a companion
  package to the command line program BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of
  Macroevolutionary Mixtures) and is entirely oriented towards the analysis,
  interpretation, and visualization of evolutionary rates. Functionality
  includes visualization of rate shifts on phylogenies, estimating
  evolutionary rates through time, comparing posterior distributions of
  evolutionary rates across clades, comparing diversification models using
  Bayes factors, and more.
