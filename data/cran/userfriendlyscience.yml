title: Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible
maintainer: Gjalt-Jorn Peters
description: |-
  Contains a number of functions that serve
  two goals. First, to make R more accessible to people migrating
  from SPSS by adding a number of functions that behave roughly like
  their SPSS equivalents (also see <https://rosettastats.com>). Second,
  to make a number of slightly more advanced functions more user
  friendly to relatively novice users. The package also conveniently
  houses a number of additional functions that are intended to
  increase the quality of methodology and statistics in psychology,
  not by offering technical solutions, but by shifting perspectives,
  for example towards reasoning based on sampling distributions as
  opposed to on point estimates.
