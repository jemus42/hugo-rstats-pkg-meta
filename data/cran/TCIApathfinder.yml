title: Client for the Cancer Imaging Archive REST API
maintainer: Pamela Russell
description: |-
  A wrapper for The Cancer Imaging Archive's REST API. The Cancer
  Imaging Archive (TCIA) hosts de-identified medical images of cancer
  available for public download, as well as rich metadata for each image
  series. TCIA provides a REST API for programmatic access to the data.
  This package provides simple functions to access each API endpoint.
