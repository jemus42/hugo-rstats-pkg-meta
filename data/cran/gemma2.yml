title: GEMMA Multivariate Linear Mixed Model
maintainer: Frederick Boehm
description: Fits a multivariate linear mixed effects model that uses a polygenic
  term, after Zhou & Stephens (2014) (<https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2848>).
  Of particular interest is the estimation of variance components with restricted
  maximum likelihood (REML) methods. Genome-wide efficient mixed-model association
  (GEMMA), as implemented in the package 'gemma2', uses an expectation-maximization
  algorithm for variance components inference for use in quantitative trait locus
  studies.
