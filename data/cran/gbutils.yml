  Simulation of Real and Complex Numbers and Small Programming
  Utilities
maintainer: Georgi N. Boshnakov
description: |-
  Simulate real and complex numbers from distributions of their
  magnitude and arguments. Optionally, the magnitudes and/or arguments may
  be fixed in almost arbitrary ways. Plot density and distribution
  functions with automatic selection of suitable regions.  Small programming
  utilities: check if an object is identical to NA, count positional
  arguments in a call, set intersection of more than two sets, check if an
  argument is unnamed, compute the graph of S4 classes in packages.
