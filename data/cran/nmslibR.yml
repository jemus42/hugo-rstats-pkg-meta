version: 1.0.4
title: Non Metric Space (Approximate) Library
maintainer: Lampros Mouselimis
description: A Non-Metric Space Library ('NMSLIB' <https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib>)
  wrapper, which according to the authors "is an efficient cross-platform similarity
  search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. The goal
  of the 'NMSLIB' <https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib> Library is to create an
  effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching in generic non-metric spaces.
  Being comprehensive is important, because no single method is likely to be sufficient
  in all cases. Also note that exact solutions are hardly efficient in high dimensions
  and/or non-metric spaces. Hence, the main focus is on approximate methods". The
  wrapper also includes Approximate Kernel k-Nearest-Neighbor functions based on the
  'NMSLIB' <https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib> 'Python' Library.
