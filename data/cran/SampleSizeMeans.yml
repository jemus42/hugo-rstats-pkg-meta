title: Sample size calculations for normal means
maintainer: Lawrence Joseph
description: |-
  A set of R functions for calculating sample size
  requirements using three different Bayesian criteria in the
  context of designing an experiment to estimate a normal mean or
  the difference between two normal means.  Functions for
  calculation of required sample sizes for the Average Length
  Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion and the Worst Outcome
  Criterion in the context of normal means are provided.
  Functions for both the fully Bayesian and the mixed
  Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided.
