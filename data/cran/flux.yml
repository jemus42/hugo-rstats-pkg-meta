title: Flux rate calculation from dynamic closed chamber measurements
maintainer: Gerald Jurasinski
description: |-
  Functions for the calculation of greenhouse gas flux rates
  from closed chamber concentration measurements. The package follows
  a modular concept: Fluxes can be calculated in just two simple steps
  or in several steps if more control in details is wanted. Additionally
  plot and preparation functions as well as functions for modelling
  gpp and reco are provided.
