description: |-
  Extreme Gradient Boosting, which is an efficient implementation
  of the gradient boosting framework from Chen & Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785>.
  This package is its R interface. The package includes efficient linear
  model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically
  do parallel computation on a single machine which could be more than 10
  times faster than existing gradient boosting packages. It supports
  various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.
  The package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define
  their own objectives easily.
