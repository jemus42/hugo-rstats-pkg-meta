  'ggplot2' Based Tool to Facilitate Diagnostic Plots for NLME
  Models
maintainer: Matthew Fidler
description: |-
  At Novartis, we aimed at standardizing the set of diagnostic plots used for modeling
  activities in order to reduce the overall effort required for generating such plots.
  For this, we developed a guidance that proposes an adequate set of diagnostics and a toolbox,
  called 'ggPMX' to execute them. 'ggPMX' is a toolbox that can generate all diagnostic plots at a quality sufficient
  for publication and submissions using few lines of code.
