title: Hierarchical Bayesian Model for a Hazard Function
maintainer: Andrew Chapple
description: |-
  Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a
  Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive
  formulation for the spatial dependency in the hazard rates for each piece.
  This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of split
  points to vary. This function outputs graphics that display the histogram of
  the number of split points and the trace plots of the hierarchical parameters.
  The function outputs a list that contains the posterior samples for the number
  of split points, the location of the split points, and the log hazard rates
  corresponding to these splits. Additionally, this outputs the posterior samples
  of the two hierarchical parameters, Mu and Sigma^2.
