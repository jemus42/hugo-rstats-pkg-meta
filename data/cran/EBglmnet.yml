  Empirical Bayesian Lasso and Elastic Net Methods for Generalized
  Linear Models
maintainer: Anhui Huang
description: Provides empirical Bayesian lasso and elastic net algorithms for variable
  selection and effect estimation. Key features include sparse variable selection
  and effect estimation via generalized linear regression models, high dimensionality
  with p>>n, and significance test for nonzero effects. This package outperforms other
  popular methods such as lasso and elastic net methods in terms of power of detection,
  false discovery rate, and power of detecting grouping effects.
