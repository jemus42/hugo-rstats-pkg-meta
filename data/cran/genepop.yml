title: Population Genetic Data Analysis Using Genepop
maintainer: Fran√ßois Rousset
description: 'Makes the Genepop software available in R. This software implements
  a mixture of traditional population genetic methods and some more focused developments:
  it computes exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, for population differentiation
  and for genotypic disequilibrium among pairs of loci; it computes estimates of F-statistics,
  null allele frequencies, allele size-based statistics for microsatellites, etc.;
  and it performs analyses of isolation by distance from pairwise comparisons of individuals
  or population samples.'
