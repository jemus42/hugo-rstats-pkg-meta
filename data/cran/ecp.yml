  Data
maintainer: Wenyu Zhang
description: |-
  Implements various procedures for finding
  multiple change-points. Two methods make use of dynamic
  programming and pruning, with no distributional
  assumptions other than the existence of certain absolute
  moments in one method. Hierarchical and exact search methods
  are included. All methods return the set of estimated change-
  points as well as other summary information.
