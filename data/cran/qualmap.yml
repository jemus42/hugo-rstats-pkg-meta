description: |-
  Provides a set of functions for taking qualitative GIS data, hand drawn on a map, and
  converting it to a simple features object. These tools are focused on data that are drawn on a map
  that contains some type of polygon features. For each area identified on the map, the id numbers
  of these polygons can be entered as vectors and transformed using qualmap.
