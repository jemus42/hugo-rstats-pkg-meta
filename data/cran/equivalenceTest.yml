title: Equivalence Test for the Means of Two Normal Distributions
maintainer: Chao Wang
description: Two methods for performing equivalence test for the means of two (test
  and reference) normal distributions are implemented. The null hypothesis of the
  equivalence test is that the absolute difference between the two means are greater
  than or equal to the equivalence margin and the alternative is that the absolute
  difference is less than the margin. Given that the margin is often difficult to
  obtain a priori, it is assumed to be a constant multiple of the standard deviation
  of the reference distribution. The first method assumes a fixed margin which is
  a constant multiple of the estimated standard deviation of the reference data and
  whose variability is ignored. The second method takes into account the margin variability.
  In addition, some tools to summarize and illustrate the data and test results are
  included to facilitate the evaluation of the data and interpretation of the results.
