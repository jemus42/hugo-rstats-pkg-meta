  Port of the 'Scilab' 'n1qn1' and 'qnbd' Modules for
  (Un)constrained BFGS Optimization
maintainer: Matthew Fidler
description: |-
  Provides 'Scilab' 'n1qn1', or Quasi-Newton BFGS
  "qn" without constraints and 'qnbd' or Quasi-Newton BFGS with constraints.
  This takes more memory than traditional L-BFGS.  The n1qn1 routine is useful since it allows prespecification of a Hessian.
  If the Hessian is near enough the truth in optimization it can speed up the optimization problem. Both algorithms are described in the
  'Scilab' optimization documentation located at
  <https://www.scilab.org/sites/default/files/optimization_in_scilab.pdf>.
