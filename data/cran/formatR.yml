title: Format R Code Automatically
maintainer: Yihui Xie
description: |-
  Provides a function tidy_source() to format R source code. Spaces
  and indent will be added to the code automatically, and comments will be
  preserved under certain conditions, so that R code will be more
  human-readable and tidy. There is also a Shiny app as a user interface in
  this package (see tidy_app()).
