title: Poly-Omic Prediction of Complex TRaits
maintainer: Hae Kyung Im
description: |-
  It provides functions to generate a correlation matrix
  from a genetic dataset and to use this matrix to predict the phenotype of an
  individual by using the phenotypes of the remaining individuals through
  kriging. Kriging is a geostatistical method for optimal prediction or best
  unbiased linear prediction. It consists of predicting the value of a
  variable at an unobserved location as a weighted sum of the variable at
  observed locations. Intuitively, it works as a reverse linear regression:
  instead of computing correlation (univariate regression coefficients are
  simply scaled correlation) between a dependent variable Y and independent
  variables X, it uses known correlation between X and Y to predict Y.
