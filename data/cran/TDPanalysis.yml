title: Granier's Sap Flow Sensors (TDP) Analysis
maintainer: Maxime Durand
description: |-
  Set of functions designed to help in the
  analysis of TDP sensors. Features includes dates and time conversion, weather
  data interpolation, daily maximum of tension analysis and calculations required
  to convert sap flow density data to sap flow rates at the tree and plot scale (For more information see : Granier (1985) <DOI:10.1051/forest:19850204> & Granier (1987) <DOI:10.1093/treephys/3.4.309>).
