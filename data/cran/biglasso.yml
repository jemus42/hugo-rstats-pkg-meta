title: Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data
maintainer: Yaohui Zeng
description: |-
  Extend lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional,
  multi-gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's much more
  memory- and computation-efficient as compared to existing lasso-fitting packages
  like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg', thus allowing for very powerful big data analysis
  even with an ordinary laptop.
