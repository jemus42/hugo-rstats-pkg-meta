version: 0.6.0
title: Fast Probabilistic Record Linkage with Missing Data
maintainer: Ted Enamorado
description: |-
  Implements a Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model that allows for missing data
  and the inclusion of auxiliary information. This includes functionalities to conduct a merge of two
  datasets under the Fellegi-Sunter model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition,
  tools for preparing, adjusting, and summarizing data merges are included. The package implements methods
  described in Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (2019) ''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of
  Large-scale Administrative Records'', American Political Science Review and is available
  at <http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/linkage.html>.
