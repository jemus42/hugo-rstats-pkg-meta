title: Helpers for Developing Command Line Interfaces
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  A suite of tools to build attractive command line interfaces
  ('CLIs'), from semantic elements: headings, lists, alerts, paragraphs,
  etc. Supports custom themes via a 'CSS'-like language. It also contains a
  number of lower level 'CLI' elements: rules, boxes, trees, and
  'Unicode' symbols with 'ASCII' alternatives. It integrates with the
  'crayon' package to support 'ANSI' terminal colors.
