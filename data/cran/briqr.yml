title: Interface to the 'Briq' API
maintainer: David Rubinger
description: |-
  An interface to the 'Briq' API <https://briq.github.io>. 'Briq' is
  a tool that aims to promote employee engagement by helping employees
  recognize and reward each other. Employees can praise and thank one another
  (for achieving a company goal, for example) by giving virtual credits (known
  as 'briqs' or 'bqs') that can be redeemed for various rewards. The 'Briq'
  API lets you create, read, update and delete users, user groups,
  transactions and messages. This package provides functions that simplify
  getting the users, user groups and transactions of your organization into R.
