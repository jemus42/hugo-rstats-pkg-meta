title: RNA Secondary Structure Module Mining, Comparison and Plotting
maintainer: Zheng HeWei<zhenghw@hrbmu.edu.cn>
description: 'Provides function for RNA secondary structure plotting, comparison and
  module mining. Given a RNA secondary structure, you can obtain stem regions, hairpin
  loops, internal loops, bulge loops and multibranch loops of this RNA structure using
  this program. They are the basic modules of RNA secondary structure. For each module
  you get, you can use this program to label the RNA structure with a specific color.
  You can also use this program to compare two RNA secondary structures to get a score
  that represents similarity. Reference: Reuter JS, Mathews DH (2010) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-129>.'
