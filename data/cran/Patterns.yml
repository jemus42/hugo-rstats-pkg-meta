  Deciphering Biological Networks with Patterned Heterogeneous
  Measurements
maintainer: Frederic Bertrand
description: A modeling tool dedicated to biological network modeling. It allows for
  single or joint modeling of, for instance, genes and proteins. It starts with the
  selection of the actors that will be the used in the reverse engineering upcoming
  step. An actor can be included in that selection based on its differential measurement
  (for instance gene expression or protein abundance) or on its time course profile.
  Wrappers for actors clustering functions and cluster analysis are provided. It also
  allows reverse engineering of biological networks taking into account the observed
  time course patterns of the actors. Many inference functions are provided and dedicated
  to get specific features for the inferred network such as sparsity, robust links,
  high confidence links or stable through resampling links. Some simulation and prediction
  tools are also available for cascade networks. Example of use with microarray or
  RNA-Seq data are provided.
