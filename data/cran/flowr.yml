title: Streamlining Design and Deployment of Complex Workflows
maintainer: Sahil Seth
description: |-
  This framework allows you to design and implement complex
  pipelines, and deploy them on your institution's computing cluster. This has
  been built keeping in mind the needs of bioinformatics workflows. However, it is
  easily extendable to any field where a series of steps (shell commands) are to
  be executed in a (work)flow.
