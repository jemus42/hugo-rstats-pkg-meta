title: NeuroAnatomy Toolbox for Analysis of 3D Image Data
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  NeuroAnatomy Toolbox (nat) enables analysis and visualisation of 3D
  biological image data, especially traced neurons. Reads and writes 3D images
  in NRRD and 'Amira' AmiraMesh formats and reads surfaces in 'Amira' hxsurf
  format. Traced neurons can be imported from and written to SWC and 'Amira'
  LineSet and SkeletonGraph formats. These data can then be visualised in 3D
  via 'rgl', manipulated including applying calculated registrations, e.g.
  using the 'CMTK' registration suite, and analysed. There is also a simple
  representation for neurons that have been subjected to 3D skeletonisation
  but not formally traced; this allows morphological comparison between
  neurons including searches and clustering (via the 'nat.nblast' extension
  package).
