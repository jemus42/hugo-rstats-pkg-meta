  Variable Selection in Clustering by Mixture Models for Discrete
  Data
maintainer: Wilson Toussile
description: An implementation of a variable selection procedure in clustering by
  mixture models for discrete data (clustMMDD). Genotype data are examples of such
  data with two unordered observations (alleles) at each locus for diploid individual.
  The two-fold problem of variable selection and clustering is seen as a model selection
  problem where competing models are characterized by the number of clusters K, and
  the subset S of clustering variables. Competing models are compared by penalized
  maximum likelihood criteria. We considered asymptotic criteria such as Akaike and
  Bayesian Information criteria, and a family of penalized criteria with penalty function
  to be data driven calibrated.
