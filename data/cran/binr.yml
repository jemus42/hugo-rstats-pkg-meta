title: Cut Numeric Values into Evenly Distributed Groups
maintainer: Sergei Izrailev
description: |-
  Implementation of algorithms for cutting numerical values
  exhibiting a potentially highly skewed distribution into evenly distributed
  groups (bins). This functionality can be applied for binning discrete
  values, such as counts, as well as for discretization of continuous values,
  for example, during generation of features used in machine learning
  algorithms.
