  Tools for Fast Computing and Plotting Euclidean Minimum Spanning
  Trees
maintainer: Allan Quadros
description: |-
  Computes Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees (EMST) using the fast
  Dual-Tree Boruvka algorithm (March, Ram, Gray, 2010,
  <doi:10.1145/1835804.1835882>) implemented in 'mlpack' - the C++ Machine
  Learning library (Curtin et al., 2013). 'emstreeR' heavily relies on
  'RcppMLPACK' and 'Rcpp', working as a wrapper to the C++ fast EMST
  algorithm. Thus, R users do not have to deal with the R-'Rcpp'-C++
  integration. The package also provides functions and an S3 method for
  readily plotting Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) using either 'base' R,
  'scatterplot3d' or 'ggplot2' style.
