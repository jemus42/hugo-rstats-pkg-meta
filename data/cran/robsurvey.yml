title: Robust Survey Statistics Estimation
maintainer: Martin Sterchi
description: |-
  Multiple functions to compute robust survey statistics. The package
  supports the computations of robust means, totals, and ratios. Available
  methods are Huber M-estimators, trimming, and winsorization. The package
  'robsurvey' complements the 'survey' package. The package additionally
  includes a weighted version of the resistant line function of base R (line()),
  as well as two median based simple regression estimators. The methods are
  described in Hulliger (1995)
