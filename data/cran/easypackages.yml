title: Easy Loading and Installing of Packages
maintainer: Jake Sherman
description: |-
  Easily load and install multiple packages from different sources,
  including CRAN and GitHub. The libraries function allows you to load or attach
  multiple packages in the same function call. The packages function will load one
  or more packages, and install any packages that are not installed on your system
  (after prompting you). Also included is a from_import function that allows you
  to import specific functions from a package into the global environment.
