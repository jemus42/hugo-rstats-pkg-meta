title: Minimum Distance Estimation in Linear Regression Model
maintainer: Jiwoong Kim
description: Consider linear regression model Y = Xb + error where the distribution
  function of errors is unknown, but errors are independent and symmetrically distributed.
  The package contains a function named LRMDE which takes Y and X as input and returns
  minimum distance estimator of parameter b in the model.
