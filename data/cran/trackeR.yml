  Infrastructure for Running, Cycling and Swimming Data from
  GPS-Enabled Tracking Devices
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: 'Provides infrastructure for handling running, cycling and swimming data
  from GPS-enabled tracking devices within R. The package provides methods to extract,
  clean and organise workout and competition data into session-based and unit-aware
  data objects of class ''trackeRdata'' (S3 class). The information can then be visualised,
  summarised, and analysed through flexible and extensible methods. Frick and Kosmidis
  (2017) <doi: 10.18637/jss.v082.i07>, which is updated and maintained as one of the
  vignettes, provides detailed descriptions of the package and its methods, and real-data
  demonstrations of the package functionality.'
