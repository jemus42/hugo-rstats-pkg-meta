  Calculation for Single Arm Group Sequential Test with Binary
  Endpoint
maintainer: Lei Wang
description: Consider an at-most-K-stage group sequential design with only an upper
  bound for the last analysis and non-binding lower bounds.With binary endpoint, two
  kinds of test can be applied, asymptotic test based on normal distribution and exact
  test based on binomial distribution. This package supports the computation of boundaries
  and conditional power for single-arm group sequential test with binary endpoint,
  via either asymptotic or exact test. The package also provides functions to obtain
  boundary crossing probabilities given the design.
