  Elicitation of Independent Conditional Means Priors for
  Generalised Linear Models
maintainer: Geoff Hosack
description: Functions are provided to facilitate prior elicitation for Bayesian generalised
  linear models using independent conditional means priors. The package supports the
  elicitation of multivariate normal priors for generalised linear models. The approach
  can be applied to indirect elicitation for a generalised linear model that is linear
  in the parameters. The package is designed such that the facilitator executes functions
  within the R console during the elicitation session to provide graphical and numerical
  feedback at each design point. Various methodologies for eliciting fractiles (equivalently,
  percentiles or quantiles) are supported, including versions of the approach of Hosack
  et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.ress.2017.06.011>. For example, experts may be asked
  to provide central credible intervals that correspond to a certain probability.
  Or experts may be allowed to vary the probability allocated to the central credible
  interval for each design point. Additionally, a median may or may not be elicited.
