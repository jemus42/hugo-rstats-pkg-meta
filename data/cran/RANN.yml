  Fast Nearest Neighbour Search (Wraps ANN Library) Using L2
  Metric
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a given dataset
  in O(N log N) time using Arya and Mount's ANN library (v1.1.3). There is
  support for approximate as well as exact searches, fixed radius searches
  and 'bd' as well as 'kd' trees. The distance is computed using the L2
  (Euclidean) metric. Please see package 'RANN.L1' for the same
  functionality using the L1 (Manhattan, taxicab) metric.
