  Capture-Mark-Recapture Analysis using Multiple Non-Invasive
  Marks
maintainer: Brett T. McClintock
description: |-
  Traditional and spatial capture-mark-recapture analysis with
  multiple non-invasive marks. The models implemented in 'multimark' combine
  encounter history data arising from two different non-invasive ``marks'',
  such as images of left-sided and right-sided pelage patterns of bilaterally
  asymmetrical species, to estimate abundance and related demographic
  parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. Bayesian models are
  specified using simple formulae and fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo.
  Addressing deficiencies in currently available software, 'multimark' also
  provides a user-friendly interface for performing Bayesian multimodel
  inference using non-spatial or spatial capture-recapture data consisting of a single
  conventional mark or multiple non-invasive marks.
