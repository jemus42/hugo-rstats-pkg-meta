version: '0.4'
title: Download Files over HTTP and HTTPS
maintainer: Winston Chang
description: |-
  Provides a wrapper for the download.file function,
  making it possible to download files over HTTPS on Windows, Mac OS X, and
  other Unix-like platforms. The 'RCurl' package provides this functionality
  (and much more) but can be difficult to install because it must be compiled
  with external dependencies. This package has no external dependencies, so
  it is much easier to install.
