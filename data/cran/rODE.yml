  Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solvers Written in R Using
  S4 Classes
maintainer: Alfonso R. Reyes
description: |-
  Show physics, math and engineering students how an ODE solver
  is made and how effective R classes can be for the construction of
  the equations that describe natural phenomena. Inspiration for this work
  comes from the book on "Computer Simulations in Physics"
  by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian.
