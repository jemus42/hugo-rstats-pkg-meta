title: Panel Vector Autoregression
maintainer: Robert Ferstl
description: |-
  We extend two general methods of moment estimators to panel vector
  autoregression models (PVAR) with p lags of endogenous variables, predetermined
  and strictly exogenous variables. This general PVAR model contains the first
  difference GMM estimator by Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) <doi:10.2307/1913103>,
  Arellano and Bond (1991) <doi:10.2307/2297968> and the system GMM estimator
  by Blundell and Bond (1998) <doi:10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8>. We also
  provide specification tests (Hansen overidentification test, lag selection
  criterion and stability test of the PVAR polynomial) and classical structural
  analysis for PVAR models such as orthogonal and generalized impulse response
  functions, bootstrapped confidence intervals for impulse response analysis and
  forecast error variance decompositions.
