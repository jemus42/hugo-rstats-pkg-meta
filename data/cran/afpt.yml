title: Tools for Modelling of Animal Flight Performance
maintainer: Marco KleinHeerenbrink
description: |-
  Allows estimation and modelling of flight costs in animal (vertebrate) flight,
  implementing the aerodynamic power model described in Klein Heerenbrink et al.
  (2015) <doi:10.1098/rspa.2014.0952>. Taking inspiration from the program
  'Flight', developed by Colin Pennycuick (Pennycuick (2008) "Modelling the flying
  bird". Amsterdam: Elsevier. ISBN 0-19-857721-4), flight performance is estimated
  based on basic morphological measurements such as body mass, wingspan and wing
  area. 'afpt' can be used to make predictions on how animals should adjust their
  flight behaviour and wingbeat kinematics to varying flight conditions.
