title: Detecting Simpson's Paradox
maintainer: Rogier Kievit
description: |-
  This package detects instances of Simpson's Paradox in
  datasets. It examines subpopulations in the data, either
  user-defined or by means of cluster analysis, to test whether a
  regression at the level of the group is in the opposite
  direction at the level of subpopulations.
