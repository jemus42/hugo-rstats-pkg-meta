title: Fit the Gambin Model to Species Abundance Distributions
maintainer: Thomas Matthews
description: |-
  Fits unimodal and multimodal gambin distributions to species-abundance distributions
  from ecological data, as in in Matthews et al. (2014) <DOI:10.1111/ecog.00861>.
  'gambin' is short for 'gamma-binomial'. The main function is fit_abundances(), which estimates
  the 'alpha' parameter(s) of the gambin distribution using maximum likelihood. Functions are
  also provided to generate the gambin distribution and for calculating likelihood statistics.
