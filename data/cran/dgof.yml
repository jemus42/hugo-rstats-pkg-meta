version: '1.2'
title: Discrete Goodness-of-Fit Tests
maintainer: Taylor B. Arnold
description: This package contains a proposed revision to the<U+000a>stats::ks.test()
  function and the associated ks.test.Rd help<U+000a>page.  With one minor exception,
  it does not change the<U+000a>existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features
  necessary<U+000a>for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete<U+000a>distributions.  The
  package also contains cvm.test(), for doing<U+000a>one-sample Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit
  tests.
