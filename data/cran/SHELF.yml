title: Tools to Support the Sheffield Elicitation Framework
maintainer: Jeremy Oakley
description: |-
  Implements various methods for eliciting a probability distribution
  for a single parameter from an expert or a group of experts. The expert
  provides a small number of probability judgements, corresponding
  to points on his or her cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric
  distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
  form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. For multiple experts, a weighted
  linear pool can be calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs
  about population distributions, eliciting multivariate distributions using a
  Gaussian copula, eliciting a Dirichlet distribution, and eliciting distributions
  for variance parameters in a random effects meta-analysis model. R Shiny apps
  for most of the methods are included.
