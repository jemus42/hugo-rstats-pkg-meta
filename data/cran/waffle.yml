title: Create Waffle Chart Visualizations in R
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  Square pie charts (a.k.a. waffle charts) can be used
  to communicate parts of a whole for categorical quantities. To emulate the
  percentage view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square
  representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle charts do not
  necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a grid of any
  rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories
  small, just as should be done when creating pie charts. Tools are provided
  to create waffle charts as well as stitch them together, and to use glyphs
  for making isotype pictograms.
