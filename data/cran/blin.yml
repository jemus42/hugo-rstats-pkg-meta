title: Bipartite Longitudinal Influence Network (BLIN) Estimation
maintainer: Frank W. Marrs
description: Estimate influence networks from longitudinal bipartite relational data,
  where the longitudinal relations are continuous. The outputs are estimates of weighted
  influence networks among each actor type in the data set. The generative model is
  the Bipartite Longitudinal Influence Network (BLIN) model, a linear autoregressive
  model for these type of data. The supporting paper is ``Inferring Influence Networks
  from Longitudinal Bipartite Relational Data'', which is in preparation by the same
  authors. The model may be estimated using maximum likelihood methods and Bayesian
  methods. For more detail on methods, see Marrs et. al. <arXiv:1809.03439>.
