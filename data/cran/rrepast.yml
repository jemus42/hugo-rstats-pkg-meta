title: Invoke 'Repast Simphony' Simulation Models
maintainer: Antonio Prestes Garcia
description: |-
  An R and Repast integration tool for running individual-based
  (IbM) simulation models developed using 'Repast Simphony' Agent-Based framework
  directly from R code supporting multicore execution. This package
  integrates 'Repast Simphony' models within R environment, making easier
  the tasks of running and analyzing model output data for
  automated parameter calibration and for carrying out uncertainty and
  sensitivity analysis using the power of R environment.
