title: Extract Text from Rich Text Format (RTF) Documents
maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
description: |-
  Wraps the 'unrtf' utility to extract text from RTF files. Supports
  document conversion to HTML, LaTeX or plain text. Output in HTML is recommended
  because 'unrtf' has limited support for converting between character encodings.
