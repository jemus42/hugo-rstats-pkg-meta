title: Depth-Dependent Binocular Visual Fields Simulation
maintainer: Ping Liu
description: Simulation and visualization depth-dependent integrated visual fields.
  Visual fields are measured monocularly at a single depth, yet real-life activities
  involve predominantly binocular vision at multiple depths. The package provides
  functions to simulate and visualize binocular visual field impairment in a depth-dependent
  fashion from monocular visual field results based on Ping Liu, Allison McKendrick,
  Anna Ma-Wyatt, Andrew Turpin (2019) <doi:10.1167/tvst.9.3.8>. At each location and
  depth plane, sensitivities are linearly interpolated from corresponding locations
  in monocular visual field and returned as the higher value of the two. Its utility
  is demonstrated by evaluating DD-IVF defects associated with 12 glaucomatous archetypes
  of 24-2 visual field pattern in the included 'shiny' apps.
