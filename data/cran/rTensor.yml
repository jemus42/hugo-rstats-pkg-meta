title: Tools for Tensor Analysis and Decomposition
maintainer: James Li
description: |-
  A set of tools for creation, manipulation, and modeling
  of tensors with arbitrary number of modes. A tensor in the context of data
  analysis is a multidimensional array. rTensor does this by providing a S4
  class 'Tensor' that wraps around the base 'array' class. rTensor
  provides common tensor operations as methods, including matrix unfolding,
  summing/averaging across modes, calculating the Frobenius norm, and taking
  the inner product between two tensors. Familiar array operations are
  overloaded, such as index subsetting via '[' and element-wise operations.
  rTensor also implements various tensor decomposition, including CP, GLRAM,
  MPCA, PVD, and Tucker. For tensors with 3 modes, rTensor also implements
  transpose, t-product, and t-SVD, as defined in Kilmer et al. (2013). Some
  auxiliary functions include the Khatri-Rao product, Kronecker product, and
  the Hamadard product for a list of matrices.
