title: Loading Google Adwords Data into R
maintainer: Johannes Burkhardt
description: |-
  Aims at loading Google Adwords data into R. Adwords is an online
  advertising service that enables advertisers to display advertising copy to web
  users (see <https://developers.google.com/adwords/> for more information).
  Therefore the package implements three main features. First, the package
  provides an authentication process for R with the Google Adwords API (see
  <https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/> for more information) via OAUTH2.
  Second, the package offers an interface to apply the Adwords query language in
  R and query the Adwords API with ad-hoc reports. Third, the received data are
  transformed into suitable data formats for further data processing and data
  analysis.
