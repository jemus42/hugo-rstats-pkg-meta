maintainer: Robin K. S. Hankin
description: |-
  Performs Bayesian calibration of computer models as per
  Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001.  The package includes routines to find the
  hyperparameters and parameters; see the help page for stage1() for a
  worked example using the toy dataset.  A tutorial is provided in the
  calex.Rnw vignette; and a suite of especially simple one dimensional
  examples appears in inst/doc/one.dim/.
