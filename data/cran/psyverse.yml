title: Decentralized Unequivocality in Psychological Science
maintainer: Gjalt-Jorn Peters
description: |-
  The constructs used to study the human psychology have
  many definitions and corresponding instructions for eliciting
  and coding qualitative data pertaining to constructs' content and
  for measuring the constructs. This plethora of definitions and
  instructions necessitates unequivocal reference to specific
  definitions and instructions in empirical and secondary research.
  This package implements a human- and machine-readable standard for
  specifying construct definitions and instructions for measurement
  and qualitative research based on 'YAML'. This standard facilitates
  systematic unequivocal reference to specific construct definitions
  and corresponding instructions in a decentralized manner (i.e.
  without requiring central curation; Peters (2020)
  <doi:10.31234/osf.io/xebhn>).
