title: Tools for Script Editing
maintainer: Michael W. Kearney
description: |-
  A collection of useful tools for programming and writing-scripts.
  Several functions are simple wrappers around base R functions that extend
  their functionality while also providing some convenient propertiesâ€“regular
  expression functions that automatically detect look-ahead and look-behind
  statements, a read-line function that suppresses incomplete-final-line
  warnings and automatically opens and closes connections, a version of
  substrings that starts from the end of strings, etc. Other functions are
  useful for checking whether packages are installed, omitting
  missing data, and showing in-use connections.
