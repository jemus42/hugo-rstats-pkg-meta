title: Learned Pattern Similarity and Representation for Time Series
maintainer: Mustafa Gokce Baydogan
description: |-
  Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS) for time series.
  Implements a novel approach to model the dependency structure
  in time series that generalizes the concept of autoregression to local
  auto-patterns. Generates a pattern-based representation of time series
  along with a similarity measure called Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS).
  Introduces a generalized autoregressive kernel.This package is based on the
  'randomForest' package by Andy Liaw.
