title: Admixture Graph Manipulation and Fitting
maintainer: Thomas Mailund
description: |-
  Implements tools for building and visualising admixture graphs
  and for extracting equations from them. These equations can be compared to f-
  statistics obtained from data to test the consistency of a graph against data --
  for example by comparing the sign of f_4-statistics with the signs predicted by
  the graph -- and graph parameters (edge lengths and admixture proportions) can
  be fitted to observed statistics.
