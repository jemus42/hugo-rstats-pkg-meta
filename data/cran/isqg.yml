description: |-
  Accomplish high performance simulations in quantitative genetics.
  The molecular genetic components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods.
  Mimic the meiosis recombination and de novo genetic variability by means a
  count-location process (Karlin & Liberman, 1978) <doi:10.1073/pnas.75.12.6332>.
  The core computational algorithm is implemented using 'Boost' dynamic bitsets
  (Schaling, 2014) [ISBN:978-1937434366]. A mix between low and high level interfaces
  provides great flexibility and allows user defined extensions and a wide range of
  applications.
