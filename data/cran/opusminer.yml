title: OPUS Miner Algorithm for Filtered Top-k Association Discovery
maintainer: Christoph Bergmeir
description: Provides a simple R interface to the OPUS Miner algorithm (implemented
  in C++) for finding the top-k productive, non-redundant itemsets from transaction
  data.  The OPUS Miner algorithm uses the OPUS search algorithm to efficiently discover
  the key associations in transaction data, in the form of self-sufficient itemsets,
  using either leverage or lift.  See <http://i.giwebb.com/index.php/research/association-discovery/>
  for more information in relation to the OPUS Miner algorithm.
