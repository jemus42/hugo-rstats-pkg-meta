title: Classification Trees with Imprecise Probabilities
maintainer: Paul Fink
description: |-
  Creation of imprecise classification trees. They rely on
  probability estimation within each node by means of either the
  imprecise Dirichlet model or the nonparametric predictive
  inference approach. The splitting variable is selected by the
  strategy presented in Fink and Crossman (2013)
  <http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>,
  but also the original imprecise information gain of Abellan and
  Moral (2003) <doi:10.1002/int.10143> is covered.
