title: Combining Different Spatial Datasets in Cancer Risk Estimation
maintainer: Ming Wang
description: |-
  We propose a novel two-step procedure to combine epidemiological
  data obtained from diverse sources with the aim to quantify risk factors
  affecting the probability that an individual develops certain disease such as
  cancer. See  Hui Huang, Xiaomei Ma, Rasmus Waagepetersen, Theodore R. Holford,

  Association, 109:505, 11-23,  <doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.870904>.
