description: Implements the three-step procedure proposed by Leffondree et al. (2004)
  to identify clusters of individual longitudinal trajectories. The procedure involves
  (1) calculating 24 measures describing the features of the trajectories; (2) using
  factor analysis to select a subset of the 24 measures and (3) using cluster analysis
  to identify clusters of trajectories, and classify each individual trajectory in
  one of the clusters.
