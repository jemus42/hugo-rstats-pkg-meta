title: Kaya Identity Data for Nations and Regions
maintainer: Jonathan Gilligan
description: |-
  Provides data for Kaya identity variables (population, gross
  domestic product, primary energy consumption, and energy-related
  CO2 emissions) for the world and for individual nations, and
  utility functions for looking up data,  plotting trends of
  Kaya variables, and plotting the fuel mix for a given country
  or region. The Kaya identity (Yoichi Kaya and Keiichi Yokobori,
  "Environment, Energy, and Economy: Strategies for Sustainability"
  (United Nations University Press, 1998) and
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity>) expresses a nation's
  or region's greenhouse gas emissions in terms of its population,
  per-capita Gross Domestic Product, the energy intensity of its
  economy, and the carbon-intensity of its energy supply.
