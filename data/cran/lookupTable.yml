title: Look-Up Tables using S4
maintainer: Enzo Jia
description: |-
  Fits look-up tables by filling entries with the mean or median values of observations
  fall in partitions of the feature space. Partitions can be determined by user of the
  package using input argument feature.boundaries, and dimensions of the feature space
  can be any combination of continuous and categorical features provided by the data set.
  A Predict function directly fetches corresponding entry value, and a default value is
  defined as the mean or median of all available observations.
  The table and other components are represented using the S4 class lookupTable.
