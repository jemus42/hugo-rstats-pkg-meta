  Proximal/Distal Modeling Framework for Pavlovian Conditioning
  Phenomena
maintainer: Chloe Bracis
description: Fits a model of Pavlovian conditioning phenomena, such as response extinction
  and spontaneous recovery, and partial reinforcement extinction effects. Competing
  proximal and distal reward predictions, computed using fast and slow learning rates,
  combine according to their uncertainties and the recency of information. The resulting
  mean prediction drives the response rate.
