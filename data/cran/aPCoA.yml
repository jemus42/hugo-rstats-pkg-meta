title: Covariate Adjusted PCoA Plot
maintainer: Yushu Shi
description: In fields such as ecology, microbiology, and genomics, non-Euclidean
  distances are widely applied to describe pairwise dissimilarity between samples.
  Given these pairwise distances, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) is commonly
  used to construct a visualization of the data. However, confounding covariates can
  make patterns related to the scientific question of interest difficult to observe.
  We provide 'aPCoA' as an easy-to-use tool to improve data visualization in this
  context, enabling enhanced presentation of the effects of interest. Details are
  described in Yushu Shi, Liangliang Zhang, Kim-Anh Do, Christine Peterson and Robert
  Jenq (2020) <arXiv:2003.09544>.
