  Similarity and Distance Quantification Between Probability
  Functions
maintainer: Hajk-Georg Drost
description: Computes 46 optimized distance and similarity measures for comparing
  probability functions (Drost (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00765>). These comparisons
  between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific
  disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a
  core framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit,
  non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are
  based on comparing univariate or multivariate probability functions.
