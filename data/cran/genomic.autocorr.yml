title: Models Dealing with Spatial Dependency in Genomic Data
maintainer: Chris Wallace
description: Local structure in genomic data often induces dependence between observations
  taken at different genomic locations.  Ignoring this dependence leads to underestimation
  of the standard error of parameter estimates.  This package uses block bootstrapping
  to estimate asymptotically correct standard errors of parameters from any standard
  generalised linear model that may be fit by the glm() function.
