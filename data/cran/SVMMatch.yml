  Causal Effect Estimation and Diagnostics with Support Vector
  Machines
maintainer: Marc Ratkovic
description: Causal effect estimation in observational data often requires identifying
  a set of untreated observations that are comparable to some treated group of interest.  This
  package provides a suite of functions for identifying such a set of observations
  and for implementing standard and new diagnostics tools.  The primary function,
  svmmatch(), uses support vector machines to identify a region of common support
  between treatment and control groups.  A sensitivity analysis, balance checking,
  and assessment of the region of overlap between treated and control groups is included.  The
  Bayesian implementation allows for recovery of uncertainty estimates for the treatment
  effect and all other parameters.
