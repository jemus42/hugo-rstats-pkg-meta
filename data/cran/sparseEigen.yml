title: Computation of Sparse Eigenvectors of a Matrix
maintainer: Daniel P. Palomar
description: |-
  Computation of sparse eigenvectors of a matrix (aka sparse PCA)
  with running time 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than existing methods and
  better final performance in terms of recovery of sparsity pattern and
  estimation of numerical values. Can handle covariance matrices as well as
  data matrices with real or complex-valued entries. Different levels of
  sparsity can be specified for each individual ordered eigenvector and the
  method is robust in parameter selection. See vignette for a detailed
  documentation and comparison, with several illustrative examples.
  The package is based on the paper:
  K. Benidis, Y. Sun, P. Babu, and D. P. Palomar (2016). "Orthogonal Sparse PCA
  and Covariance Estimation via Procrustes Reformulation," IEEE Transactions on
  Signal Processing <doi:10.1109/TSP.2016.2605073>.
