title: Create Interactive Chart with the JavaScript 'Billboard' Library
maintainer: Victor Perrier
description: |-
  Provides an 'htmlwidgets' interface to 'billboard.js',
  a re-usable easy interface JavaScript chart library, based on D3 v4+.
  Chart types include line charts, scatterplots, bar/lollipop charts, histogram/density plots, pie/donut charts and gauge charts.
  All charts are interactive, and a proxy method is implemented to smoothly update a chart without rendering it again in 'shiny' apps.
