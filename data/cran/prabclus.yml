  Abundance and Multilocus Genetic Data
maintainer: Christian Hennig
description: |-
  Distance-based parametric bootstrap tests for clustering with
  spatial neighborhood information. Some distance measures,
  Clustering of presence-absence, abundance and multilocus genetic data
  for species delimitation, nearest neighbor
  based noise detection. Genetic distances between communities.
  Tests whether various distance-based regressions
  are equal. Try package?prabclus for on overview.
