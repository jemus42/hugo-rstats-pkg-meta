title: Estimation of the Number of Fatalities from Carcass Searches
maintainer: Fraenzi Korner-Nievergelt
description: The number of bird or bat fatalities from collisions with buildings,
  towers or wind energy turbines can be estimated based on carcass searches and experimentally
  assessed carcass persistence times and searcher efficiency. Functions for estimating
  the probability that a bird or bat that died is found by a searcher are provided.
  Further functions calculate the posterior distribution of the number of fatalities
  based on the number of carcasses found and the estimated detection probability.
