title: Regression-Based Approach for Testing the Type of Missing Data
maintainer: Serguei Rouzinov
description: |-
  The regression-based (RB) approach is a method to test the missing data mechanism.
  This package contains two functions that test the type of missing data (Missing Completely
  At Random vs Missing At Random) on the basis of the RB approach. The first function applies
  the RB approach independently on each variable with missing data, using the completely
  observed variables only. The second function tests the missing data mechanism globally
  (on all variables with missing data) with the use of all available information. The
  algorithm is adapted both to continuous and categorical data.
