  Generate Fully-Sequential Space-Filling Designs Inside a Unit
  Hypercube

description: Provides three methods proposed by Shang and Apley (2019) <doi:10.1080/00224065.2019.1705207>
  to generate fully-sequential space-filling designs inside a unit hypercube. A 'fully-sequential
  space-filling design' means a sequence of nested designs (as the design size varies
  from one point up to some maximum number of points) with the design points added
  one at a time and such that the design at each size has good space-filling properties.
  Two methods target the minimum pairwise distance criterion and generate maximin
  designs, among which one method is more efficient when design size is large. One
  method targets the maximum hole size criterion and uses a heuristic to generate
  what is closer to a minimax design.
