title: Probabilistic Species Co-Occurrence Analysis in R
maintainer: Daniel M. Griffith
description: This R package applies the probabilistic model of species co-occurrence
  (Veech 2013) to a set of species distributed among a set of survey or sampling sites.
  The algorithm calculates the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence
  between each pair of species. The expected frequency is based on the distribution
  of each species being random and independent of the other species. The analysis
  returns the probabilities that a more extreme (either low or high) value of co-occurrence
  could have been obtained by chance. The package also includes functions for visualizing
  species co-occurrence results and preparing data for downstream analyses.
