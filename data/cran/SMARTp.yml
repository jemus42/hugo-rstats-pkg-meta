title: Sample Size for SMART Designs in Non-Surgical Periodontal Trials
maintainer: Dipankar Bandyopadhyay
description: Sample size calculation to detect dynamic treatment regime (DTR) effects
  based on change in clinical attachment level (CAL) outcomes from a non-surgical
  chronic periodontitis treatments study. The experiment is performed under a Sequential
  Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. The clustered tooth (sub-unit)
  level CAL outcomes are skewed, spatially-referenced, and non-randomly missing. The
  implemented algorithm is available in Xu et al. (2019+) <arXiv:1902.09386>.
