title: Interactive Exploration of Contour Data
maintainer: Bryan A. Hanson
description: |-
  Interactive tools to explore topographic-like data
  sets.  Such data sets take the form of a matrix in which the rows and
  columns provide location/frequency information, and the matrix elements
  contain altitude/response information.  Such data is found in cartography,
  2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The functions in this package create
  interactive web pages showing the contoured data, possibly with
  slices from the original matrix parallel to each dimension. The interactive
  behavior is created using the 'D3.js' 'JavaScript' library by Mike Bostock.
