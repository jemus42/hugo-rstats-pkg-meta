title: Generate a Survey that can be Completed by Survey Respondents
maintainer: Char Leung
description: |-
  Help generate slides for surveys or experiments.
  The resulted slides allow the subject to respond with the use of the mouse (usual keyboard input is
  replaced with clicking on a virtual keyboard on the slide). Subjects' responses are saved to the user-
  specified location in the form of R-readable text file. To allow flexibility, each function in
  this package generates a particular type of slides thus general R function writing skills are
  required to compile these edited slides.
