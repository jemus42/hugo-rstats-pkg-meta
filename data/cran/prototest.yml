title: Inference on Prototypes from Clusters of Features
maintainer: Stephen Reid
description: Procedures for testing for group-wide signal in clusters of variables.
  Tests can be performed for single groups in isolation (univariate) or multiple groups
  together (multivariate). Specific tests include the exact and approximate (un)selective
  likelihood ratio tests described in Reid et al (2015), the selective F test and
  marginal screening prototype test of Reid and Tibshirani (2015). User may pre-specify
  columns to be included in prototype formation, or allow the function to select them
  itself. A mixture of these two is also possible. Any variable selection is accounted
  for using the selective inference framework. Options for non-sampling and hit-and-run
  null reference distributions.
