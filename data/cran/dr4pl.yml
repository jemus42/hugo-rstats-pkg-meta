  Dose Response Data Analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic (4pl)
  Model
maintainer: Justin T. Landis
description: Models the relationship between dose levels and responses in a pharmacological
  experiment using the 4 Parameter Logistic model. Traditional packages on dose-response
  modelling such as 'drc' and 'nplr' often draw errors due to convergence failure
  especially when data have outliers or non-logistic shapes. This package provides
  robust estimation methods that are less affected by outliers and other initialization
  methods that work well for data lacking logistic shapes. We provide the bounds on
  the parameters of the 4PL model that prevent parameter estimates from diverging
  or converging to zero and base their justification in a statistical principle. These
  methods are used as remedies to convergence failure problems.  Gadagkar, S. R. and
