version: 0.4.5
title: Mesh Generation and Surface Tessellation
maintainer: David C. Sterratt
description: |-
  Makes the 'Qhull' library <http://www.qhull.org>
  available in R, in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull
  computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
  intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
  Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
  runs in 2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions. It implements the
  Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does not
  support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of
  non-convex objects, but the package does include some R functions
  that allow for this.
