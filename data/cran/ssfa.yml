description: 'Spatial Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SSFA) is an original method for
  controlling the spatial heterogeneity in Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) models,
  for cross-sectional data, by splitting the inefficiency term into three terms: the
  first one related to spatial peculiarities of the territory in which each single
  unit operates, the second one related to the specific production features and the
  third one representing the error term.'
