  Estimation of the Generalized Symmetry Point, an Optimal
  Cutpoint in Continuous Diagnostic Tests
maintainer: Mónica López-Ratón
description: Estimation of the cutpoint defined by the Generalized Symmetry point
  in a binary classification setting based on a continuous diagnostic test or marker.
  Two methods have been implemented to construct confidence intervals for this optimal
  cutpoint, one based on the Generalized Pivotal Quantity and the other based on Empirical
  Likelihood. Numerical and graphical outputs for these two methods are easily obtained.
