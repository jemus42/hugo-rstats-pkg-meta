  Tools and Tests for Experiments with Partially Synthetic Data
  Sets
maintainer: Charlotte Looby
description: A set of functions to support experimentation in the utility of partially
  synthetic data sets.  All functions compare an observed data set to one or a set
  of partially synthetic data sets derived from the observed data to (1) check that
  data sets have identical attributes, (2) calculate overall and specific variable
  perturbation rates, (3) check for potential logical inconsistencies, and (4) calculate
  confidence intervals and standard errors of desired variables in multiple imputed
  data sets. Confidence interval and standard error formulas have options for either
  synthetic data sets or multiple imputed data sets. For more information on the formulas
  and methods used, see Reiter & Raghunathan (2007) <doi:10.1198/016214507000000932>.
