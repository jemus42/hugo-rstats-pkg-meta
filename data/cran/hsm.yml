title: A Path-Based BCD for Proximal Function of Latent Group Lasso
maintainer: Xiaohan Yan
description: |-
  Implementation of the block coordinate descent procedure for
  solving the proximal function of latent group Lasso, highlighted by
  decomposing a DAG into several non-overlapping path graphs, and getting
  closed-form solution for each path graph. The procedure was introduced
  as Algorithm 4 in Yan and Bien (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-STS622>
  "Hierarchical Sparse Modeling: A Choice of Two Group Lasso Formulations", and the
  closed-form solution for each path graph is solved in Algorithm 3 of
  that paper.
