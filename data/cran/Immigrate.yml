  Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction
  Terms for Feature Selection
maintainer: Ruzhang Zhao<ruzhangzhao@gmail.com>
description: 'Based on large margin principle, this package performs feature selection
  methods: "IM4E"(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm);
  "Immigrate"(Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms
  Algorithm); "BIM"(Boosted version of IMMIGRATE algorithm); "Simba"(Iterative Search
  Margin Based Algorithm); "LFE"(Local Feature Extraction Algorithm). This package
  also performs prediction for the above feature selection methods.'
