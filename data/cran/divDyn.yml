title: Diversity Dynamics using Fossil Sampling Data
maintainer: Adam T. Kocsis
description: 'Functions to describe sampling and diversity dynamics of fossil occurrence
  datasets (e.g. from the Paleobiology Database). The package includes methods to
  calculate range- and occurrence-based metrics of taxonomic richness, extinction
  and origination rates, along with traditional sampling measures. A powerful subsampling
  tool is also included that implements frequently used sampling standardization methods
  in a multiple bin-framework. The plotting of time series and the occurrence data
  can be simplified by the functions incorporated in the package, as well other calculations,
  such as environmental affinities and extinction selectivity testing. Details can
  be found in: Kocsis, A.T.; Reddin, C.J.; Alroy, J. and Kiessling, W. (2019) <doi:10.1101/423780>.'
