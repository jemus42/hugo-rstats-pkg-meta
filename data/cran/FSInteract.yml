title: Fast Searches for Interactions
maintainer: Rajen D. Shah
description: |-
  Performs fast detection of interactions in large-scale data using the
  method of random intersection trees introduced in
  Shah, R. D. and Meinshausen, N. (2014) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/shah14a.html>.
  The algorithm finds potentially high-order interactions in high-dimensional binary
  two-class classification data, without requiring lower order interactions
  to be informative.  The search is particularly fast when the matrices of
  predictors are sparse.  It can also be used to perform market basket analysis
  when supplied with a single binary data matrix.  Here it will find collections
  of columns which for many rows contain all 1's.
