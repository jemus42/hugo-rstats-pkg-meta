title: Sequential Input Selection Algorithm
maintainer: Mikko Korpela
description: |-
  Implements the SISAL algorithm by Tikka and Hollm√©n. It is
  a sequential backward selection algorithm which uses a linear
  model in a cross-validation setting. Starting from the full
  model, one variable at a time is removed based on the
  regression coefficients. From this set of models, a
  parsimonious (sparse) model is found by choosing the model with
  the smallest number of variables among those models where the
  validation error is smaller than a threshold. Also implements
  extensions which explore larger parts of the search space
  and/or use ridge regression instead of ordinary least squares.
