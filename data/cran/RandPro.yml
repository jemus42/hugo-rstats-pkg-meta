title: Random Projection with Classification
maintainer: Siddharth R
description: Performs random projection using Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma (see
  William B.Johnson and Joram Lindenstrauss (1984) <doi:10.1090/conm/026/737400>).
  Random Projection is a dimension reduction technique, where the data in the high
  dimensional space is projected into the low dimensional space using JL transform.
  The original high dimensional data matrix is multiplied with the low dimensional
  projection matrix which results in reduced matrix. The projection matrix can be
  generated using the projection function that is independent to the original data.
  Then finally apply the classification task on the projected data.
