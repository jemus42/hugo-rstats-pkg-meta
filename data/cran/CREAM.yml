title: Clustering of Genomic Regions Analysis Method
maintainer: Benjamin Haibe-Kains
description: |-
  Provides a new method for identification of clusters of genomic
  regions within chromosomes. Primarily, it is used for calling clusters of
  cis-regulatory elements (COREs). 'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions
  in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as those generated from chromatin-based
  assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements
  within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the following steps:
  1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance between the elements
  within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be clustered
  as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which
  does not pass the threshold considered in the approach.
