title: Graphical and Numerical Checks for Mode-Finding Routines
maintainer: Martin Lysy
description: Tools for checking that the output of an optimization algorithm is indeed
  at a local mode of the objective function.  This is accomplished graphically by
  calculating all one-dimensional "projection plots" of the objective function, i.e.,
  varying each input variable one at a time with all other elements of the potential
  solution being fixed.  The numerical values in these plots can be readily extracted
  for the purpose of automated and systematic unit-testing of optimization routines.
