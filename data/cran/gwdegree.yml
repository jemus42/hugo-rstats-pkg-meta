  A Shiny App to Aid Interpretation of Geometrically-Weighted
  Degree Estimates in Exponential Random Graph Models
maintainer: Michael Levy
description: This is a Shiny application intended to provide better understanding
  of how geometrically-weighted degree terms function in exponential random graph
  models of networks. It contains just one user function, gwdegree(), which launches
  the Shiny application.
