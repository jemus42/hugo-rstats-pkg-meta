title: Zero Inflated Poisson Factor Analysis
maintainer: Tianchen Xu
description: |-
  Estimation methods for zero-inflated Poisson factor analysis (ZIPFA) on sparse data.
  It provides estimates of coefficients in a new type of zero-inflated regression.
  It provides a cross-validation method to determine the potential rank of the data in the ZIPFA
  and conducts zero-inflated Poisson factor analysis based on the determined rank.
