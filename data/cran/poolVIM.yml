  Gene-Based Association Tests using the Actual Impurity Reduction
  (AIR) Variable Importance
maintainer: Stefano Nembrini
description: Gene-based association tests using the actual impurity reduction (AIR)
  variable importance. The function aggregates AIR importance measures from a group
  of SNPs or probes and outputs a p-value for each gene. The procedures builds upon
  the method described in <doi:10.1093/Bioinformatics/Bty373> and will be published
  soon.
