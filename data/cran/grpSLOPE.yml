description: |-
  Group SLOPE is a penalized linear regression method that is used
  for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a
  high-dimensional linear model.
  The Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false discovery rate at a
  user-specified level (i.e., control the expected proportion of irrelevant
  among all selected groups of predictors).
