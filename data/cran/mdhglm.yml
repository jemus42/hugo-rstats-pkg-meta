title: Multivariate Double Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Maengseok Noh
description: Allows various models for multivariate response variables where each
  response is assumed to follow double hierarchical generalized linear models. In
  double hierarchical generalized linear models, the mean, dispersion parameters for
  variance of random effects, and residual variance can be further modeled as random-effect
  models.
