  New Plots Based on 'ggplot2' and Functions to Create Regular
  Shapes
maintainer: Jiang Wu
description: |-
  An extension to 'ggplot2' and 'magick'. It contains
  three groups of functions: Functions in the first group draw 'ggplot2' - based plots: geom_shading_bar() draws barplot
  with shading colors in each bar. geom_rect_cm(), geom_circle_cm() and geom_ellipse_cm() draw rectangles, circles
  and ellipses with centimeter as their unit. Thus their sizes do not change when the coordinate system or the aspect ratio
  changes. annotation_transparent_text() draws labels with transparent texts. annotation_shading_polygon() draws irregular
  polygons with shading colors. Functions in the second group generate coordinates for regular shapes and make linear transformations. Functions in the third group are 'magick' - based functions facilitating image processing.
