title: Clustering by Fast Search and Find of Density Peaks
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the
  density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez
  and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344). It can handle large datasets
  (> 100, 000 samples) very efficiently. It was initially implemented by
  Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs from Sean Hughes and later improved by
  Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets with kNNs.
