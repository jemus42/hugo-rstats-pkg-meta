title: Expectation-Maximization Binary Clustering
maintainer: Joan Garriga
description: Unsupervised, multivariate, binary clustering for meaningful annotation
  of data, taking into account the uncertainty in the data. A specific constructor
  for trajectory analysis in movement ecology yields behavioural annotation of trajectories
  based on estimated local measures of velocity and turning angle, eventually with
  solar position covariate as a daytime indicator, ("Expectation-Maximization Binary
  Clustering for Behavioural Annotation").
