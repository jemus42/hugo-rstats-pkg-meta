title: Copula-Based Regression Models for Bivariate Censored Data
maintainer: Tao Sun
description: |-
  Copula-based regression models for bivariate censored data, including
  bivariate right-censored data and bivariate interval-censored data. Currently
  supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH and Copula2 copula models. For
  marginal models, it supports parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, Gompertz) and
  semiparametric (Cox and transformation) models. Includes methods for convenient
  prediction and plotting. Also provides a bivariate time-to-event simulation function.
  Method details can be found in Sun et.al. (2018) < doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09459-5>
  and Sun et.al (2019) <arXiv:1901.01918>.
