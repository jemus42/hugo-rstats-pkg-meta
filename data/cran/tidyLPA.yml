  Easily Carry Out Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) Using Open-Source
  or Commercial Software
maintainer: Joshua M Rosenberg
description: |-
  An interface to the 'mclust' package to easily
  carry out latent profile analysis ("LPA"). Provides functionality to
  estimate commonly-specified models. Follows a tidy approach, in that
  output is in the form of a data frame that can subsequently be
  computed on. Also has functions to interface to the commercial 'MPlus'
  software via the 'MplusAutomation' package.
