  Measures of Risk for the Compound Poisson Risk Process with
  Diffusion
maintainer: Benjamin Baumgartner
description: |-
  Based on the compound Poisson risk process that is perturbed by
  a Brownian motion, saddlepoint approximations to some measures of risk are
  provided. Various approximation methods for the probability of ruin are
  also included. Furthermore, exact values of both the risk measures as well
  as the probability of ruin are available if the individual claims follow
  a hypo-exponential distribution (i. e., if it can be represented as a sum
  of independent exponentially distributed random variables with different
  rate parameters). For more details see Gatto and Baumgartner (2014)
