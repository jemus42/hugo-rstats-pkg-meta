  Single to Double Arm Transition Design for Phase II Clinical
  Trials
maintainer: Haolun Shi
description: The package is used for calibrating the design parameters for single-to-double
  arm transition design proposed by Shi and Yin (2017). The calibration is performed
  via numerical enumeration to find the optimal design that satisfies the constraints
  on the type I and II error rates.
