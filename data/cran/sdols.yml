title: Summarizing Distributions of Latent Structures
maintainer: David B. Dahl
description: Summaries of distributions on clusterings and feature allocations are
  provided. Specifically, point estimates are obtained by the sequentially-allocated
  latent structure optimization (SALSO) algorithm to minimize squared error loss,
  absolute error loss, Binder loss, or the lower bound of the variation of information
  loss. Clustering uncertainty can be assessed with the confidence calculations and
  the associated plot.
