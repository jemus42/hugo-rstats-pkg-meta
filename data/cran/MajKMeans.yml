title: k-Means Algorithm with a Majorization-Minimization Method
maintainer: Sheikhi Ayyub
description: 'A hybrid of the K-means algorithm and a Majorization-Minimization method
  to introduce a robust clustering. The reference paper is: Julien Mairal, (2015)
  <doi:10.1137/140957639>. The two most important functions in package ''MajKMeans''
  are cluster_km() and cluster_MajKm(). cluster_km() clusters data without Majorization-Minimization
  and cluster_MajKm() clusters data with Majorization-Minimization method. Both of
  these functions calculate the sum of squares (SS) of clustering.'
