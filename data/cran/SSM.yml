title: Fit and Analyze Smooth Supersaturated Models
maintainer: Peter Curtis
description: |-
  Creates an S4 class "SSM" and defines functions for fitting smooth
  supersaturated models, a polynomial model with spline-like behaviour.
  Functions are defined for the computation of Sobol indices for sensitivity
  analysis and plotting the main effects using FANOVA methods. It also
  implements the estimation of the SSM metamodel error using a GP model with
  a variety of defined correlation functions.
