  Estimating Conditional Auto-Regressive (CAR) Models using Monte
  Carlo Likelihood Methods
maintainer: Zhe Sha
description: The likelihood of direct CAR models and Binomial and Poisson GLM with
  latent CAR variables are approximated by the Monte Carlo likelihood. The Maximum
  Monte Carlo likelihood estimator is found either by an iterative procedure of directly
  maximising the Monte Carlo approximation or by a response surface design method.Reference
  for the method can be found in the DPhil thesis in Z. Sha (2016). For application
  a good reference is R.Bivand et.al (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.002>.
