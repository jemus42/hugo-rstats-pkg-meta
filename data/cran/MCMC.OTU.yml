  Bayesian Analysis of Multivariate Counts Data in DNA
  Metabarcoding and Ecology
maintainer: Mikhail V. Matz
description: 'Poisson-lognormal generalized linear mixed model analysis of multivariate
  counts data using MCMC, aiming to infer the changes in relative proportions of individual
  variables. The package was originally designed for sequence-based analysis of microbial
  communities ("metabarcoding", variables = operational taxonomic units, OTUs), but
  can be used for other types of multivariate counts, such as in ecological applications
  (variables = species). The results are summarized and plotted using ''ggplot2''
  functions. Includes functions to remove sample and variable outliers and reformat
  counts into normalized log-transformed values for correlation and principal component/coordinate
  analysis. Walkthrough and examples: http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/matz_lab/matzlab/Methods_files/walkthroughExample_mcmcOTU_R.txt.'
