title: Generating and Testing DNA Sequences
maintainer: Hasinur Rahaman Khan
description: Generates DNA sequences based on Markov model techniques for matched
  sequences. This can be generalized to several sequences. The sequences (taxa) are
  then arranged in an evolutionary tree (phylogenetic tree) depicting how taxa diverge
  from their common ancestors. This gives the tests and estimation methods for the
  parameters of different models. Standard phylogenetic methods assume stationarity,
  homogeneity and reversibility for the Markov processes, and  often impose further
  restrictions on the parameters.
