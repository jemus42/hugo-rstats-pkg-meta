title: Determine Position of Observer
maintainer: Mathias Milfeldt
description: |-
  Measuring angles between points in a landscape is much easier
  than measuring distances. When the location of three points is known the
  position of the observer can be determined based solely on the angles between
  these points as seen by the observer. This task (known as triangulation)
  however requires onerous calculations - these calculations are automated by this
  package.
