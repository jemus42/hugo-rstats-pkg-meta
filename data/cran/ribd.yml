title: Pedigree-based Relatedness Coefficients
maintainer: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
description: |-
  Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients,
  including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both autosomal
  and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are allowed to be inbred.
  In addition to the standard pairwise coefficients, ribd also computes a range
  of lesser-known coefficients, including generalised kinship coefficients
  (Karigl (1981) <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x>; Weeks and
  Lange (1988) <https:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715269>),
  two-locus coefficients (Thompson (1988) <doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261>) and
  multi-person coefficients. This package is part of the ped suite,
  a collection of packages for pedigree analysis with 'pedtools' as the core
  package for creating and handling pedigree objects.
