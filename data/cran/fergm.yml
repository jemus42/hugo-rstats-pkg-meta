description: |-
  Frailty Exponential Random Graph Models estimated through pseudo likelihood with frailty terms estimated using 'Stan' as per Box-Steffensmeier et. al (2017) <doi:10.7910/DVN/K3D1M2>.
  Goodness of fit for Frailty Exponential Random Graph Models is also available, with easy visualizations for comparison to fit Exponential Random Graph Models.
