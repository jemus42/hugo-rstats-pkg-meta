  Data Management Tools for Real-Time Monitoring/Ecological
  Momentary Assessment Data
maintainer: Evan Kleiman
description: 'Do data management functions common in real-time monitoring (also called:
  ecological momentary assessment, experience sampling, micro-longitudinal) data,
  including creating power curves for multilevel data, centering on participant means
  and merging event-level data into momentary data sets where you need the events
  to correspond to the nearest data point in the momentary data. This is VERY early
  release software, and more features will be added over time.'
