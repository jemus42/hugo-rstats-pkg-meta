title: Clustering Mutations using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Data
maintainer: Paul Deveau
description: |-
  Using HTS data, clusters mutations in order to recreate putative
  clones from the data provided. It requires genotype at the location of the
  variant as well as the depth of coverage and number of reads supporting the
  mutation. Additional information may be provided, such as the contamination
  in the tumor sample. This package also provides a function QuantumCat() which
  simulates data obtained from tumor sequencing.
