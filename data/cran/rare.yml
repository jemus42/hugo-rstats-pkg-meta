  Linear Model with Tree-Based Lasso Regularization for Rare
  Features
maintainer: Xiaohan Yan
description: |-
  Implementation of an alternating direction method of multipliers
  algorithm for fitting a linear model with tree-based lasso regularization,
  which is proposed in Algorithm 1 of Yan and Bien (2018) <arXiv:1803.06675>.
  The package allows efficient model fitting on the entire 2-dimensional
  regularization path for large datasets. The complete set of functions
  also makes the entire process of tuning regularization parameters and
  visualizing results hassle-free.
