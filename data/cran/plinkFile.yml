description: Provide function that reads binary genotype produced by 'PLINK' <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed>
  into a R matrix, or scan the genotype one variant at a time like apply(), it also
  provides functions that reads and writes genotype relatedness/kinship matrices created
  by 'PLINK' <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/distance#make_rel> or 'GCTA'
  <https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#MakingaGRM>. Currently it does not support
  writing back into 'PLINK' binary, it is best used for bringing data produced by
  'PLINK' and 'GCTA' into R environment.
