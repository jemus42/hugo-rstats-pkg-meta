version: 1.1.6
title: Conduct Simulation Studies with a Minimal Amount of Source Code
maintainer: Marsel Scheer
description: |-
  Tool for statistical simulations that have two components.
  One component generates the data and the other one
  analyzes the data. The main aims of the package are the reduction
  of the administrative source code (mainly loops and management code for the
  results) and a simple applicability of the package that allows the user to
  quickly learn how to work with it. Parallel computing is
  also supported. Finally, convenient functions are provided to summarize the
  simulation results.
