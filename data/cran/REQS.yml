version: 0.8-12
title: R/EQS Interface
maintainer: Eric Wu
description: |-
  This package contains the function run.eqs() which calls
  an EQS script file, executes the EQS estimation, and, finally,
  imports the results as R objects. These two steps can be
  performed separately: call.eqs() calls and executes EQS,
  whereas read.eqs() imports existing EQS outputs as objects into
  R. It requires EQS 6.2 (build 98 or higher).
