title: Statistical Methods for Normalizing Metabolomics Data
maintainer: Alysha M De Livera
description: Metabolomics data are inevitably subject to a component of unwanted variation,
  due to factors such as batch effects, matrix effects, and confounding biological
  variation. This package contains a collection of R functions which can be used to
  remove unwanted variation and obtain normalized metabolomics data.
