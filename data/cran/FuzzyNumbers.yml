  S4 classes and methods
  to deal with fuzzy numbers. They allow for computing any arithmetic
  operations (e.g., by using the Zadeh extension principle),
  performing approximation of arbitrary fuzzy numbers by trapezoidal
  and piecewise linear ones, preparing plots for publications, computing
  possibility and necessity values for comparisons, etc.
