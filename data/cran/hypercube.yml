title: Organizing Data in Hypercubes
maintainer: Michael Scholz
description: |-
  Provides functions and methods for organizing data in hypercubes
  (i.e., a multi-dimensional cube). Cubes are generated from molten data frames.
  Each cube can be manipulated with five operations: rotation (change.dimensionOrder()),
  dicing and slicing (add.selection(), remove.selection()), drilling down (add.aggregation()),
  and rolling up (remove.aggregation()).
