title: Targeted Stable Balancing Weights Using Optimization
maintainer: Noah Greifer
description: Use optimization to estimate weights that balance covariates for binary,
  multinomial, and continuous treatments in the spirit of Zubizarreta (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805>.
  The degree of balance can be specified for each covariate. In addition, sampling
  weights can be estimated that allow a sample to generalize to a population specified
  with given target moments of covariates.
