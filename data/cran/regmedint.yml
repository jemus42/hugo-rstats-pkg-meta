maintainer: Kazuki Yoshida
description: '''R'' re-implementation of the regression-based causal mediation analysis
  with a treatment-mediator interaction term, as originally implemented in the ''SAS''
  macro by Valeri and VanderWeele (2013) <doi:10.1037/a0031034> and Valeri and VanderWeele
  (2015) <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000253>. Linear and logistic models are supported
  for the mediator model. Linear, logistic, loglinear, Poisson, negative binomial,
  Cox, and accelerated failure time (exponential and Weibull) models are supported
  for the outcome model.'
