title: A Monte Carlo Based Heterogeneity Test for Meta-Analysis
maintainer: Ge Jiang
description: Implements a Monte Carlo Based Heterogeneity Test for standardized mean
  differences (d), Fisher-transformed Pearson's correlations (r), and natural-logarithm-transformed
  odds ratio (OR) in Meta-Analysis Studies. Depending on the presence of moderators,
  this Monte Carlo Based Test can be implemented in the random or mixed-effects model.
  This package uses rma() function from the R package 'metafor' to obtain parameter
  estimates and likelihood, so installation of R package 'metafor' is required.
