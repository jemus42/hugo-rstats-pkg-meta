title: Shadow-Test Approach to Computerized Adaptive Testing
maintainer: Bingnan Jiang
description: |-
  As an advanced approach to computerized adaptive testing (CAT),
  shadow testing (van der Linden(2005) <doi:10.1007/0-387-29054-0>) dynamically
  assembles entire shadow tests as a part of
  selecting items throughout the testing process.
  Selecting items from shadow tests guarantees the compliance of all content
  constraints defined by the blueprint. 'RSCAT' is an R package for the
  shadow-test approach to CAT. The objective of
  'RSCAT' is twofold: 1) Enhancing the effectiveness of shadow-test CAT simulation;
  2) Contributing to the academic and scientific community for CAT research.
