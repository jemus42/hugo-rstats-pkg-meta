title: Measuring Agreement Using Sklar's Omega Coefficient
maintainer: John Hughes
description: |-
  Provides tools for applying Sklar's Omega (Hughes, 2018) <arXiv:1803.02734>
  methodology to nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio scores. The framework can
  accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and missingness; and
  can be used to measure agreement with a gold standard, intra-coder agreement,
  and/or inter-coder agreement. Frequentist inference is supported for all levels
  of measurement. Bayesian inference is supported for interval and ratio scores.
