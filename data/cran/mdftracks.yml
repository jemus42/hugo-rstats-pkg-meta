maintainer: Gerhard Burger
description: |-
  'MTrackJ' is an 'ImageJ' plugin for motion tracking and analysis (see
  <https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/>). This package reads
  and writes 'MTrackJ Data Files' ('.mdf', see
  <https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/format/>). It supports
  2D data and read/writes cluster, point, and channel information. If desired,
  generates track identifiers that are unique over the clusters.
  See the project page for more information and examples.
