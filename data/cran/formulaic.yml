title: Dynamic Generation and Quality Checks of Formula Objects
maintainer: Anderson Nelson
description: Many statistical models and analyses in R are implemented through formula
  objects. The formulaic package creates a unified approach for programmatically and
  dynamically generating formula objects. Users may specify the outcome and inputs
  of a model directly, search for variables to include based upon naming patterns,
  incorporate interactions, and identify variables to exclude. A wide range of quality
  checks are implemented to identify issues such as misspecified variables, duplication,
  a lack of contrast in the inputs, and a large number of levels in categorical data.  Variables
  that do not meet these quality checks can be automatically excluded from the model.  These
  issues are documented and reported in a manner that provides greater accountability
  and useful information to guide an investigation of the data.
