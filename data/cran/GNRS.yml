title: Access the 'Geographic Name Resolution Service'
maintainer: Brian Maitner
description: 'Provides tools for interacting with the ''geographic name resolution
  service'' (''GNRS'') API <https://github.com/ojalaquellueva/gnrs> and associated
  functionality. The ''GNRS'' is a batch application for resolving & standardizing
  political division names against standard name in the geonames database <http://www.geonames.org/>.
  The ''GNRS'' resolves political division names at three levels: country, state/province
  and county/parish. Resolution is performed in a series of steps, beginning with
  direct matching to standard names, followed by direct matching to alternate names
  in different languages, followed by direct matching to standard codes (such as ISO
  and FIPS codes). If direct matching fails, the ''GNRS'' attempts to match to standard
  and then alternate names using fuzzy matching, but does not perform fuzzing matching
  of political division codes. The ''GNRS'' works down the political division hierarchy,
  stopping at the current level if all matches fail. In other words, if a country
  cannot be matched, the ''GNRS'' does not attempt to match state or county.'
