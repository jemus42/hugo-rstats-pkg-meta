title: Interactive Q-Q and Manhattan Plots Using 'plotly.js'
maintainer: Sahir Bhatnagar
description: |-
  Create interactive Q-Q, manhattan and volcano plots that are usable from the R console,
  in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents, and in 'Shiny' apps.
  Hover the mouse pointer over a point to show details or drag a rectangle to
  zoom. A manhattan plot is a popular graphical method for visualizing results
  from high-dimensional data analysis such as a (epi)genome wide association study
  (GWAS or EWAS), in which p-values, Z-scores, test statistics are plotted on a scatter
  plot against their genomic position. Manhattan plots are used for visualizing
  potential regions of interest in the genome that are associated with a phenotype.
  Interactive manhattan plots allow the inspection of specific value (e.g. rs number or
  gene name) by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the
  genome (e.g. a chromosome) by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area.
  This work is based on the 'qqman' package by Stephen Turner and the 'plotly.js'
  engine. It produces similar manhattan and Q-Q plots as the 'manhattan' and 'qq'
  functions in the 'qqman' package, with the advantage of including extra annotation
  information and interactive web-based visualizations directly from R.
  Once uploaded to a 'plotly' account, 'plotly' graphs (and the data behind them)
  can be viewed and modified in a web browser.
