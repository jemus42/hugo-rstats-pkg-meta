title: Taxonomic Classes
maintainer: Zachary Foster
description: |-
  Provides taxonomic classes for
  groupings of taxonomic names without data, and those
  with data. Methods provided are "taxonomically aware", in
  that they know about ordering of ranks, and methods that
  filter based on taxonomy also filter associated data.
  This package is described in the publication: "Taxa: An R
  package implementing data standards and methods for
  taxonomic data", Zachary S.L. Foster, Scott Chamberlain,
  Niklaus J. Gr√ºnwald (2018) <doi:10.12688/f1000research.14013.2>.
