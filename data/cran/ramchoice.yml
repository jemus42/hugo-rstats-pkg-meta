title: Estimation and Inference in Random Attention Models
maintainer: Xinwei Ma
description: It is widely documented in psychology, economics and other disciplines
  that socio-economic agent may not pay full attention to all available alternatives,
  rendering standard revealed preference theory invalid. This package implements the
  estimation and inference procedures of Cattaneo, Ma, Masatlioglu and Suleymanov
  (2019) <arXiv:1712.03448>, which utilizes standard choice data to partially identify
  and estimate a decision maker's preference. For inference, several simulation-based
  critical values are provided.
