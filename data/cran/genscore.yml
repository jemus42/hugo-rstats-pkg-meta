maintainer: Shiqing Yu
description: Implementation of the Generalized Score Matching estimator in Yu et al.
  (2019) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-278.html> for non-negative graphical models
  (truncated Gaussian, exponential square-root, gamma, a-b models) and univariate
  truncated Gaussian distributions. Also includes the original estimator for untruncated
  Gaussian graphical models from Lin et al. (2016) <doi:10.1214/16-EJS1126>, with
