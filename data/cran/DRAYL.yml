title: Computation of Rayleigh Densities of Arbitrary Dimension
maintainer: Martin Wiegand
description: |-
  We offer an implementation of the series representation put
  forth in "A series representation for multidimensional
  Rayleigh distributions" by Wiegand and Nadarajah <DOI:
  10.1002/dac.3510>. Furthermore we have implemented an
  integration approach proposed by Beaulieu et al. for 3 and
  4-dimensional Rayleigh densities (Beaulieu, Zhang,  "New
  simplest exact forms for the 3D and 4D multivariate Rayleigh
  PDFs with applications to antenna array geometrics", <DOI:
  10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2709307>).
