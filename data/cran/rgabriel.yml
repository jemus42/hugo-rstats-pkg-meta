  Gabriel Multiple Comparison Test and Plot the Confidence
  Interval on Barplot
maintainer: Miao YU
description: |-
  This package was created to analyze multi-level one-way
  experimental designs. It is designed to handle vectorized
  observation and factor data where there are unequal sample
  sizes and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed.
  To conduct the Gabriel test, create two vectors: one for your
  observations and one for the factor level of each observation.
  The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and save the output as
  a vector to input into the gabriel.plot function, which produces
  a confidence interval plot for Multiple Comparison.
