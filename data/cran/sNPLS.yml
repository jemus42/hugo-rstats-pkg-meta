title: NPLS Regression with L1 Penalization
maintainer: David Hervas
description: |-
  Tools for performing variable selection in three-way data using N-PLS
  in combination with L1 penalization. The N-PLS model (Rasmus Bro, 1996
  <DOI:10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199601)10:1%3C47::AID-CEM400%3E3.0.CO;2-C>) is the
  natural extension of PLS (Partial Least Squares) to N-way structures, and tries
  to maximize the covariance between X and Y data arrays. The package also adds
  variable selection through L1 penalization.
