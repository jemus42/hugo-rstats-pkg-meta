  Efficient Calculation of Fine Structure Isotope Patterns via
  Fourier Transforms of Simplex-Based Elemental Models
maintainer: Andreas Ipsen
description: |-
  Provides a function that quickly computes the fine structure
  isotope patterns of a set of chemical formulas to a given degree of
  accuracy (up to the limit set by errors in floating point arithmetic). A
  data-set comprising the masses and isotopic abundances of individual
  elements is also provided and calculation of isotopic gross structures
  is also supported.
