title: Tools to Support Evidence Synthesis
maintainer: Martin J. Westgate
description: Researchers commonly need to summarize scientific information, a process
  known as 'evidence synthesis'. The first stage of a synthesis process (such as a
  systematic review or meta-analysis) is to download a list of references from academic
  search engines such as 'Web of Knowledge' or 'Scopus'. The traditional approach
  to systematic review is then to sort these data manually, first by locating and
  removing duplicated entries, and then screening to remove irrelevant content by
  viewing titles and abstracts (in that order). 'revtools' provides interfaces for
  each of these tasks. An alternative approach, however, is to draw on tools from
  machine learning to visualise patterns in the corpus. In this case, you can use
  'revtools' to render ordinations of text drawn from article titles, keywords and
  abstracts, and interactively select or exclude individual references, words or topics.
