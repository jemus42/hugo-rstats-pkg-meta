title: SciViews - Manage GUIs in R
maintainer: Philippe Grosjean
description: |-
  The SciViews svGUI package eases the management of Graphical User
  Interfaces (GUI) in R. It is independent from any particular GUI widgets (Tk,
  Gtk2, native, ...). It centralizes info about GUI elements currently used,
  and it dispatches GUI calls to the particular toolkits in use in function of
  the context (is R run at the terminal, within a Tk application, a HTML page?).
