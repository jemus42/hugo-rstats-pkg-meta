title: Shape Constrained Additive Models
maintainer: Natalya Pya
description: |-
  Routines for generalized additive modelling under shape
  constraints on the component functions of the linear predictor
  (Pya and Wood, 2015) <doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9448-7>.
  Models can contain multiple shape constrained (univariate
  and/or bivariate) and unconstrained terms. The routines of gam()
  in package 'mgcv' are used for setting up the model matrix,
  printing and plotting the results.  Penalized likelihood
  maximization based on Newton-Raphson method is used to fit a
  model with multiple smoothing parameter selection by GCV or
  UBRE/AIC.
