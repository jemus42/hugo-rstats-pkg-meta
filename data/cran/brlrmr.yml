title: Bias Reduction with Missing Binary Response
maintainer: Arnab Maity
description: Provides two main functions, il() and fil(). The il() function implements
  the EM algorithm developed by Ibrahim and Lipsitz (1996) <DOI:10.2307/2533068> to
  estimate the parameters of a logistic regression model with the missing response
  when the missing data mechanism is nonignorable. The fil() function implements the
  algorithm proposed by Maity et. al. (2017+) <https://github.com/arnabkrmaity/brlrmr>
  to reduce the bias produced by the method of Ibrahim and Lipsitz (1996) <DOI:10.2307/2533068>.
