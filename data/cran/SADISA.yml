  Species Abundance Distributions with Independent-Species
  Assumption
maintainer: Rampal S. Etienne
description: 'Computes the probability of a set of species abundances of a single
  or multiple samples of individuals with one or more guilds under a mainland-island
  model. One must specify the mainland (metacommunity) model and the island (local)
  community model. It assumes that species fluctuate independently. The package also
  contains functions to simulate under this model. See Haegeman, B. & R.S. Etienne
  (2017). A general sampling formula for community structure data. Methods in Ecology
  & Evolution 8: 1506-1519 <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12807>.'
