  The Lasso for the Tweedie's Compound Poisson Model Using an
  IRLS-BMD Algorithm
maintainer: Wei Qian
description: This package implements a iteratively reweighed least square (IRLS) strategy
  that incorporates a blockwise majorization decent (BMD) method, for efficiently
  computing the solution paths of the (grouped) lasso and the (grouped) elastic net
  for the Tweedie model.
