title: Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of ecological count data
maintainer: James A. Fordyce
description: This program implements a hierarchical Bayesian analysis<U+000a>of count
  data, such as preference experiments. It provides<U+000a>population-level and individual-level
  preference parameter<U+000a>estimates obtained via MCMC. It also allows for model<U+000a>comparison
  using Deviance Information Criterion.
