title: Kinetic Evaluation of Chemical Degradation Data
maintainer: Johannes Ranke
description: |-
  Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006,
  2014).  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation
  models, model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
  solvers.  If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
  equation models are solved using automatically generated C functions.  Please
  note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness for a
  particular purpose.
