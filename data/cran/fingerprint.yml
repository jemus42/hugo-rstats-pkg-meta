title: Functions to Operate on Binary Fingerprint Data
maintainer: Rajarshi Guha
description: |-
  Functions to manipulate binary fingerprints
  of arbitrary length. A fingerprint is represented by an object of S4 class 'fingerprint'
  which is internally represented a vector of integers, such
  that each element represents the position in the fingerprint that is set to 1.
  The bitwise logical functions in R are overridden so that they can be used directly
  with 'fingerprint' objects. A number of distance metrics are also
  available (many contributed by Michael Fadock). Fingerprints
  can be converted to Euclidean vectors (i.e., points on the unit hypersphere) and
  can also be folded using OR.  Arbitrary fingerprint formats can be handled via line
  handlers. Currently handlers are provided for CDK, MOE and BCI fingerprint data.
