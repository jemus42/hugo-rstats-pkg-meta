title: Table 1 Heatmap
maintainer: Philip C Schouten
description: |-
  Table 1 is the classical way to describe the patients in a
  clinical study. The amount of splits in the data in such a table is
  limited. Table1Heatmap draws a heatmap of all crosstables that can be
  generated with the data. Users can choose between showing the actual
  crosstables or direction of effect of associations, and highlight
  associations by number of patients or p-values.
