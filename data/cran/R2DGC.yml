  Multiple Peak Alignment for 2D Gas Chromatography Mass
  Spectrometry Metabolomics Analysis
maintainer: Ryne Ramaker
description: |-
  Provides functions for aligning 2D gas chromatography mass spectrometry derived metabolite peaks obtained from primary processing and generates an alignment table that
  allows for a comparison of common peaks across samples and metabolite identification. Publication describing the package in detail is available at the following citation: Ryne C. Ramaker, Emily Gordon, Sara J. Cooper (2017) <doi:10.1101/179168>.
