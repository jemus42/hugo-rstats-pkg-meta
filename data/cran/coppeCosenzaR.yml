title: COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model
maintainer: Pier Taranti
description: |-
  The program implements the COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model.
  The model was based on the evaluation of local alternatives, representing
  regional potentialities, so as to fulfill demands of economic projects.
  After defining demand profiles in terms of their technological coefficients,
  the degree of importance of factors is defined so as to represent
  the productive activity. The method can detect a surplus of supply without
  the restriction of the distance of classical algebra, defining a hierarchy
  of location alternatives. In COPPE-Cosenza Model, the distance between
  factors is measured in terms of the difference between grades of memberships
  of the same factors belonging to two or more  sets under comparison. The
  required factors are classified under the following linguistic variables:
  Critical (CR); Conditioning (C); Little Conditioning (LC); and Irrelevant
  (I). And the alternatives can assume the following linguistic variables:
  Excellent (Ex), Good (G), Regular (R), Weak (W), Empty (Em), Zero (Z) and
  Inexistent (In). The model also provides flexibility, allowing different
  aggregation rules to be performed and defined by the Decision Maker. Such
  feature is considered in this package, allowing the user to define other
  aggregation matrices, since it considers the same linguistic variables
  mentioned.
