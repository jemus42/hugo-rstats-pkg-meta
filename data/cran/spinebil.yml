title: Investigating New Projection Pursuit Index Functions
maintainer: Ursula Laa
description: |-
  Projection pursuit is used to find interesting low-dimensional
  projections of high-dimensional data by optimizing an index over all
  possible projections. The 'spinebil' package contains methods to evaluate
  the performance of projection pursuit index functions using tour methods,
  as described in Laa & Cook (2019) <arXiv:1902.00181>.
