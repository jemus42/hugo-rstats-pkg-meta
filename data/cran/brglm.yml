title: Bias Reduction in Binomial-Response Generalized Linear Models
maintainer: Ioannis Kosmidis
description: Fit generalized linear models with binomial responses using either an
  adjusted-score approach to bias reduction or maximum penalized likelihood where
  penalization is by Jeffreys invariant prior. These procedures return estimates with
  improved frequentist properties (bias, mean squared error) that are always finite
  even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (data separation).
  Fitting takes place by fitting generalized linear models on iteratively updated
  pseudo-data. The interface is essentially the same as 'glm'.  More flexibility is
  provided by the fact that custom pseudo-data representations can be specified and
  used for model fitting. Functions are provided for the construction of confidence
  intervals for the reduced-bias estimates.
