title: latent effect adjustment after primary projection
maintainer: Yunting Sun
description: |-
  These functions take a gene expression value matrix, a
  primary covariate vector, an additional known covariates
  matrix.  A two stage analysis is applied to counter the effects
  of latent variables on the rankings of hypotheses.  The
  estimation and adjustment of latent effects are proposed by
  Sun, Zhang and Owen (2011).  "leapp" is developed in the
  context of microarray experiments, but may be used as a general
  tool for high throughput data sets where dependence may be
  involved.
