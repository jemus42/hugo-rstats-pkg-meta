title: Bayesian t-Test
maintainer: Riko Kelter
description: Provides an Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo algorithm for Bayesian t-tests on
  the effect size. The underlying Gibbs sampler is based on a two-component Gaussian
  mixture and approximates the posterior distributions of the effect size, the difference
  of means and difference of standard deviations. A posterior analysis of the effect
  size via the region of practical equivalence is provided, too. For more details
  about the Gibbs sampler see Kelter (2019) <arXiv:1906.07524>.
