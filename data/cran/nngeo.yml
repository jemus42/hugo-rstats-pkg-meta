title: k-Nearest Neighbor Join for Spatial Data
maintainer: Michael Dorman
description: K-nearest neighbor search for projected and non-projected 'sf' spatial
  layers. Nearest neighbor search uses (1) C code from 'GeographicLib' for lon-lat
  point layers, (2) function nn2() from package 'RANN' for projected point layers,
  or (3) function st_distance() from package 'sf' for line or polygon layers. The
  package also includes several other utility functions for spatial analysis.
