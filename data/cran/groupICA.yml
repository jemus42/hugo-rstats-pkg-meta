version: 0.1.1
title: Independent Component Analysis for Grouped Data
maintainer: Niklas Pfister
description: Contains an implementation of an independent component analysis (ICA)
  for grouped data. The main function groupICA() performs a blind source separation,
  by maximizing an independence across sources and allows to adjust for varying confounding
  for user-specified groups. Additionally, the package contains the function uwedge()
  which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize a list of matrices. For more
  details see the project website <https://sweichwald.de/groupICA/>.
