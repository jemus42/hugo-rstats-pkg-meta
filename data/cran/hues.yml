title: Distinct Colour Palettes Based on 'iwanthue'
maintainer: John Baumgartner
description: |-
  Creating effective colour palettes for figures is
  challenging. This package generates and plot palettes of optimally
  distinct colours in perceptually uniform colour space, based on
  'iwanthue' <http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/>.
  This is done through k-means clustering of CIE Lab colour space,
  according to user-selected constraints on hue, chroma, and
  lightness.
