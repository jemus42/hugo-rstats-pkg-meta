title: Bi-Level Optimization of Metabolic Network Models
maintainer: Daniel Hartleb
description: Initial metabolic networks often inaccurately predict in-silico growth
  or non-growth if compared to in-vivo data. This package refines metabolic network
  models by making networks changes (i.e., removing, adding, changing reversibility
  of reactions; adding and removing biomass metabolites) and simultaneously matching
  sets of experimental growth and non-growth data (e.g., KO-mutants, mutants grown
  under different media conditions,...)
