title: '''Yingyang'' K-Means and K-NN using NVIDIA CUDA'
maintainer: Charles Determan
description: 'K-means implementation is base on "Yingyang K-Means: A Drop-In Replacement
  of the Classic K-Means with Consistent Speedup". While it introduces some overhead
  and many conditional clauses which are bad for CUDA, it still shows 1.6-2x speedup
  against the Lloyd algorithm.  K-nearest neighbors employ the same triangle inequality
  idea and require precalculated centroids and cluster assignments, similar to the
  flattened ball tree.'
