  Construct Polygons Summarising the Location and Variability of
  Point Sets
maintainer: Jonathan Keith
description: |-
  Various applications in invasive species biology,
  conservation biology, epidemiology and elsewhere involve
  sampling of sets of 2D points from a posterior distribution.
  The number of such point sets may be large, say 1000 or 10000.
  This package facilitates visualisation of such output by
  constructing seven nested polygons representing the location and
  variability of the point sets. This can be used, for example, to
  visualise the range boundary of a species, and uncertainty in
  the location of that boundary.
