title: Generalized Multistate Simulation Model
maintainer: Luisa Salazar Vizcaya
description: |-
  Simulate and analyze multistate models with general hazard
  functions. gems provides functionality for the preparation of hazard functions
  and parameters, simulation from a general multistate model and predicting future
  events. The multistate model is not required to be a Markov model and may take
  the history of previous events into account. In the basic version, it allows
  to simulate from transition-specific hazard function, whose parameters are
  multivariable normally distributed.
