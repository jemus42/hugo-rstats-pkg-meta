  Providing 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE' Variants of 'data.frame()'
  and 'as.data.frame()'
maintainer: Peter Meissner
description: |-
  Base R's default setting for 'stringsAsFactors' within
  'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()' is supposedly the most often complained
  about piece of code in the R infrastructure. The 'hellno' package provides
  an explicit solution without changing R itself or having to mess around with
  options. It tries to solve this problem by providing alternative
  'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()' functions that are in fact simple
  wrappers around base R's 'data.frame()' and 'as.data.frame()' with
  'stringsAsFactors' option set to 'HELLNO' ( which in turn equals FALSE )
  by default.
