title: Continuous-Lag Spatial Markov Chains
maintainer: Luca Sartore
description: A set of functions is provided for 1) the stratum lengths analysis along
  a chosen direction, 2) fast estimation of continuous lag spatial Markov chains model
  parameters and probability computing (also for large data sets), 3) transition probability
  maps and transiograms drawing, 4) simulation methods for categorical random fields.
