maintainer: Thierry Warin
description: 'In 2015, The 17 United Nations'' Sustainable Development Goals were
  adopted. ''spiR'' is a wrapper of several open datasets published by the Social
  Progress Imperative (<https://www.socialprogress.org/>), including the Social Progress
  Index (a synthetic measure of human development across the world). ''spiR''''s goal
  is to provide data to help policymakers and researchers prioritize actions that
  accelerate social progress across the world in the context of the Sustainable Development
  Goals. Please cite: Warin, Th. (2019) "spiR: An R Package for the Social Progress
  Index", <doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.11421573>.'
