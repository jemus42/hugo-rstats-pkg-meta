title: Simulating Forest Growth using the 3-PG Model
maintainer: Volodymyr Trotsiuk
description: Provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for the Physiological Processes
  Predicting Growth (3-PG) model written in Fortran. The r3PG serves as a flexible
  and easy-to-use interface for the 3-PGpjs (monospecific, evenaged and evergreen
  forests) described in Landsberg & Waring (1997) <doi:10.1016/S0378-1127(97)00026-1>
  and the 3-PGmix (deciduous, uneven-aged or mixed-species forests) described in Forrester
  & Tang (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.07.010>.
