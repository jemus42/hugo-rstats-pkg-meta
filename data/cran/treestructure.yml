title: Detect Population Structure Within Phylogenetic Trees
maintainer: Erik Volz
description: Algorithms for detecting population structure from the history of coalescent
  events recorded in phylogenetic trees. This method classifies each tip and internal
  node of a tree into disjoint sets characterized by similar coalescent patterns.
  The methods are described in Volz, E., Wiuf, C., Grad, Y., Frost, S., Dennis, A.,
  & Didelot, X. (2020) <doi:10.1093/sysbio/syaa009>.
