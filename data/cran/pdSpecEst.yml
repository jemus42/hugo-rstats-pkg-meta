title: An Analysis Toolbox for Hermitian Positive Definite Matrices
maintainer: Joris Chau
description: |-
  An implementation of data analysis tools for samples of symmetric or
  Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as collections of covariance matrices
  or spectral density matrices. The tools in this package can be used to perform: (i)
  intrinsic wavelet transforms for curves (1D) or surfaces (2D) of Hermitian positive
  definite matrices with applications to dimension reduction, denoising and clustering in the
  space of Hermitian positive definite matrices; and (ii) exploratory data analysis and inference
  for samples of positive definite matrices by means of intrinsic data depth functions and
  rank-based hypothesis tests in the space of Hermitian positive definite matrices.
