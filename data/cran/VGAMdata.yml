description: |-
  Data sets to accompany the VGAM package and
  the book "Vector Generalized Linear and
  Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015)
  <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7>.
  These are used to illustrate vector generalized
  linear and additive models (VGLMs/VGAMs), and associated models
  (Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column
  Interaction Models, and constrained and unconstrained ordination
  models in ecology).
