version: 1.1.7
title: eXtraction of ENTity
maintainer: Tien T. Phan
description: Provides a tool for extracting information (entities and relations between
  them) in text datasets. It also emphasizes the results exploration with graphical
  displays. It is a rule-based system and works with hand-made dictionaries and local
  grammars defined by users. 'x.ent' uses parsing with Perl functions and JavaScript
  to define user preferences through a browser and R to display and support analysis
  of the results extracted. Local grammars are defined and compiled with the tool
  Unitex, a tool developed by University Paris Est that supports multiple languages.
  See ?xconfig for an introduction.
