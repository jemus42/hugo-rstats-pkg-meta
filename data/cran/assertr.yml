title: Assertive Programming for R Analysis Pipelines
maintainer: Tony Fischetti
description: |-
  Provides functionality to assert conditions
  that have to be met so that errors in data used in
  analysis pipelines can fail quickly. Similar to
  'stopifnot()' but more powerful, friendly, and easier
  for use in pipelines.
