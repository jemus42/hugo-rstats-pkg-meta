title: Sensitivity Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations
maintainer: Dirk Surmann
description: |-
  Performs sensitivity analysis in ordinary differential equation (ode) models.
  The package utilize the ode interface from 'deSolve' and connects it with the
  sensitivity analysis from 'sensitivity'. Additionally we add a method to
  run the sensitivity analysis on variables with class 'ODEnetwork'. A detailed
  plotting function provides outputs on the calculations.
  The method is described by Weber, Theers, Surmann, Ligges, and Weihs (2018) <doi:10.17877/DE290R-18874>.
