  Kaplan-Meier Multiple Imputation for the Analysis of Cumulative
  Incidence Functions in the Competing Risks Setting
maintainer: Arthur Allignol
description: Performs a Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation to recover the missing potential
  censoring information from competing risks events, so that standard right-censored
  methods could be applied to the imputed data sets to perform analyses of the cumulative
  incidence functions (Allignol and Beyersmann, 2010 <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxq018>).
