title: Local Polynomial Density Estimation and Inference
maintainer: Xinwei Ma
description: 'Without imposing stringent distributional assumptions or shape restrictions,
  nonparametric density estimation has been popular in economics and other social
  sciences for counterfactual analysis, program evaluation, and policy recommendations.
  This package implements a novel density estimator based on local polynomial regressions,
  documented in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2019a, b) <arXiv:1811.11512, arXiv:1906.06529>:
  lpdensity() to construct local polynomial based density (and derivatives) estimator;
  lpbwdensity() to perform data-driven bandwidth selection; and lpdensity.plot() for
  density plot with robust confidence interval.'
