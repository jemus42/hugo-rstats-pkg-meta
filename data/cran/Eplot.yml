title: Plotting longitudinal series
maintainer: Eran Raviv
description: 'Aim: Adjust the graphical parameters to create nicer<U+000a>longitudinal
  series plots. The default set of graphical parameters is very<U+000a>general, and
  can be improved upon when we are interested in plotting data<U+000a>points observed
  over time. Functions facilitate plotting those kind of<U+000a>series, univariate
  plots, bivariate plots (with vertical axis on both left<U+000a>and right hand sides),
  multivariate plots and plots which allow to examine<U+000a>whether a new observation
  is ''unusual'' via construction and visualization<U+000a>of prediction intervals
  around it.'
