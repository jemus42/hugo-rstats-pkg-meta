  Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares
  (MCR-ALS)
maintainer: Katharine Mullen
description: |-
  Alternating least squares is often used to resolve
  components contributing to data with a bilinear structure; the
  basic technique may be extended to alternating constrained
  least squares.  Commonly applied constraints include
  unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of components.
  Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by
  assuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear
  decomposition is shared between datasets.
