title: Constructs Asymmetric Hidden Markov Models
maintainer: Arjen Hommersom
description: |-
  Asymmetric hidden Markov model (HMM-A) learning.
  HMM-As are similar to regular HMMs, but use Bayesian Networks (BNs) in
  their emission distribution. The HMM-As can therefore offer more problem
  insight [Bueno et al. 2017, <doi:10.1016/j.ijar.2017.05.011>].
