title: Functions for Processing Accelerometer Data
maintainer: Dane R. Van Domelen
description: A collection of functions that perform operations on time-series accelerometer
  data, such as identify non-wear time, flag minutes that are part of an activity
  bout, and find the maximum 10-minute average count value. The functions are generally
  very flexible, allowing for a variety of algorithms to be implemented. Most of the
  functions are written in C++ for efficiency.
