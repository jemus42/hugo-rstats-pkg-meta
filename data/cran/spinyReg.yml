title: Sparse Generative Model and Its EM Algorithm
maintainer: Julien Chiquet
description: |-
  Implements a generative model that uses a
  spike-and-slab like prior distribution obtained by multiplying a
  deterministic binary vector. Such a model allows an EM algorithm,
  optimizing a type-II log-likelihood.
