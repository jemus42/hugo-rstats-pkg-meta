title: Sample Size Calculations for Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Michael C. Donohue
description: |-
  Compute power and sample size for linear models of longitudinal
  data. Supported models include mixed-effects models and models fit by
  generalized least squares and generalized estimating equations. Relevant
  formulas are derived by Liu and Liang (1997) <DOI:10.2307/2533554>,
  Diggle et al (2002) <ISBN:9780199676750>, and Lu, Luo, and Chen (2008)
  <DOI:10.2202/1557-4679.1098>.
