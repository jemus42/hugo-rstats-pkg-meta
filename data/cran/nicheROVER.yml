  (Niche) (R)egion and Niche (Over)lap Metrics for
  Multidimensional Ecological Niches
maintainer: Martin Lysy
description: |-
  This package uses a probabilistic method to calculate niche
  regions and pairwise niche overlap using multidimensional niche indicator
  data (e.g., stable isotopes, environmental variables, etc.). The niche
  region is defined as the joint probability density function of the
  multidimensional niche indicators at a user-defined probability alpha
  (e.g., 95%).  Uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework, and the
  method can be extended to three or more indicator dimensions.  It provides
  directional estimates of niche overlap, accounts for species-specific
  distributions in multivariate niche space, and produces unique and
  consistent bivariate projections of the multivariate niche region.  A
  forthcoming article by Swanson et al. (Ecology, 2014) provides a detailed
  description of the methodology.  See the package vignette for a worked
  example using fish stable isotope data.
