title: Genetics and Independence Testing of Mixed Genetic Panels
maintainer: Bing Song
description: Developed to deal with multi-locus genotype data, this package is especially
  designed for those panel which include different type of markers. Basic genetic
  parameters like allele frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg
  test of mixed genetic data can be obtained.     In addition, a new test for mutual
  independence which is compatible for mixed genetic data is developed in this package.
