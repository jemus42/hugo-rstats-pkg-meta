title: Constrained Triangulation for Simple Features
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Build a constrained Delaunay triangulation from simple features
  objects, applying constraints based on input line segments, and triangle
  properties including maximum area, minimum internal angle. The triangulation code
  in 'RTriangle' uses the method of Cheng, Dey and Shewchuk (2012, ISBN:9781584887300).
  For a low-dependency alternative with low-quality path-based constrained
  triangulation see <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=decido>.
