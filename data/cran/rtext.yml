version: 0.1.21
title: R6 Objects for Text and Data
maintainer: Peter Meissner
description: |-
  For natural language processing and analysis of qualitative text
  coding structures which provide a way to bind together text and text data
  are fundamental. The package provides such a structure and accompanying
  methods in form of R6 objects. The 'rtext' class allows for text handling
  and text coding (character or regex based) including data updates on
  text transformations as well as aggregation on various levels.
  Furthermore, the usage of R6 enables inheritance and passing by reference
  which should enable 'rtext' instances to be used as back-end for R based
  graphical text editors or text coding GUIs.
