title: Shape-Constrained Kernel Density Estimation
maintainer: Mark A. Wolters
description: |-
  Implements methods for obtaining kernel density estimates
  subject to a variety of shape constraints (unimodality, bimodality,
  symmetry, tail monotonicity, bounds, and constraints on the number of
  inflection points). Enforcing constraints can eliminate unwanted waves or
  kinks in the estimate, which improves its subjective appearance and can
  also improve statistical performance. The main function scdensity() is
  very similar to the density() function in 'stats', allowing
  shape-restricted estimates to be obtained with little effort. The
  methods implemented in this package are described in Wolters and Braun
