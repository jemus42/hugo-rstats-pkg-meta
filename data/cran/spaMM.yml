title: Mixed-Effect Models, Particularly Spatial Models
maintainer: Fran√ßois Rousset
description: Inference based on mixed-effect models, including generalized linear
  mixed models with spatial correlations and models with non-Gaussian random effects
  (e.g., Beta). Both classical geostatistical models, and Markov random field models
  on irregular grids, can be fitted. Variation in residual variance (heteroscedasticity)
  can itself be represented by a generalized linear mixed model. Various approximations
  of likelihood or restricted likelihood are implemented, in particular h-likelihood
  (Lee and Nelder 2001 <doi:10.1093/biomet/88.4.987>) and Laplace approximation.
