maintainer: Christian Hennig
description: |-
  Some M-estimators for 1-dimensional location (Bisquare, ML
  for the Cauchy distribution, and the estimators from
  application of the smoothing principle introduced in Hampel,
  Hennig and Ronchetti (2011) to the above, the Huber
  M-estimator, and the median, main function is smoothm), and
