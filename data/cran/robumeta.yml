title: Robust Variance Meta-Regression
maintainer: Zachary Fisher
description: Functions for conducting robust variance estimation (RVE) meta-regression
  using both large and small sample RVE estimators under various weighting schemes.
  These methods are distribution free and provide valid point estimates, standard
  errors and hypothesis tests even when the degree and structure of dependence between
  effect sizes is unknown. Also included are functions for conducting sensitivity
  analyses under correlated effects weighting and producing RVE-based forest plots.
