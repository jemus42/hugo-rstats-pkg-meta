title: Estimation of caribou abundance based on large scale<U+000a>aggregations monitored
  by radio telemetry
maintainer: Sophie Baillargeon
description: This is a package for estimating the population size of<U+000a>migratory
  caribou herds based on large scale aggregations<U+000a>monitored by radio telemetry.
  It implements the methodology<U+000a>found in the article by Rivest et al. (1998)
  about caribou<U+000a>abundance estimation. It also includes a function based on
  the<U+000a>Lincoln-Petersen Index as applied to radio telemetry data by<U+000a>White
  and Garrott (1990).
