title: Global, Parameterwise and Joint Shrinkage Factor Estimation
maintainer: Daniela Dunkler
description: |-
  The predictive value of a statistical model can often be improved
  by applying shrinkage methods. This can be achieved, e.g., by regularized
  regression or empirical Bayes approaches. Various types of shrinkage factors can
  also be estimated after a maximum likelihood. While global shrinkage modifies
  all regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors
  differ between regression coefficients. With variables which are either highly
  correlated or associated with regard to contents, such as several columns of a
  design matrix describing a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors are
  not interpretable and a compromise between global and parameterwise shrinkage,
  termed 'joint shrinkage', is a useful extension. A computational shortcut to
  resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation based on DFBETA residuals can be
  applied. Global, parameterwise and joint shrinkage for models fitted by lm(),
  glm(), coxph(), or mfp() is available.
