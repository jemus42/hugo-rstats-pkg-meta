  Automated Fitting of Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis Through
  the 'Mplus' Program
maintainer: Veronica Cole
description: |-
  Automated generation, running, and interpretation of moderated
  nonlinear factor analysis models for obtaining scores from observed
  variables. This package creates 'Mplus' input files which may be run iteratively
  to test two different types of covariate effects on items:
  (1) latent variable impact (both mean and variance); and (2) differential
  item functioning. After sequentially testing for all effects, it also creates a final
  model by including all significant effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
  Finally, the package creates a scoring model which uses the final values of parameter
  estimates to generate latent variable scores.
