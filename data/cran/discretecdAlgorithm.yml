  Coordinate-Descent Algorithm for Learning Sparse Discrete
  Bayesian Networks
maintainer: Jiaying Gu
description: |-
  Structure learning of Bayesian network using coordinate-descent
  algorithm. This algorithm is designed for discrete network assuming a multinomial data set,
  and we use a multi-logit model to do the regression.
  The algorithm is described in Gu, Fu and Zhou (2016) <arXiv:1403.2310>.
