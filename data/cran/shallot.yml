maintainer: David B. Dahl
description: Implementations are provided for the models described in the paper D.
  B. Dahl, R. Day, J. Tsai (2017) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2016.1165103>. The Ewens,
  Ewens-Pitman, Ewens attraction, Ewens-Pitman attraction, and ddCRP distributions
  are available for prior and posterior simulation. Posterior simulation is based
  on a user-supplied likelihood. Supporting functions for partition estimation and
  plotting are also provided.
