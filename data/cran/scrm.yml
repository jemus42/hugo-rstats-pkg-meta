title: Simulating the Evolution of Biological Sequences
maintainer: Paul Staab
description: |-
  A coalescent simulator that allows the rapid simulation of
  biological sequences under neutral models of evolution. Different to other
  coalescent based simulations, it has an optional approximation parameter that
  allows for high accuracy while maintaining a linear run time cost for long
  sequences. It is optimized for simulating massive data sets as produced by Next-
  Generation Sequencing technologies for up to several thousand sequences.
