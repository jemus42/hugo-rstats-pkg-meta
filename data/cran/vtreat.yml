title: A Statistically Sound 'data.frame' Processor/Conditioner
maintainer: John Mount
description: |-
  A 'data.frame' processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner.
  'vtreat' prepares variables so that data has fewer exceptional cases, making
  it easier to safely use models in production. Common problems 'vtreat' defends
  against: 'Inf', 'NA', too many categorical levels, rare categorical levels, and new
  categorical levels (levels seen during application, but not during training). Reference:
