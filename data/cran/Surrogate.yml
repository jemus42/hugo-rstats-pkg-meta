title: Evaluation of Surrogate Endpoints in Clinical Trials
maintainer: Wim Van der Elst
description: In a clinical trial, it frequently occurs that the most credible outcome
  to evaluate the effectiveness of a new therapy (the true endpoint) is difficult
  to measure. In such a situation, it can be an effective strategy to replace the
  true endpoint by a (bio)marker that is easier to measure and that allows for a prediction
  of the treatment effect on the true endpoint (a surrogate endpoint). The package
  'Surrogate' allows for an evaluation of the appropriateness of a candidate surrogate
  endpoint based on the meta-analytic, information-theoretic, and causal-inference
  frameworks. Part of this software has been developed using funding provided from
  the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development
  and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
