title: Mapping Markers to the Nearest Genomic Feature
maintainer: Lauren Hanna
description: |-
  Allows the user to generate a list of features (gene, pseudo, RNA,
  CDS, and/or UTR) directly from NCBI database for any species with a current
  build available. Option to save downloaded and formatted files is available,
  and the user can prioritize the feature list based on type and assembly builds
  present in the current build used. The user can then use the list of features
  generated or provide a list to map a set of markers (designed for SNP markers
  with a single base pair position available) to the closest feature based on
  the map build. This function does require map positions of the markers to be
  provided and the positions should be based on the build being queried through
  NCBI.
