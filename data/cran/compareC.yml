  Compare Two Correlated C Indices with Right-censored Survival
  Outcome
maintainer: Le Kang
description: Proposed by Harrell, the C index or concordance C, is considered an overall
  measure of discrimination in survival analysis between a survival outcome that is
  possibly right censored and a predictive-score variable, which can represent a measured
  biomarker or a composite-score output from an algorithm that combines multiple biomarkers.
  This package aims to statistically compare two C indices with right-censored survival
  outcome, which commonly arise from a paired design and thus resulting two correlated
  C indices.
