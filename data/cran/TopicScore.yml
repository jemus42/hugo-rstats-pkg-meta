title: The Topic SCORE Algorithm to Fit Topic Models
maintainer: Minzhe Wang
description: |-
  Provides implementation of the "Topic SCORE" algorithm that is
  proposed by Tracy Ke and Minzhe Wang. The singular value decomposition
  step is optimized through the usage of svds() function in 'RSpectra'
  package, on a 'dgRMatrix' sparse matrix. Also provides a column-wise
  error measure in the word-topic matrix A, and an algorithm for
  recovering the topic-document matrix W given A and D based on
  quadratic programming.
  The details about the techniques are explained in the paper "A new SVD approach to optimal topic estimation" by Tracy Ke and Minzhe Wang (2017) <arXiv:1704.07016>.
