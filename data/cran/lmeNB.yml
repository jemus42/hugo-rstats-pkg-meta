  Compute the Personalized Activity Index Based on a Negative
  Binomial Model

description: The functions in this package implement the safety monitoring procedures
  proposed in the paper titled "Detection of unusual increases in MRI lesion counts
  in individual multiple sclerosis patients" by Zhao, Y., Li, D.K.B., Petkau, A.J.,
  Riddehough, A., Traboulsee, A., published in Journal of the American Statistical
  Association in 2013. The procedure first models longitudinally collected count variables
  with a negative binomial mixed-effect regression model. To account for the correlation
  among repeated measures from the same patient, the model has subject-specific random
  intercept, which can be modelled with a gamma or log-normal distributions. One can
  also choose the semi-parametric option which does not assume any distribution for
  the random effect. These mixed-effect models could be useful beyond the application
  of the safety monitoring. The maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate the
  unknown fixed effect parameters of the model. Based on the fitted model, the personalized
  activity index is computed for each patient. Lastly, this package is companion to
  R package lmeNBBayes, which contains the functions to compute the Personalized Activity
  Index in Bayesian framework.
