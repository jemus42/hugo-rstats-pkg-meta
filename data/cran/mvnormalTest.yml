title: Powerful Tests for Multivariate Normality
maintainer: Yian Zhang
description: |-
  A simple informative powerful test (mvnTest()) for multivariate normality proposed by
  Zhou and Shao (2014) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2013.839637>, which combines kurtosis
  with Shapiro-Wilk test that is easy for biomedical researchers to understand and
  easy to implement in all dimensions. This package also contains some other multivariate
  normality tests including Fattorini's FA test (faTest()), Mardia's skewness and kurtosis
  test (mardia()), Henze-Zirkler's test (mhz()), Bowman and Shenton's test (msk()),
  Roystonâ€™s H test (msw()), and Villasenor-Alva and Gonzalez-Estrada's test (msw()). Empirical
  power calculation functions for these tests are also provided. In addition, this package
  includes some functions to generate several types of multivariate distributions mentioned in
  Zhou and Shao (2014).
