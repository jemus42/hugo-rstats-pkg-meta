  Simple Unified Interface to Read Bitmap Images
  (BMP,JPEG,PNG,TIFF)
maintainer: Gregory Jefferis
description: |-
  Identifies and reads Windows BMP, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF format bitmap
  images. Identification defaults to the use of the magic number embedded in
  the file rather than the file extension. Reading of JPEG and PNG image
  depends on libjpg and libpng libraries. See file INSTALL for details if
  necessary.
