  Bootstrap Test for the Similarity of Dose Response Curves
  Concerning the Maximum Absolute Deviation
maintainer: Kathrin Moellenhoff
description: Provides a bootstrap test which decides whether two dose response curves
  can be assumed as equal concerning their maximum absolute deviation. A plenty of
  choices for the model types are available, which can be found in the 'DoseFinding'
  package, which is used for the fitting of the models. See <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1281813>
