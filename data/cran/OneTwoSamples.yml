title: Deal with one and two (normal) samples
maintainer: Ying-Ying Zhang (Robert)
description: |-
  In this package, we introduce an R function
  one_two_sample() which can deal with one and two (normal)
  samples. For one normal sample x, the function reports
  descriptive statistics, plot, interval estimation and test of
  hypothesis of x. For two normal samples x and y, the function
  reports descriptive statistics, plot, interval estimation and
  test of hypothesis of x and y, respectively. It also reports
  interval estimation and test of hypothesis of mu1-mu2 (the
  difference of the means of x and y) and sigma1^2 / sigma2^2
  (the ratio of the variances of x and y), tests whether x and y
  are from the same population, finds the correlation coefficient
  of x and y if x and y have the same length.
