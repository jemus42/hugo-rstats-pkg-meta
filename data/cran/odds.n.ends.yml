  Odds Ratios, Contingency Table, and Model Significance from a
  Generalized Linear Model Object
maintainer: Jenine Harris
description: Computes odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from a generalized
  linear model object. It also computes model significance with the chi-squared statistic
  and p-value and it computes model fit using a contingency table to determine the
  percent of observations for which the model correctly predicts the value of the
  outcome. Calculates model sensitivity and specificity.
