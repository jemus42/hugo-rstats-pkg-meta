title: An R Package for Text Analysis
maintainer: Meik Michalke
description: |-
  A set of tools to analyze texts. Includes, amongst others,
  functions for automatic language detection, hyphenation,
  several indices of lexical diversity (e.g., type token ratio,
  HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD) and readability (e.g., Flesch, SMOG, LIX,
  Dale-Chall). Basic import functions for language corpora are
  also provided, to enable frequency analyses (supports Celex and
  Leipzig Corpora Collection file formats) and measures like
  tf-idf. Note: For full functionality a local installation of
  TreeTagger is recommended. It is also recommended to not load
  this package directly, but by loading one of the available
  language support packages from the 'l10n' repository
  <https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos/l10n>. 'koRpus' also
  includes a plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard, providing
  graphical dialogs for its basic features. The respective R
  package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a
  repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of this
  feature, please install RKWard from <https://rkward.kde.org>
  (plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions
  on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the
  project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request
  features, or discuss the development of the package, please
  subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
  (<http://korpusml.reaktanz.de>).
