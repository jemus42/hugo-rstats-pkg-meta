  Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering Models with Covariates and a
  Noise Component
maintainer: Keefe Murphy
description: Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust
  models introduced by Murphy and Murphy (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11634-019-00373-8>.
  This package fits finite Gaussian mixture models with a formula interface for supplying
  gating and/or expert network covariates using a range of parsimonious covariance
  parameterisations from the GPCM family via the EM/CEM algorithm. Visualisation of
  the results of such models using generalised pairs plots and the inclusion of an
  additional noise component is also facilitated. A greedy forward stepwise search
  algorithm is provided for identifying the optimal model in terms of the number of
  components, the GPCM covariance parameterisation, and the subsets of gating/expert
  network covariates.
