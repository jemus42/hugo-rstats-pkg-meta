version: 0.2.5
title: Deterministic Computation of Text Box Metrics
maintainer: Lionel Henry
description: |-
  Unlike other tools that dynamically link to the 'Cairo'
  stack, 'freetypeharfbuzz' is statically linked to specific
  versions of the 'FreeType' and 'harfbuzz' libraries (2.9 and 1.7.6
  respectively). This ensures deterministic computation of text box
  extents for situations where reproducible results are crucial (for
  instance unit tests of graphics).
