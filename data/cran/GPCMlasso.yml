  Differential Item Functioning in Generalized Partial Credit
  Models
maintainer: Gunther Schauberger
description: Provides a framework to detect Differential Item Functioning (DIF) in
  Generalized Partial Credit Models (GPCM) and special cases of the GPCM as proposed
  by Schauberger and Mair (2019) <doi:10.3758/s13428-019-01224-2>. A joint model is
  set up where DIF is explicitly parametrized and penalized likelihood estimation
  is used for parameter selection. The big advantage of the method called GPCMlasso
  is that several variables can be treated simultaneously and that both continuous
  and categorical variables can be used to detect DIF.
