title: Regularized Estimators of Covariance Matrices with CV Tuning
maintainer: Binhuan Wang
description: 'This is a package for selecting tuning parameters based on cross-validation
  (CV) in regularized estimators of large covariance matrices. Four regularized methods
  are implemented: banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. Two
  types of matrix norms are applied: Frobenius norm and operator norm. Two types of
  CV are considered: K-fold CV and random CV. Usually K-fold CV use K-1 folds to train
  a model and the rest one fold to validate the model. The reverse version trains
  a model with 1 fold and validates with the rest with K-1 folds. Random CV randomly
  splits the data set to two parts, a training set and a validation set with user-specified
  sizes.'
