title: Inhomogeneous Poisson Point Processes
maintainer: Niklas Hohmann
description: Generates random numbers corresponding to the events on a Poisson point
  process with changing event rates. This includes the possibility to incorporate
  additional information such as the number of events occurring or the location of
  an already known event. It can also generate the probability density functions of
  specific events in the cases where additional information is available. Based on
  Hohmann (2019) <arXiv:1901.10754>.
