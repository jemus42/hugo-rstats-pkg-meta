title: Monte Carlo Standard Errors for MCMC
maintainer: Dootika Vats
description: |-
  Provides tools for computing Monte Carlo standard
  errors (MCSE) in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) settings. MCSE
  computation for expectation and quantile estimators is
  supported as well as multivariate estimations. The package also provides
  functions for computing effective sample size and for plotting
  Monte Carlo estimates versus sample size.
