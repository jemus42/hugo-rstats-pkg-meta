title: Focused, Interactive Multidimensional Scaling
maintainer: Lea Urpa
description: |-
  Takes a distance matrix and plots it as an
  interactive graph. One point is focused at the center of the graph,
  around which all other points are plotted in their exact distances as
  given in the distance matrix. All other non-focus points are plotted
  as best as possible in relation to one another. Double click on any
  point to choose a new focus point, and hover over points to see their
  ID labels. If color label categories are given, hover over colors in
  the legend to highlight only those points and click on colors to
  highlight multiple groups. For more information on the rationale
  and mathematical background, as well as an interactive introduction,
  see <https://lea-urpa.github.io/focusedMDS.html>.
