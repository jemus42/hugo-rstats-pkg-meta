title: Inter-Event Time Definition
maintainer: Luis F. Duque
description: |-
  Computes characteristics of independent rainfall events (duration, total rainfall depth, and intensity)
  extracted from a sub-daily rainfall time series based on the inter-event time definition (IETD) method. To have a
  reference value of IETD, it also analyzes/computes IETD values through three methods: autocorrelation analysis, the
  average annual number of events analysis, and coefficient of variation analysis. Ideal for analyzing the sensitivity
  of IETD to characteristics of independent rainfall events.
