title: A Test Environment for HTTP Requests
maintainer: Neal Richardson
description: |-
  Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote servers
  can be painful. Dealing with authentication, server state,
  and other complications can make testing seem too costly to
  bother with. But it doesn't need to be that hard. This package enables one
  to test all of the logic on the R sides of the API in your package without
  requiring access to the remote service. Importantly, it provides three
  contexts that mock the network connection in different ways, as well as
  testing functions to assert that HTTP requests were---or were
  not---made. It also allows one to safely record real API responses to use as
  test fixtures. The ability to save responses and load them offline also
  enables one to write vignettes and other dynamic documents that can be
  distributed without access to a live server.
