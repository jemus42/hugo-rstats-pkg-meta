title: Open Perimetry Interface
maintainer: Andrew Turpin
description: 'Implementation of the Open Perimetry Interface (OPI) for simulating
  and controlling visual field machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing
  with visual field testing machines (perimeters). It specifies basic functions that
  allow many visual field tests to be constructed. As of October 2017 it is fully
  implemented on the Octopus 900 and partially on the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter, the
  Kowa AP 7000, the CrewT imo and the Centervue Compass. It also has a cousin: the
  R package ''visualFields'', which has tools for analysing and manipulating visual
  field data.'
