  Learning Interactions via Hierarchical Group-Lasso
  Regularization
maintainer: Michael Lim
description: 'Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET. Fits linear pairwise-interaction models
  that satisfy strong hierarchy: if an interaction coefficient is estimated to be
  nonzero, then its two associated main effects also have nonzero estimated coefficients.
  Accommodates categorical variables (factors) with arbitrary numbers of levels, continuous
  variables, and combinations thereof. Implements the machinery described in the paper
  "Learning interactions via hierarchical group-lasso regularization" (JCGS 2015,
  Volume 24, Issue 3). Michael Lim & Trevor Hastie (2015) <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2014.938812>.'
