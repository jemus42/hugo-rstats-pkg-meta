  Comprehensive Automatized Evaluation of Distribution Models for
  Count Data
maintainer: Jaroslaw Chilimoniuk
description: A large number of measurements generate count data. This is a statistical
  data type that only assumes non-negative integer values and is generated by counting.
  Typically, counting data can be found in biomedical applications, such as the analysis
  of DNA double-strand breaks. The number of DNA double-strand breaks can be counted
  in individual cells using various bioanalytical methods. For diagnostic applications,
  it is relevant to record the distribution of the number data in order to determine
  their biomedical significance (Roediger, S. et al., 2018. Journal of Laboratory
  and Precision Medicine. <doi:10.21037/jlpm.2018.04.10>). The software offers functions
  for a comprehensive automated evaluation of distribution models of count data. In
  addition to programmatic interaction, a graphical user interface (web server) is
  included, which enables fast and interactive data-scientific analyses. The user
  is supported in selecting the most suitable counting distribution for his own data
  set.
