description: |-
  Functions to compute the Generalized Dynamic Principal Components
  introduced in Peña and Yohai (2016) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2015.1072542>. The implementation
  includes an automatic procedure proposed in Peña, Smucler and Yohai (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v092.c02>
  for the identification of both the number of lags to be used
  in the generalized dynamic principal components as well as the number of components required
  for a given reconstruction accuracy.
