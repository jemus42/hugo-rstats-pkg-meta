description: |-
  The strength of evidence provided by epidemiological and observational
  studies is inherently limited by the potential for unmeasured confounding.
  We focus on three key quantities: the observed bound of the confidence interval
  closest to the null, a plausible residual effect size for an unmeasured continuous
  or binary confounder, and a realistic mean difference or prevalence difference for
  this hypothetical confounder. Building on the methods put forth by
  Lin, Psaty, & Kronmal (1998) <doi:10.2307/2533848>, we can use these quantities to
  assess how an unmeasured confounder may tip our result to insignificance, rendering the
  study inconclusive.
