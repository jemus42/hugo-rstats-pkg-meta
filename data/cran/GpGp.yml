title: Fast Gaussian Process Computation Using Vecchia's Approximation
maintainer: Joseph Guinness
description: |-
  Functions for fitting and doing predictions with
  Gaussian process models using Vecchia's (1988) approximation.
  Package also includes functions for reordering input locations,
  finding ordered nearest neighbors (with help from 'FNN' package),
  grouping operations, and conditional simulations.
  Covariance functions for spatial and spatial-temporal data
  on Euclidean domains and spheres are provided. The original
  approximation is due to Vecchia (1988)
  <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345768>, and the reordering and
  grouping methods are from Guinness (2018)
  <doi:10.1080/00401706.2018.1437476>.
  Model fitting employs a Fisher scoring algorithm described
  in Guinness (2019) <arXiv:1905.08374>.
