version: 2.0.0
title: The Pareto and the Piecewise Pareto Distribution
maintainer: Ulrich Riegel
description: |-
  Utilities for the Pareto and piecewise Pareto distribution
  that are useful for reinsurance pricing. In particular, the package provides
  a non-trivial algorithm that can be used to match the expected losses of a
  tower of reinsurance layers with a layer-independent collective risk model.
  The theoretical background of the matching algorithm and most other methods
  are described in Ulrich Riegel (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13385-018-0177-3>.
