title: Linear Inverse Model examples and solution methods.
maintainer: Karline Soetaert
description: |-
  Functions that read and solve linear inverse problems (food web problems, linear programming problems).
  These problems find solutions to linear or quadratic functions:
  min or max (f(x)), where f(x) = ||Ax-b||^2 or f(x) = sum(ai*xi)
  subject to equality constraints Ex=f and inequality constraints Gx>=h. Uses package limSolve.
