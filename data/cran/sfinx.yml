title: Straightforward Filtering Index for AP-MS Data Analysis (SFINX)
maintainer: Kevin Titeca
description: |-
  The straightforward filtering index (SFINX) identifies true positive
  protein interactions in a fast, user-friendly, and highly accurate way.
  It is not only useful for the filtering of affinity purification -
  mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data, but also for similar types of data
  resulting from other co-complex interactomics technologies, such as TAP-MS,
  Virotrap and BioID. SFINX can also be used via the website interface at
  <http://sfinx.ugent.be>.
