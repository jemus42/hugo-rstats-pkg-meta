  Analysis
maintainer: Miao YU
description: Paired mass distance (PMD) analysis proposed in Yu, Olkowicz and Pawliszyn
  (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062> for gas/liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry
  (GC/LC-MS) based non-targeted analysis. PMD analysis including GlobalStd algorithm
  and structure/reaction directed analysis. GlobalStd algorithm could found independent
  peaks in m/z-retention time profiles based on retention time hierarchical cluster
  analysis and frequency analysis of paired mass distances within retention time groups.
  Structure directed analysis could be used to find potential relationship among those
  independent peaks in different retention time groups based on frequency of paired
  mass distances. A GUI for PMD analysis is also included as a 'shiny' application.
