title: Disparity Filter Algorithm for Weighted Networks
maintainer: Alessandro Bessi
description: |-
  The disparity filter algorithm is a network reduction technique to
  identify the 'backbone' structure of a weighted network without destroying
  its multi-scale nature. The algorithm is documented in M. Angeles Serrano,
  Marian Boguna and Alessandro Vespignani in "Extracting the multiscale
  backbone of complex weighted networks", Proceedings of the National Academy
  of Sciences 106 (16), 2009. This implementation of the algorithm supports
  both directed and undirected networks.
