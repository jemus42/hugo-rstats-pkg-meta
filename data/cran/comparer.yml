title: Compare Output and Run Time
maintainer: Collin Erickson
description: |-
  Quickly run experiments to compare the run time and output of
  code blocks. The function mbc() can make fast comparisons of code,
  and will calculate statistics comparing the resulting outputs.
  It can be used to compare model fits to the same data or
  see which function runs faster.
  The function ffexp() runs a function using all possible combinations
  of selected inputs. This is useful for comparing the effect of
  different parameter values. It can also run in parallel and
  automatically save intermediate results, which is very useful
  for long computations.
