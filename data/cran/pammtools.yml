  The Piece-wise exponential (Additive Mixed) Model
  (PAMM; Bender and Scheipl (2018) <doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083>) is a
  powerful model class for the analysis of survival (or time-to-event) data,
  based on Generalized Additive (Mixed) Models (GA(M)Ms). It offers intuitive specification and robust estimation of complex survival models with stratified baseline hazards, random effects, time-varying effects, time-dependent covariates and cumulative effects (Bender and others (2018) <doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003>.
  pammtools provides tidy workflow for survival analysis with PAMMs,
  including data simulation, transformation and other functions for data
  preprocessing and model post-processing as well as visualization.
