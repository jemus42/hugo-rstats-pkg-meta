title: Insert and Extract "Reminders" from Function Comments
maintainer: Bert Gunter
description: |-
  Insert/extract text "reminders" into/from function source code
  comments or as the "comment" attribute of any object.
  The former can be handy in development as reminders of e.g. argument
  requirements, expected objects in the calling environment, required options
  settings, etc. The latter can be used to provide information of the object and
  as simple manual "tooltips" for users, among other things.
