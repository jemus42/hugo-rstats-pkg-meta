  introduced 'WhiteStripe', an intensity-based normalization of T1
  and T2 images, where normal
  appearing white matter performs well, but requires segmentation.
  This method performs white matter mean and standard deviation
  estimates on data that has been rigidly-registered to the 'MNI'
  template and uses histogram-based methods.
