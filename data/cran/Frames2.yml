title: Estimation in Dual Frame Surveys
maintainer: David Molina
description: |-
  Point and interval estimation in dual frame surveys. In contrast
  to classic sampling theory, where only one sampling frame is considered,
  dual frame methodology assumes that there are two frames available for
  sampling and that, overall, they cover the entire target population. Then,
  two probability samples (one from each frame) are drawn and information
  collected is suitably combined to get estimators of the parameter of
  interest.
