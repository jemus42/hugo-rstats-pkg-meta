description: |-
  Functions to compute the one-sided dynamic
  principal components ('odpc') introduced in Smucler, Pe√±a and Yohai (2018)
  <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1520117>. 'odpc' is a novel dimension
  reduction technique for multivariate time series, that is useful
  for forecasting. These dynamic principal components are defined as
  the linear combinations of the present and past values of the series
  that minimize the reconstruction mean squared error.
