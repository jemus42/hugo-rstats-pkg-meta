title: Scalable Gaussian-Process Approximations
maintainer: Marcin Jurek
description: Fast scalable Gaussian process approximations, particularly well suited
  to spatial (aerial, remote-sensed) and environmental data, described in more detail
  in Katzfuss and Guinness (2017) <arXiv:1708.06302>. Package also contains a fast
  implementation of the incomplete Cholesky decomposition (IC0), based on Schaefer
  et al. (2019) <arXiv:1706.02205> and MaxMin ordering proposed in Guinness (2018)
  <arXiv:1609.05372>.
