title: Make Static HTML Website for Predictive Models
maintainer: Kamil Romaszko
description: |-
  Website generator with HTML summaries for predictive models.
  This package uses 'DALEX' explainers to describe global model behavior.
  We can see how well models behave (tabs: Model Performance, Auditor),
  how much each variable contributes to predictions (tabs: Variable Response)
  and which variables are the most important for a given model (tabs: Variable Importance).
  We can also compare Concept Drift for pairs of models (tabs: Drifter).
  Additionally, data available on the website can be easily recreated in current R session.
  Work on this package was financially supported by the NCN Opus grant 2017/27/B/ST6/01307
  at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science.
