title: Managing Animal Movement Data with 'PostGIS' and R
maintainer: Bal√°zs Dukai
description: |-
  Integrates R and the 'PostgreSQL/PostGIS' database
  system to build and manage animal trajectory (movement) data sets.
  The package relies on 'ltraj' objects from the R package 'adehabitatLT',
  building the analogous 'pgtraj' data structure in 'PostGIS'. Functions
  allow users to seamlessly transfer between 'ltraj' and 'pgtraj', as
  well as build new 'pgtraj' directly from location data stored in the
  database.
