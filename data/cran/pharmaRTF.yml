title: Enhanced RTF Wrapper for Use with Existing Table Packages
maintainer: Michael Stackhouse
description: |-
  Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables
  packages such as 'Huxtable' or 'GT'. This package fills a gap where tables in
  certain packages can be written out to RTF, but cannot add certain metadata
  or features to the document that are required/expected in a report for a
  regulatory submission, such as multiple levels of titles and footnotes,
  making the document landscape, and controlling properties such as margins.
