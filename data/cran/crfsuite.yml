  Conditional Random Fields for Labelling Sequential Data in
  Natural Language Processing
maintainer: Jan Wijffels
description: |-
  Wraps the 'CRFsuite' library <https://github.com/chokkan/crfsuite> allowing users
  to fit a Conditional Random Field model and to apply it on existing data.
  The focus of the implementation is in the area of Natural Language Processing where this R package allows you to easily build and apply models
  for named entity recognition, text chunking, part of speech tagging, intent recognition or classification of any category you have in mind. Next to training, a small web application
  is included in the package to allow you to easily construct training data.
