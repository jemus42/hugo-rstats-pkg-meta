title: Implementation of SparseMDC Algorithm
maintainer: Jun Li
description: |-
  Implements the algorithm described in
  Barron, M., and Li, J. (Not yet published). This algorithm clusters
  samples from multiple ordered populations, links the clusters across the
  conditions and identifies marker genes for these changes. The package was
  designed for scRNA-Seq data but is also applicable to many other data
  types, just replace cells with samples and genes with variables. The
  package also contains functions for estimating the parameters for SparseMDC
  as outlined in the paper. We recommend that users further select their
  marker genes using the magnitude of the cluster centers.
