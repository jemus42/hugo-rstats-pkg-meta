  Smoothing of Two-Dimensional Demographic Data, Optionally Taking
  into Account Period and Cohort Effects
maintainer: Alexander Dokumentov
description: |-
  The implemented method uses for smoothing bivariate thin plate
  splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period
  and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four
  components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional
  cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors.
