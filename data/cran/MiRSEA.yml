title: '''MicroRNA'' Set Enrichment Analysis'
maintainer: Junwei Han
description: The tools for 'MicroRNA Set Enrichment Analysis' can identify risk pathways(or
  prior gene sets) regulated by microRNA set in the context of microRNA expression
  data. (1) This package constructs a correlation profile of microRNA and pathways
  by the hypergeometric statistic test. The gene sets of pathways derived from the
  three public databases (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ('KEGG'); 'Reactome';
  'Biocarta') and the target gene sets of microRNA are provided by four databases('TarBaseV6.0';
  'mir2Disease'; 'miRecords'; 'miRTarBase';). (2) This package can quantify the change
  of correlation between microRNA for each pathway(or prior gene set) based on a microRNA
  expression data with cases and controls. (3) This package uses the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  statistic to calculate an enrichment score (ES) of a microRNA set that co-regulate
  to a pathway , which reflects the degree to which a given pathway is associated
  with the specific phenotype. (4) This package can provide the visualization of the
  results.
