title: Analysis of Simulation Studies Including Monte Carlo Error
maintainer: Alessandro Gasparini
description: |-
  Summarise results from simulation studies and compute Monte Carlo
  standard errors of commonly used summary statistics. This package is modelled
  on the 'simsum' user-written command in 'Stata' (White I.R., 2010
  <http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0200>), further extending
  it with additional functionality.
