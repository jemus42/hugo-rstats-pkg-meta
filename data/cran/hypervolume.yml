  High Dimensional Geometry and Set Operations Using Kernel
  Density Estimation, Support Vector Machines, and Convex Hulls
maintainer: Benjamin Blonder
description: 'Estimates the shape and volume of high-dimensional datasets and performs
  set operations: intersection / overlap, union, unique components, inclusion test,
  and hole detection. Uses stochastic geometry approach to high-dimensional kernel
  density estimation, support vector machine delineation, and convex hull generation.
  Applications include modeling trait and niche hypervolumes and species distribution
  modeling.'
