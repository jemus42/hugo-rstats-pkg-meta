maintainer: Steven T. Garren
description: Provides functionality to produce graphs of probability density functions
  and cumulative distribution functions with few keystrokes, allows shading under
  the curve of the probability density function to illustrate concepts such as p-values
  and critical values, and fits a simple linear regression line on a scatter plot
