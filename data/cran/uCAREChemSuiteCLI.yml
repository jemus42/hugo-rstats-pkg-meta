title: Resistome Predicter
maintainer: Saurav Bhaskar Saha
description: This suite of packages is developed to predicts resistome for unknown
  chemical compounds. It utilizes two algorithms viz. deterministic model and stochastic
  model (manuscript under preparation) for the prediction of drug class. Once the
  drug class is predicted, the resistome profile of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa for the drug class is fetched from the database.
