title: Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures
maintainer: Yalin Zhu
description: |-
  Several generalized / directional Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing
  Procedures (FSMTPs) are developed for testing a sequence of pre-ordered
  hypotheses while controlling the FWER, FDR and Directional Error (mdFWER).
  All three FWER controlling generalized FSMTPs are designed under arbitrary
  dependence, which allow any number of acceptances. Two FDR controlling
  generalized FSMTPs are respectively designed under arbitrary dependence and
  independence, which allow more but a given number of acceptances. Two mdFWER
  controlling directional FSMTPs are respectively designed under arbitrary
  dependence and independence, which can also make directional decisions based
  on the signs of the test statistics. The main functions for each proposed
  generalized / directional FSMTPs are designed to calculate adjusted p-values
  and critical values, respectively. For users' convenience, the functions also
  provide the output option for printing decision rules.
