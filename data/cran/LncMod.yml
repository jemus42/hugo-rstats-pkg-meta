description: |-
  Predict modulators regulating the ability of effectors to regulate their targets and produce
  modulator-effector-target triplets followed by goterm functional enrichment and survival analysis.This
  is mainly applied to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as candidate modulators regulating the ability of
  transcription factors (TFs) to regulate their corresponding targets.
