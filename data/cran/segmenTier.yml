title: Similarity-Based Segmentation of Multidimensional Signals
maintainer: Rainer Machne
description: |-
  A dynamic programming solution to segmentation based on
  maximization of arbitrary similarity measures within segments.
  The general idea, theory and this implementation are described in
  Machne, Murray & Stadler (2017) <doi:10.1038/s41598-017-12401-8>.
  In addition to the core algorithm, the package provides time-series
  processing and clustering functions as described in the publication.
  These are generally applicable where a `k-means` clustering yields
  meaningful results, and have been specifically developed for
  clustering of the Discrete Fourier Transform of periodic gene
  expression data (`circadian' or `yeast metabolic oscillations').
  This clustering approach is outlined in the supplemental material of
  Machne & Murray (2012) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037906>), and here
  is used as a basis of segment similarity measures. Notably, the
  time-series processing and clustering functions can also be used as
  stand-alone tools, independent of segmentation, e.g., for
  transcriptome data already mapped to genes.
