title: Implementation of 2D Correlation Analysis in R
maintainer: Robert Geitner
description: |-
  Implementation of two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis based
  on the Fourier-transformation approach described by Isao Noda (I. Noda
  (1993) <DOI:10.1366/0003702934067694>). Additionally there are two plot
  functions for the resulting correlation matrix: The first one creates
  colored 2D plots, while the second one generates 3D plots.
