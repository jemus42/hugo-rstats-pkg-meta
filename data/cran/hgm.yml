title: Holonomic Gradient Method and Gradient Descent
maintainer: Nobuki Takayama
description: |-
  The holonomic gradient method (HGM, hgm) gives a way to evaluate normalization
  constants of unnormalized probability distributions by utilizing holonomic
  systems of differential or difference equations. The holonomic gradient descent (HGD, hgd) gives a method
  to find maximal likelihood estimates by utilizing the HGM.
