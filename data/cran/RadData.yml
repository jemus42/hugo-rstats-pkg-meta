  This is a database of the physical data needed in calculations of
  radionuclide-specific protection and operational quantities. The
  data is prescribed by the ICRP, the international authority on
  radiation dose standards, for estimating dose from the intake of or
  exposure to radionuclides in the workplace and the environment.
  The database contains information on the half-lives, decay chains,
  and yields and energies of radiations emitted in nuclear transformations
  of 1252 radionuclides of 97 elements.
