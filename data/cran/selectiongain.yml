  A Tool for Calculation and Optimization of the Expected Gain
  from Multi-Stage Selection
maintainer: Xuefei Mi
description: Multi-stage selection is practiced in numerous fields of life and social
  sciences and particularly in breeding. A special characteristic of multi-stage selection
  is that candidates are evaluated in successive stages with increasing intensity
  and effort, and only a fraction of the superior candidates is selected and promoted
  to the next stage. For the optimum design of such selection programs, the selection
  gain plays a crucial role. It can be calculated by integration of a truncated multivariate
  normal (MVN) distribution. While mathematical formulas for calculating the selection
  gain and the variance among selected candidates were developed long time ago, solutions
  for numerical calculation were not available. This package can also be used for
  optimizing multi-stage selection programs for a given total budget and different
  costs of evaluating the candidates in each stage.
