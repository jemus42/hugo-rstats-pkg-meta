  A data smoothing approach to explore and test gene-environment
  interaction in case-parent trio data
maintainer: Ji-Hyung Shin
description: |-
  The package contains functions that 1) estimates
  gene-environment interaction between a SNP and a continuous
  non-genetic attribute by fitting a generalized additive model
  to case-parent trio data, 2) produces graphical displays of
  estimated interaction, 3) performs permutation test of
  gene-environment interaction; 4) simulates informative
  case-parent trios.
