title: Spatially Varying Change Points
maintainer: Samuel I. Berchuck
description: |-
  Implements a spatially varying change point model with
  unique intercepts, slopes, variance intercepts and slopes, and
  change points at each location. Inference is within the
  Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The
  response variable can be modeled as Gaussian (no nugget),
  probit or Tobit link and the five spatially varying parameter
  are modeled jointly using a multivariate conditional
  autoregressive (MCAR) prior. The MCAR is a unique process that
  allows for a dissimilarity metric to dictate the local spatial
  dependencies. Full details of the package can be found in the accompanying vignette.
  Furthermore, the details of the package can be found in the corresponding paper on arXiv
  by Berchuck et al (2018): "A spatially varying change points model for monitoring glaucoma
  progression using visual field data", <arXiv:1811.11038>.
