title: Covariance Matrix Estimation and Regularization for Finance
maintainer: YaChen Yan
description: |-
  Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset
  returns. For covariance matrix estimation, three major types of factor
  models are included: macroeconomic factor model, fundamental factor model and
  statistical factor model. For covariance matrix regularization, four regularized
  estimators are included: banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-
  thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized estimators are selected
  via cross-validation.
