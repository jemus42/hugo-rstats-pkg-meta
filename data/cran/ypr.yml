title: Yield Per Recruit
maintainer: Joe Thorley
description: |-
  An implementation of equilibrium-based yield per recruit methods.
  Yield per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal yield for a fish population
  as described by Walters and Martell (2004) <isbn:0-691-11544-3>.
  The yield can be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or
  biomass caught for all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.
