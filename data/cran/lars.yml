title: Least Angle Regression, Lasso and Forward Stagewise
maintainer: Trevor Hastie
description: Efficient procedures for fitting an entire lasso sequence<U+000a>with
  the cost of a single least squares fit. Least angle<U+000a>regression and infinitesimal
  forward stagewise regression are<U+000a>related to the lasso, as described in the
  paper below.
