  Configurable Function for Solving Families of Nonlinear
  Equations
maintainer: Carl Witthoft
description: |-
  This is designed for use with an arbitrary set of equations with
  an arbitrary set of unknowns.
  The user selects "fixed" values for enough unknowns to leave as many variables as
  there are equations, which in most cases means the system is properly
  defined and a unique solution exists. The function, the fixed values
  and initial values for the remaining unknowns are fed to a nonlinear backsolver.
  The original version of "TK!Solver" , now a product of Universal Technical Systems (<https://www.uts.com>) was the inspiration for this function.
