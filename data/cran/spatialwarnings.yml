title: Spatial Early Warning Signals of Ecosystem Degradation
maintainer: Alexandre Genin
description: Tools to compute and assess significance of early-warnings signals (EWS)
  of ecosystem degradation on raster data sets. EWS are metrics derived from the observed
  spatial structure of an ecosystem -- e.g. spatial autocorrelation -- that increase
  before an ecosystem undergoes a non-linear transition (Genin et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13058>).
