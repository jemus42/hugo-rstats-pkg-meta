title: Multivariate Fay Herriot Models for Small Area Estimation
maintainer: Novia Permatasari
description: Implements multivariate Fay-Herriot models for small area estimation.
  It uses empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator. Multivariate
  models consider the correlation of several target variables and borrow strength
  from auxiliary variables to improve the effectiveness of a domain sample size. Models
  which accommodated by this package are univariate model with several target variables
  (model 0), multivariate model (model 1), autoregressive multivariate model (model
  2), and heteroscedastic autoregressive multivariate model (model 3). Functions provide
  EBLUP estimators and mean squared error (MSE) estimator for each model. These models
  were developed by Roberto Benavent and Domingo Morales (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.013>.
