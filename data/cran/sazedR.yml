  Spectral and Average Autocorrelation Zero Distance Density
  ('sazed') is a method for estimating the season length of a
  seasonal time series. 'sazed' is aimed at practitioners, as it employs only
  domain-agnostic preprocessing and does not depend on parameter tuning or
  empirical constants. The computation of 'sazed' relies on the efficient
  autocorrelation computation methods suggested by Thibauld Nion (2012, URL:
  <http://www.tibonihoo.net/literate_musing/autocorrelations.html>) and by
  Bob Carpenter (2012, URL:
