title: Estimation of Life Expectancies Using Multi-State Models
maintainer: Ardo van den Hout
description: Functions to compute state-specific and marginal life expectancies. The
  computation is based on a fitted continuous-time multi-state model that includes
  an absorbing death state; see Van den Hout (2017, ISBN:9781466568402). The fitted
  multi-state model model should be estimated using the 'msm' package using age as
  the time-scale.
