title: Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) with 'Stan'
maintainer: Eric J. Ward
description: |-
  Implements Bayesian dynamic factor analysis with 'Stan'. Dynamic
  factor analysis is a dimension reduction tool for multivariate time series.
  'bayesdfa' extends conventional dynamic factor models in several ways.
  First, extreme events may be estimated in the latent trend by modeling
  process error with a student-t distribution. Second, autoregressive and
  moving average components can be optionally included. Third, the estimated
  dynamic factors can be analyzed with hidden Markov models to evaluate
  support for latent regimes.
