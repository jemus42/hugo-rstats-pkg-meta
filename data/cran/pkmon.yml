  Least-Squares Estimator under k-Monotony Constraint for Discrete
  Functions
maintainer: Francois Deslandes
description: We implement two least-squares estimators under k-monotony constraint
  using a method based on the Support Reduction Algorithm from Groeneboom et al (2008)
  <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2007.00588.x>. The first one is a projection estimator
  on the set of k-monotone discrete functions. The second one is a projection on the
  set of k-monotone discrete probabilities. This package provides functions to generate
  samples from the spline basis from Lefevre and Loisel (2013) <DOI:10.1239/jap/1378401239>,
  and from mixtures of splines.
