  Spatio-Temporal Estimation and Prediction for Censored/Missing
  Responses
maintainer: Larissa Avila Matos
description: It estimates the parameters of a censored or missing data in spatio-temporal
  models using the SAEM algorithm (Delyon et al., 1999 <doi:10.1214/aos/1018031103>).
  This algorithm is a stochastic approximation of the widely used EM algorithm and
  an important tool for models in which the E-step does not have an analytic form.
  Besides the expressions obtained to estimate the parameters to the proposed model,
  we include the calculations for the observed information matrix using the method
  developed by Louis (1982) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345828>. To examine the
  performance of the fitted model, case-deletion measure are provided.
