  Improved Communication to Users with Respect to Problems in
  Function Arguments
maintainer: Benjamin Nutter
description: |-
  The typical process of checking arguments in functions is
  iterative.  In this process, an error may be returned and the user may fix
  it only to receive another error on a different argument.  'ArgumentCheck'
  facilitates a more helpful way to perform argument checks allowing the
  programmer to run all of the checks and then return all of the errors and
  warnings in a single message.
