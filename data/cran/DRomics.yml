title: Dose Response for Omics
maintainer: Aurelie Siberchicot
description: Several functions are provided for dose-response (or concentration-response)
  characterization from omics data. 'DRomics' is especially dedicated to omics data
  obtained using a typical dose-response design, favoring a great number of tested
  doses (or concentrations, at least 5, and the more the better) rather than a great
  number of replicates (no need of three replicates). 'DRomics' provides functions
  1) to check, normalize and or transform data, 2) to select monotonic or biphasic
  significantly responding items (e.g. probes, metabolites), 3) to choose the best-fit
  model among a predefined family of monotonic and biphasic models to describe each
  selected item 4) to derive a benchmark dose or concentration and a typology of response
  from each fitted curve. In the available version data are supposed to be single-channel
  microarray data in log2, RNAseq data in raw counts or already pretreated metabolomic
  data in log scale. For further details see Larras et al (2018) <DOI:10.1021/acs.est.8b04752>.
