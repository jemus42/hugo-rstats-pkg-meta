title: A Hybrid Filter-Wrapper Feature Selection Method
maintainer: Yamini Pandari
description: A hybrid method of feature selection which combines both filter and wrapper
  methods. The first level involves feature reduction based on some of the important
  filter methods while the second level involves feature subset selection as in a
  wrapper method. Comparative analysis with the existing feature selection packages
  shows this package results in higher classification accuracy, reduced processing
  time and improved data handling capacity.
