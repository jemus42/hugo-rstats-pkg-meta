description: |-
  Support vector machines (SVMs) and related kernel-based learning
  algorithms are a well-known class of machine learning algorithms, for
  non-parametric classification and regression.
  liquidSVM is an implementation of SVMs whose key features are:
  fully integrated hyper-parameter selection,
  extreme speed on both small and large data sets,
  full flexibility for experts, and
  inclusion of a variety of different learning scenarios:
  multi-class classification, ROC, and Neyman-Pearson learning, and
  least-squares, quantile, and expectile regression.
