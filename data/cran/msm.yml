title: Multi-State Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time
maintainer: Christopher Jackson
description: |-
  Functions for fitting continuous-time Markov and hidden
  Markov multi-state models to longitudinal data.  Designed for
  processes observed at arbitrary times in continuous time (panel data)
  but some other observation schemes are supported. Both Markov
  transition rates and the hidden Markov output process can be modelled
  in terms of covariates, which may be constant or piecewise-constant
  in time.
