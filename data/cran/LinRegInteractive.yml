title: Interactive Interpretation of Linear Regression Models
maintainer: Martin Meermeyer
description: |-
  Interactive visualization of effects, response functions
  and marginal effects for different kinds of regression models. In this version
  linear regression models, generalized linear models, generalized additive
  models and linear mixed-effects models are supported.
  Major features are the interactive approach and the handling of the effects of categorical covariates:
  if two or more factors are used as covariates every combination of the levels of each
  factor is treated separately. The automatic calculation of
  marginal effects and a number of possibilities to customize the graphical output
  are useful features as well.
