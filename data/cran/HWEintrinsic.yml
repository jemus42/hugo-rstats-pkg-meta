  Objective Bayesian Testing for the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
  Problem
maintainer: Sergio Venturini
description: General (multi-allelic) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem from an objective
  Bayesian testing standpoint. This aim is achieved through the identification of
  a class of priors specifically designed for this testing problem. A class of intrinsic
  priors under the full model is considered. This class is indexed by a tuning quantity,
  the training sample size, as discussed in Consonni, Moreno and Venturini (2010).
  These priors are objective, satisfy Savage's continuity condition and have proved
  to behave extremely well for many statistical testing problems.
