title: Logging Events in Shiny Apps
maintainer: Kamil Wais
description: |-
  Logging framework dedicated for complex shiny apps.
  Different types of events can be logged
  (value of a variable, multi-line output of a function,
  result of a unit test, custom error, warning, or diagnostic message).
  Each event can be logged with a list of parameters that are event-specific,
  common for events within the same scope, session-specific, or app-wide.
  Logging can be done simultaneously to R console,
  browser JavaScript console, a file log, and a database (MongoDB).
  Log data can be further analyzed with the help of process-mining techniques
  from 'bupaR' package.
