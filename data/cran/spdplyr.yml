title: Data Manipulation Verbs for the Spatial Classes
maintainer: Michael D. Sumner
description: |-
  Methods for 'dplyr' verbs for 'sp' 'Spatial' classes. The basic
  verbs that modify data attributes, remove or re-arrange rows are supported
  and provide complete 'Spatial' analogues of the input data. The group by
  and summarize work flow returns a non-topological spatial union. There is
  limited support for joins, with left and inner to copy attributes from
  another table.
