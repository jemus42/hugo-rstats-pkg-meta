  Wrapper for 'FFTW3' Includes: One-Dimensional Univariate,
  One-Dimensional Multivariate, and Two-Dimensional Transform
maintainer: Karim Rahim
description: Provides a wrapper for several 'FFTW' functions. This package provides
  access to the two-dimensional 'FFT', the multivariate 'FFT', and the one-dimensional
  real to complex 'FFT' using the 'FFTW3' library. The package includes the functions
  fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions
  fft() and mvfft(). The 'FFT' functions have a parameter that allows them to not
  return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is real data.
