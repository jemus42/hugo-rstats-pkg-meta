title: Covariate-Adaptive Randomization for Clinical Trials
maintainer: Xiaoqing Ye
description: Provides functions and command-line user interface to generate allocation
  sequence by covariate-adaptive randomization for clinical trials. The package currently
  supports six covariate-adaptive randomization procedures. Three hypothesis testing
  methods that are valid and robust under covariate-adaptive randomization are also
  available in the package to facilitate the inference for treatment effect under
  the included randomization procedures. Additionally, the package provides comprehensive
  and efficient tools to allow one to evaluate and compare the performance of randomization
  procedures and tests based on various criteria.
