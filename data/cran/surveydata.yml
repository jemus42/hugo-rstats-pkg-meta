title: Tools to Work with Survey Data
maintainer: Andrie de Vries
description: |-
  Data obtained from surveys contains information not only about the
  survey responses, but also the survey metadata, e.g. the original survey
  questions and the answer options. The 'surveydata' package makes it easy to
  keep track of this metadata, and to easily extract columns with
  specific questions.
