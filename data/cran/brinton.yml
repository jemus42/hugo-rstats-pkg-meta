description: |-
  An automated graphical exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool that introduces:
  a.) wideplot() graphics for exploring the structure of a dataset through a grid of variables
  and graphic types.
  b.) longplot() graphics, which present the entire catalog of available graphics for representing
  a particular variable using a grid of graphic types and variations on these types.
  c.) plotup() function, which presents a particular graphic for a specific variable of a dataset.
  The plotup() function also makes it possible to obtain the code used to generate the graphic,
  meaning that the user can adjust its properties as needed.
