title: Classification with Matrix Variate Normal and t Distributions
maintainer: Geoffrey Thompson
description: |-
  Provides sampling and density functions for matrix
  variate normal, t, and inverted t distributions;  ML estimation for matrix
  variate normal and t distributions using the EM algorithm,
  including some restrictions on the parameters; and classification by linear and
  quadratic discriminant analysis for matrix variate normal and t
  distributions described in Thompson et al. (2019) <arXiv:1907.09565>.
  Performs clustering with matrix variate normal and t mixture models.
