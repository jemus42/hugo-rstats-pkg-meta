description: |-
  'BEAST2' (<https://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2', 'Tracer' and 'DensiTree'.
  'babette' provides for an alternative workflow of using
  all these tools separately. This allows doing complex Bayesian
  phylogenetics easily and reproducibly from 'R'.
