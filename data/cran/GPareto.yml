title: Gaussian Processes for Pareto Front Estimation and Optimization
maintainer: Mickael Binois
description: |-
  Gaussian process regression models, a.k.a. Kriging models, are
  applied to global multi-objective optimization of black-box functions.
  Multi-objective Expected Improvement and Step-wise Uncertainty Reduction
  sequential infill criteria are available. A quantification of uncertainty
  on Pareto fronts is provided using conditional simulations.
