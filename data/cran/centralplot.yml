  Show the Strength of Relationships Between Centre and Peripheral
  Items
maintainer: Jian Sun
description: The degree of correlation between centre and peripheral items are shown
  by the length of the line between them. You can self-define the length by inputing
  the "distance" parameter. For example, you can input (1 - Pearson's correlation
  coefficient) as "distance" so that the stronger the correlation between centre and
  peripheral item, the nearer they will be in this plot. Also, If you do a hypothesis
  test and the null hypothesis is centre and peripheral items are the same, you can
  input -log(P) as distance. To sum up, the stronger the correlation between centre
  and peripheral is, the smaller the "distance" parameter should be. Due to its high
  degree of freedom, it can be applied to many different circumstance.
