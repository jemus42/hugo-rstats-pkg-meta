  A Modular, Integrated Approach to Maximum Entropy Distribution
  Modeling
maintainer: Julien Vollering
description: |-
  Tools for training, selecting, and evaluating maximum entropy
  (and standard logistic regression) distribution models. This package
  provides tools for user-controlled transformation of explanatory variables,
  selection of variables by nested model comparison, and flexible model
  evaluation and projection. It follows principles based on the maximum-
  likelihood interpretation of maximum entropy modeling, and uses infinitely-
  weighted logistic regression for model fitting.
