  Identifying Master Gene Regulators from Gene Expression and
  DNA-Binding Data
maintainer: Juri Reimand
description: 'The method ''m:Explorer'' associates a given list of target genes (e.g.
  those involved in a biological process) to gene regulators such as transcription
  factors. Transcription factors that bind DNA near significantly many target genes
  or correlate with target genes in transcriptional (microarray or RNAseq data) are
  selected. Selection of candidate master regulators is carried out using multinomial
  regression models, likelihood ratio tests and multiple testing correction. Reference:
