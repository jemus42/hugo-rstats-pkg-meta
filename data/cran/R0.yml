  Estimation of R0 and Real-Time Reproduction Number from
  Epidemics
maintainer: Thomas Obadia
description: |-
  Estimation of reproduction numbers for disease outbreak, based on
  incidence data. The R0 package implements several documented methods. It is
  therefore possible to compare estimations according to the methods used.
  Depending on the methods requested by user, basic reproduction number
  (commonly denoted as R0) or real-time reproduction number (referred to as
  R(t)) is computed, along with a 95% Confidence Interval. Plotting outputs
  will give different graphs depending on the methods requested : basic
  reproductive number estimations will only show the epidemic curve
  (collected data) and an adjusted model, whereas real-time methods will also
  show the R(t) variations throughout the outbreak time period. Sensitivity
  analysis tools are also provided, and allow for investigating effects of
  varying Generation Time distribution or time window on estimates.
