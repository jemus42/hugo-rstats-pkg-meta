  Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models in Population Pharmacokinetics
  and Pharmacodynamics
maintainer: Wenping Wang
description: |-
  Fit and compare nonlinear mixed-effects models in differential
  equations with flexible dosing information commonly seen in pharmacokinetics
  and pharmacodynamics (Almquist, Leander, and Jirstrand 2015
  <doi:10.1007/s10928-015-9409-1>). Differential equation solving is
  by compiled C code provided in the 'RxODE' package
  (Wang, Hallow, and James 2015 <doi:10.1002/psp4.12052>).
