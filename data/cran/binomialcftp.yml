title: Generates binomial random numbers via the coupling from the past<U+000a>algorithm
maintainer: Francisco Jureitg
description: Binomial random numbers are generated via the perfect<U+000a>sampling
  algorithm. At each iteration dual markov chains are<U+000a>generated and coalescence
  is checked. In case coalescence<U+000a>occurs, the resulting number is outputted.
  In case not, then<U+000a>the algorithm is restarted from T(t)=2*T(t) until coalescence<U+000a>occurs.
