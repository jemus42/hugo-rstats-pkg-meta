title: Simulating Spreading Activation in a Network
maintainer: Cynthia Siew
description: |-
  The notion of spreading activation is a prevalent metaphor in the cognitive sciences.
  This package provides the tools for cognitive scientists and psychologists to conduct computer simulations
  that implement spreading activation in a network representation. The algorithmic method implemented in 'spreadr'
  subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (2011, Frontiers),
  who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could spread among nodes that were connected to
  each other via edges or connections (i.e., a network). See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G., & Adagarla, B. (2011).
