title: Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing
maintainer: Sarah McGough
description: A Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported
  cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. 'NobBS'
  learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve
  to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings,
  as described in McGough et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/663823>.
