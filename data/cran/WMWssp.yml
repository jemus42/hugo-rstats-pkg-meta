title: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Sample Size Planning
maintainer: Martin Happ
description: |-
  Calculates the minimal sample size for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
  that is needed for a given power and two sided type I error rate. The method works for metric data with and without
  ties, count data, ordered categorical data, and even dichotomous data.
  But data is needed for the reference group to generate synthetic data for the treatment group based on a relevant effect.
