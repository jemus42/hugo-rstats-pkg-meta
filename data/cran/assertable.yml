  Verbose Assertions for Tabular Data (Data.frames and
  Data.tables)
maintainer: Grant Nguyen
description: Simple, flexible, assertions on data.frame or data.table objects with
  verbose output for vetting. While other assertion packages apply towards more general
  use-cases, assertable is tailored towards tabular data. It includes functions to
  check variable names and values, whether the dataset contains all combinations of
  a given set of unique identifiers, and whether it is a certain length. In addition,
  assertable includes utility functions to check the existence of target files and
  to efficiently import multiple tabular data files into one data.table.
