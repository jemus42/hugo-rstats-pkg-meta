  Analysis of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Massively Parallel
  Sequencing (MPS) Data
maintainer: SÃ¸ren B. Vilsen
description: Loading, identifying, aggregating, manipulating, and analysing short
  tandem repeat regions of massively parallel sequencing data in forensic genetics.
  'STRMPS' can work with the package 'STRaitRazoR' (an R interface to the 'STRaitRazor'
  commandline tool) for added speed. 'STRaitRazoR' only works on linux and can found
  at <https://github.com/svilsen/STRaitRazoR>. The analyses and framework implemented
  in this package relies on the papers of Vilsen et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.01.017>
  and Vilsen et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.04.003>. Lastly, note that the
  parallelisation in the package relies on mclapply() and, thus, speed-ups will only
  be seen on UNIX based systems.
