title: Fit Hundreds of Theoretical Distributions to Empirical Data
maintainer: Markus Boenn
description: 'Systematic fit of hundreds of theoretical univariate distributions to
  empirical data via maximum likelihood estimation. Fits are reported and summarized
  by a data.frame, a csv file or a ''shiny'' app (here with additional features like
  visual representation of fits). All output formats provide assessment of goodness-of-fit
  by the following methods: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Shapiro-Wilks test, Anderson-Darling
  test.'
