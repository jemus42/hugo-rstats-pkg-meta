description: |-
  PLIS is a multiple testing procedure for testing several
  groups of hypotheses. Linear dependency is expected from the
  hypotheses within the same group and is modeled by hidden
  Markov Models. It is noted that, for PLIS, a smaller p value
  does not necessarily imply more significance because of
  dependency among the hypotheses. A typical application of PLIS
  is to analyze genome wide association studies datasets, where
  SNPs from the same chromosome are treated as a group and
  exhibit strong linear genomic dependency.
