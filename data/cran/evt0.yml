  estimates
maintainer: B G Manjunath
description: Computes extreme value index (EVI) estimate for heavy tailed models by
  Mean of order p (MOP)<U+000a>and peaks over random threshold (PORT) Hill methodologies.<U+000a>Besides,
  also computes moment, generalised Hill and mixed moment estimates for EVI.<U+000a>Compute
  high quantile or value-at-risk (VaR) based on above EVI estimates.
