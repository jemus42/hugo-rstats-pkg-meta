  Interaction Prediction Between Groundwater and Quarry Extension
  Using Discrete Choice Models and Artificial Neural Networks
maintainer: Johan Barthelemy
description: |-
  An implementation of two interaction indices between extractive
  activity and groundwater resources based on hazard and vulnerability
  parameters used in the assessment of natural hazards. One index is based
  on a discrete choice model and the other is relying on an artificial
  neural network.
