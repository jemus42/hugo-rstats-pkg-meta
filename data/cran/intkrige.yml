title: A Numerical Implementation of Interval-Valued Kriging
maintainer: Brennan Bean
description: |-
  An interval-valued extension of ordinary and simple kriging.
  Optimization of the function is based on a generalized interval distance.
  This creates a non-differentiable cost function that requires a
  differentiable approximation to the absolute value function. This
  differentiable approximation is optimized using a Newton-Raphson algorithm
  with a penalty function to impose the constraints. Analyses in the package
  are driven by the 'intsp' and 'intgrd'
  classes,
  which are interval-valued extensions of
  'SpatialPointsDataFrame' and 'SpatialPixelsDataFrame' respectively.
  The package includes several wrappers to functions in the
  'gstat' and 'sp' packages.
