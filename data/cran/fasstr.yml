title: Analyze, Summarize, and Visualize Daily Streamflow Data
maintainer: Jon Goetz
description: |-
  The Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R, 'fasstr', provides various
  functions to clean and screen daily stream discharge data; calculate and visualize various summary statistics
  and metrics; and compute annual trending (using 'zyp' package methods <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zyp>)
  and volume frequency analyses (using methods similar to HEC-SSP (2019)
  <https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ssp/>). It features useful function arguments for filtering of and
  handling dates, customizing data and metrics, and the ability to pull daily data directly from the Water Survey
  of Canada hydrometric database (<https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/hydrometrics/www/>).
