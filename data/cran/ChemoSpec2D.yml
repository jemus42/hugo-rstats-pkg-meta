title: Exploratory Chemometrics for 2D Spectroscopy
maintainer: Bryan A. Hanson
description: A collection of functions for exploratory chemometrics of 2D spectroscopic
  data sets such as COSY (correlated spectroscopy) and HSQC (heteronuclear single
  quantum coherence) 2D NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra. 'ChemoSpec2D' deploys
  methods aimed primarily at classification of samples and the identification of spectral
  features which are important in distinguishing samples from each other. Each 2D
  spectrum (a matrix) is treated as the unit of observation, and thus the physical
  sample in the spectrometer corresponds to the  sample from a statistical perspective.  In
  addition to chemometric tools, a few tools are provided for plotting 2D spectra,
  but these are not intended to replace the functionality typically available on the
  spectrometer. 'ChemoSpec2D' takes many of its cues from 'ChemoSpec' and tries to
  create consistent graphical output and to be very user friendly.
