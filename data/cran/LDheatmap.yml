title: Graphical Display of Pairwise Linkage Disequilibria Between SNPs
maintainer: Brad McNeney
description: |-
  Produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures
  of pairwise linkage disequilibria between SNPs. Users may
  optionally include the physical locations or genetic map
  distances of each SNP on the plot. Users should note that the
  imported package 'snpStats' and the suggested packages
  'rtracklayer', 'GenomicRanges', 'GenomInfoDb' and 'IRanges' are all
  BioConductor packages <https://bioconductor.org>.
