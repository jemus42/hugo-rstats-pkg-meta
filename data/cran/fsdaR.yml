  Robust Data Analysis Through Monitoring and Dynamic
  Visualization
maintainer: Valentin Todorov
description: |-
  Provides interface to the 'MATLAB' toolbox 'Flexible Statistical Data Analysis
  (FSDA)' which is a comprehensive and computationally efficient
  software package for robust statistics in regression, multivariate
  and categorical data analysis. The current R version implements tools
  for regression: (forward search, S- and MM-estimation, least trimmed
  squares (LTS) and least median of squares (LMS)), for multivariate analysis
  (forward search, S- and MM-estimation), for cluster analysis and cluster-wise regression.
  The distinctive feature of our package is the possibility of
  monitoring the statistics of interest as function of breakdown point,
  efficiency or subset size, depending on the estimator. This is
  accompanied by a rich set of graphical features, such as dynamic
  brushing, linking, particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.
