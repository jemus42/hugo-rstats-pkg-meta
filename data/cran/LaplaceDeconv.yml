  Laplace Deconvolution with Noisy Discrete Non-Equally Spaced
  Observations on a Finite Time Interval
maintainer: Yves Rozenholc
description: |-
  Solves the problem of Laplace deconvolution with noisy discrete
  non-equally spaced observations on a finite time interval based on expansions
  of the convolution kernel, the unknown function and the observed signal over
  Laguerre functions basis. It implements the methodology proposed in the paper
  "Laplace deconvolution on the basis of time domain data and its application to
  Dynamic Contrast Enhanced imaging" by F. Comte, C-A. Cuenod, M. Pensky and Y.
