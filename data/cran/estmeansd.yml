  Reported Quantiles in Meta-Analysis
maintainer: Sean McGrath
description: |-
  Implements the methods of McGrath et al. (2019) <arXiv:1903.10498>
  for estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from commonly reported
  quantiles in meta-analysis. These methods can be applied to studies that
  report the sample median, sample size, and one or both of (i) the sample
  minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first and third quartiles.
