  Bayesian Non-Parametric Dependent Models for Time-Indexed
  Functional Data
maintainer: Terrance Savitsky
description: |-
  Estimates a collection of time-indexed functions under
  either of Gaussian process (GP) or intrinsic Gaussian Markov
  random field (iGMRF) prior formulations where a Dirichlet process
  mixture allows sub-groupings of the functions to share the same
  covariance or precision parameters.  The GP and iGMRF formulations
  both support any number of additive covariance or precision terms,
  respectively, expressing either or both of multiple trend and
  seasonality.
