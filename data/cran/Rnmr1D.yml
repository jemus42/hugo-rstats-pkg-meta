description: Perform the complete processing of a set of proton nuclear magnetic resonance
  spectra from the free induction decay (raw data) and based on a processing sequence
  (macro-command file). An additional file specifies all the spectra to be considered
  by associating their sample code as well as the levels of experimental factors to
  which they belong. More detail can be found in Jacob et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11306-017-1178-y>.
