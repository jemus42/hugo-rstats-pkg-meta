title: Phylogenetic Assembly with Soft Taxonomic Inferences
maintainer: Gavin Thomas
description: |-
  A pre-processor for mrBayes that assimilates sequences, taxonomic
  information and tree constraints as per xxx.  The main functions of
  interest for most users will be pastis_simple, pastis_main and conch. The
  main analysis is conducted with pastis_simple or pastis_main followed by a
  manual execution of mrBayes (>3.2). The placement of taxa not contained in
  the tree constraint can be investigated using conch.
