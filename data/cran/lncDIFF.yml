title: Long Non-Coding RNA Differential Expression Analysis
maintainer: Qian Li
description: We developed an approach to detect differential expression features in
  long non-coding RNA low counts, using generalized linear model with zero-inflated
  exponential quasi likelihood ratio test. Methods implemented in this package are
  described in Li (2019) <doi:10.1186/s12864-019-5926-4>.
