title: Stochastic Precipitation Downscaling with the RainFARM Method
maintainer: Jost von Hardenberg
description: An implementation of the RainFARM (Rainfall Filtered Autoregressive Model)
  stochastic precipitation downscaling method (Rebora et al. (2006) <doi:10.1175/JHM517.1>).
  Adapted for climate downscaling according to D'Onofrio et al. (2018) <doi:10.1175/JHM-D-13-096.1>
  and for complex topography as in Terzago et al. (2018) <doi:10.5194/nhess-18-2825-2018>.
  The RainFARM method is based on the extrapolation to small scales of the Fourier
  spectrum of a large-scale precipitation field, using a fixed logarithmic slope and
  random phases at small scales, followed by a nonlinear transformation of the resulting
  linearly correlated stochastic field. RainFARM allows to generate ensembles of spatially
  downscaled precipitation fields which conserve precipitation at large scales and
  whose statistical properties are consistent with the small-scale statistics of observed
  precipitation, based only on knowledge of the large-scale precipitation field.
