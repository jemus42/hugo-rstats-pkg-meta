title: Tools to Generate Daily-Precipitation Time Series
maintainer: Emanuele Cordano
description: |-
  The method 'generate()' is extended for spatial multi-site
  stochastic generation of daily precipitation. It generates precipitation
  occurrence in several sites using logit regression (Generalized Linear
  Models) and D.S. Wilks' approach (Journal of Hydrology, 1998).
