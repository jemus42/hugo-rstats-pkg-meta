maintainer: Hansjoerg Neth
description: All datasets and functions required for the examples and exercises of
  the book "Data Science for Psychologists" (by Hansjoerg Neth, Konstanz University,
  2020), available at <https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/>. The book and course introduce
  principles and methods of data science to students of psychology and other biological
  or social sciences. The 'ds4psy' package primarily provides datasets, but also functions
  for data generation and manipulation (e.g., of text and time data) and graphics
  that are used in the book and its exercises. All functions included in 'ds4psy'
  are designed to be instructive and entertaining, rather than elegant or efficient.
