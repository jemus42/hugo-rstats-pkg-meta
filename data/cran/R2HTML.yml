title: HTML Exportation for R Objects
maintainer: Milan Bouchet-Valat
description: |-
  Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML
  file. Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a function
  that allows redirection on the fly, which appears to be very
  useful for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of
  the produced output to keep all that he did during the course.
  Package comes with a vignette describing how to write HTML
  reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for 'Sweave'
  allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to
  automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and
  graphs).
