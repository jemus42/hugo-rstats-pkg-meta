title: Spatial Bayesian Factor Analysis
maintainer: Samuel I. Berchuck
description: Implements a spatial Bayesian non-parametric factor analysis model with
  inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Spatial correlation
  is introduced in the columns of the factor loadings matrix using a Bayesian non-parametric
  prior, the probit stick-breaking process. Areal spatial data is modeled using a
  conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior and point-referenced spatial data is treated
  using a Gaussian process. The response variable can be modeled as Gaussian, probit,
  Tobit, or Binomial (using Polya-Gamma augmentation). Temporal correlation is introduced
  for the latent factors through a hierarchical structure and can be specified as
  exponential or first-order autoregressive.
