title: Robust Tests for Equal Correlation
maintainer: Danyang Yu
description: There are 6 novel robust tests for equal correlation. They are all based
  on logistic regressions. U are proportion to different types of correlation in  6
  methods. The ST1() is based on Pearson correlation. ST2() improved ST1() by using
  median absolute deviation. ST3() utilized type M correlation and ST4() used Spearman
  correlation. ST5() and ST6() used two different ways to combine ST3() and ST4().  We
  highly recommend ST5() according to the passage New Statistical Methods for Constructing
  Robust Differential Correlation Networks to characterize the interactions among
  microRNAs published in Scientific Reports.
