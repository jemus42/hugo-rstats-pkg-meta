title: Exact Sequential Analysis for Poisson and Binomial Data
maintainer: Ivair Ramos Silva
description: "Functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical power, expected
  time to signal, and required sample sizes for performing exact sequential analysis.
  All these\tcalculations can be done for either Poisson or binomial data, for continuous
  or group sequential analyses, and for different types of rejection boundaries. In
  case of group sequential analyses, the group sizes do not have to be specified in
  advance and the alpha spending can be arbitrarily settled."
