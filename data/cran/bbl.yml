maintainer: Jun Woo
description: |-
  Supervised learning using Boltzmann Bayes model inference,
  which extends naive Bayes model to include interactions. Enables
  classification of data into multiple response groups based on a large
  number of discrete predictors that can take factor values of
  heterogeneous levels. Either pseudo-likelihood or mean field
  inference can be used with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and
  prediction on new data.
