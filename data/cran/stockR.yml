title: Identifying Stocks in Genetic Data
maintainer: Scott D. Foster
description: 'Provides a mixture model for clustering individuals (or sampling groups)
  into stocks based on their genetic profile. Here, sampling groups are individuals
  that are sure to come from the same stock (e.g. breeding adults or larvae). The
  mixture (log-)likelihood is maximised using the EM-algorithm after find good starting
  values via a K-means clustering of the genetic data. Details can be found in Foster,
  Feutry, Grewe, Berry, Hui, Davies (2019) Reliably Discriminating Stock Structure
  with Genetic Markers: Mixture Models with Robust and Fast Computation. Molecular
  Ecology Resources.'
