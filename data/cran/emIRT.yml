title: EM Algorithms for Estimating Item Response Theory Models
maintainer: James Lo
description: |-
  Various Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are implemented for item response theory
  (IRT) models. The current implementation includes IRT models for binary and ordinal
  responses, along with dynamic and hierarchical IRT models with binary responses. The
  latter two models are derived and implemented using variational EM.  Subsequent edits
  also include variational network and text scaling models.
