title: Clinical Trial Designs in 'rstan'
maintainer: Kristian Brock
description: |-
  A collection of clinical trial designs and methods, implemented in
  'rstan' and R, including: the Continual Reassessment Method by O'Quigley et
  al. (1990) <doi:10.2307/2531628>; EffTox by Thall & Cook (2004)
  <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x>; and the Augmented Binary method by
  Wason & Seaman (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5867>; and more. We provide functions
  to aid model-fitting and analysis. The 'rstan' implementations may also
  serve as a cookbook to anyone looking to extend or embellish these models.
  We hope that this package encourages the use of Bayesian methods in clinical
  trials. There is a preponderance of early phase trial designs because this
  is where Bayesian methods are used most. If there is a method you would like
  implemented, please get in touch.
