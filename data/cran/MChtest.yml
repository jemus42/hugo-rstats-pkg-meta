title: Monte Carlo Hypothesis Tests with Sequential Stopping
maintainer: Michael P. Fay
description: Performs Monte Carlo hypothesis tests, allowing a couple of different
  sequential stopping boundaries. For example, a truncated sequential probability
  ratio test boundary (Fay, Kim and Hachey, 2007 <DOI:10.1198/106186007X257025>) and
  a boundary proposed by Besag and Clifford, 1991 <DOI:10.1093/biomet/78.2.301>. Gives
  valid p-values and confidence intervals on p-values.
