title: An Amazing Fast Way to Fit Elastic Net
maintainer: Linyu Zuo
description: Fit Elastic Net, Lasso, and Ridge regression and do cross-validation
  in a fast way. We build the algorithm based on Least Angle Regression by Bradley
  Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone, etc. (2004)(<doi:10.1214/009053604000000067
  >) and some algorithms like Givens rotation and Forward/Back Substitution. In this
  way, many matrices to be computed are retained as triangular matrices which can
  eventually speed up the computation. The fitting algorithm for Elastic Net is written
  in C++ using Armadillo linear algebra library.
