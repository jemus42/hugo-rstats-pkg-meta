maintainer: Simon Bond
description: Implements methods described by the paper Robins and Tsiatis (1991) <DOI:10.1080/03610929108830654>.
  These use g-estimation to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in a two-armed
  randomised control trial where non-compliance exists and is measured, under an assumption
  of an accelerated failure time model and no unmeasured confounders.
