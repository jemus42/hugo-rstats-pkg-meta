title: Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Based on Copulas
maintainer: Yasser Gonzalez-Fernandez
description: |-
  Provides a platform where EDAs (estimation of
  distribution algorithms) based on copulas can be implemented and
  studied. The package offers complete implementations of various
  EDAs based on copulas and vines, a group of well-known
  optimization problems, and utility functions to study the
  performance of the algorithms. Newly developed EDAs can be easily
  integrated into the package by extending an S4 class with generic
  functions for their main components.
