title: Closed Testing with Globaltest for Pathway Analysis
maintainer: Ningning Xu
description: A shortcut procedure is proposed to implement closed testing for large-scale
  multiple testings, especially with the global test. This shortcut is asymptotically
  equivalent to closed testing and post hoc. Users could detect any possible sets
  of features or pathways with family-wise error rate controlled. The global test
  is powerful to detect associations between a group of features and an outcome of
  interest.
