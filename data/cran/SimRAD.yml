title: Simulations to Predict the Number of RAD and GBS Loci
maintainer: Olivier Lepais
description: Provides a number of functions to simulate restriction enzyme digestion,
  library construction and fragments size selection to predict the number of loci
  expected from most of the Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) and Genotyping By
  Sequencing (GBS) approaches. SimRAD estimates the number of loci expected from a
  particular genome depending on the protocol type and parameters allowing to assess
  feasibility, multiplexing capacity and the amount of sequencing required.
