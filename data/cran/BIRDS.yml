  It helps making the evaluation and preparation of biodiversity data
  easy, systematic and reproducible. It also helps the users to overlay the
  point observations into a custom grid that is useful for further analysis.
  The review summarise statistics that helps evaluate whether a set of species
  observations is fit-for-use and take decisions upon its use of on further
  analyses. It does so by quantifying the sampling effort (amount of effort
  expended during an event) and data completeness (data gaps) to help judge
  whether the data is representative, valid and fit for any intended purpose.
  The 'BIRDS' package is most useful when working with heterogeneous data sets
  with variation in the sampling process, i.e. where data have been collected
  and reported in various ways and therefore varying in sampling effort
  and data completeness (i.e. how well the reported observations describe the
  true state). Primary biodiversity data (PBD) combining data from different
  data sets, like e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) mediated
  data, commonly vary in the ways data has been generated - containing
  opportunistically collected presence-only data together with and data from
  systematic monitoring programs. The set of tools provided is aimed at
  understanding the process that generated the data (i.e. observing, recording
  and reporting species into databases). There is a non-vital function on this
  package (makeDggrid()) that depends the package 'dggridR' that is no longer on CRAN.
