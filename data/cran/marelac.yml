description: |-
  Datasets, constants, conversion factors, and utilities for 'MArine', 'Riverine',
  'Estuarine', 'LAcustrine' and 'Coastal' science.
  The package contains among others: (1) chemical and
  physical constants and datasets, e.g. atomic weights, gas
  constants, the earths bathymetry; (2) conversion factors
  (e.g. gram to mol to liter, barometric units,
  temperature, salinity); (3) physical functions, e.g. to
  estimate concentrations of conservative substances, gas
  transfer and diffusion coefficients, the Coriolis force
  and gravity; (4) thermophysical properties of the
  seawater, as from the UNESCO polynomial or from the more
  recent derivation based on a Gibbs function.
