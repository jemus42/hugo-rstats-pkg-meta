title: Approximate Gaussian Processes Using the Fourier Basis
maintainer: Chris Paciorek
description: |-
  Routines for creating, manipulating, and performing
  Bayesian inference about Gaussian processes in
  one and two dimensions using the Fourier basis approximation:
  simulation and plotting of processes, calculation of
  coefficient variances, calculation of process density,
  coefficient proposals (for use in MCMC).  It uses R environments to
  store GP objects as references/pointers.
