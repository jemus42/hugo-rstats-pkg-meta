title: Mixture-of-Experts Modeling for Complex Non-Normal Distributions
maintainer: Florian Lecocq
description: |-
  Provides a unified mixture-of-experts (ME) modeling and
  estimation framework with several original and flexible ME models to
  model, cluster and classify heterogeneous data in many complex
  situations where the data are distributed according to non-normal,
  possibly skewed distributions, and when they might be corrupted by
  atypical observations. Mixtures-of-Experts models for complex and
  non-normal distributions ('meteorits') are originally introduced and
  written in 'Matlab' by Faicel Chamroukhi. The references are mainly the
  following ones. The references are mainly the following ones.
