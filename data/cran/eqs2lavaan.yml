title: EQS Output Conversion to lavaan Functions
maintainer: Craig M. Krebsbach
description: Transitioning from EQS to R for structural equation modeling (SEM)<U+000a>is
  made easier with a set of functions to convert .out files into R code.<U+000a>The
  EQS output can be converted into lavaan syntax and run in the R<U+000a>environment.  Other
  functions parse descriptive statistics and the covariance matrix<U+000a>from an
  EQS .out file.  A heat map plot of a covariance matrix is also<U+000a>included.
