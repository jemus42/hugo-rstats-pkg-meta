title: Pattern Oriented Modelling Information Criterion
maintainer: Cyril Piou
description: Calculations of an information criterion are proposed to check the quality
  of simulations results of Agent-based models (ABM/IBM) or other non-linear rule-based
  models. The POMDEV measure (Pattern Oriented Modelling DEViance) is based on the
  Kullback-Leibler divergence and likelihood theory. It basically indicates the deviance
  of simulation results from field observations. Once POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting
  sampling on different model versions are effectuated, POMIC scores (Pattern Oriented
  Modelling Information Criterion) can be calculated. This method could be further
  developed to incorporate multiple patterns assessment. Piou C, U Berger and V Grimm
