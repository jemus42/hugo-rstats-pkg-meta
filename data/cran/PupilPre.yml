title: Preprocessing Pupil Size Data
maintainer: Aki-Juhani Kyröläinen
description: |-
  Pupillometric data collected using SR Research Eyelink eye trackers
  requires significant preprocessing. This package contains functions for
  preparing pupil dilation data for visualization and statistical analysis.
  Specifically, it provides a pipeline of functions which aid in data validation,
  the removal of blinks/artifacts, downsampling, and baselining, among others.
  Additionally, plotting functions for creating grand average and conditional
  average plots are provided. See the vignette for samples of the functionality.
  The package is designed for handling data collected with SR Research
  Eyelink eye trackers using Sample Reports created in SR Research Data
  Viewer.
