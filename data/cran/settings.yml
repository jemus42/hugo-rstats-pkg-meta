title: Software Option Settings Manager for R
maintainer: Mark van der Loo
description: |-
  Provides option settings management that goes
  beyond R's default 'options' function. With this package, users can define
  their own option settings manager holding option names, default values and
  (if so desired) ranges or sets of allowed option values that will be
  automatically checked. Settings can then be retrieved, altered and reset
  to defaults with ease. For R programmers and package developers it offers
  cloning and merging functionality which allows for conveniently defining
  global and local options, possibly in a multilevel options hierarchy. See
  the package vignette for some examples concerning functions, S4 classes,
  and reference classes. There are convenience functions to reset par()
  and options() to their 'factory defaults'.
