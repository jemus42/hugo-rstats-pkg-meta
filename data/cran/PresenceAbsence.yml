title: Presence-Absence Model Evaluation.
maintainer: Elizabeth Freeman
description: This package provides a set of functions useful when<U+000a>evaluating
  the results of presence-absence models. Package<U+000a>includes functions for calculating
  threshold dependent measures<U+000a>such as confusion matrices, pcc, sensitivity,
  specificity, and<U+000a>Kappa, and produces plots of each measure as the threshold
  is<U+000a>varied. It will calculate optimal threshold choice according to<U+000a>a
  choice of optimization criteria. It also includes functions<U+000a>to plot the threshold
  independent ROC curves along with the<U+000a>associated AUC (area under the curve).
