title: Modeling and Assessing Similarity of Drug Dissolutions Profiles
maintainer: Kathrin Moellenhoff
description: Implementation of a model-based bootstrap approach for testing whether
  two formulations are similar. The package provides a function for fitting a pharmacokinetic
  model to time-concentration data and comparing the results for all five candidate
  models regarding the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). The candidate set contains a
  First order, Hixson-Crowell, Higuchi, Weibull and a logistic model. The assessment
  of similarity implemented in this package is performed regarding the maximum deviation
  of the profiles. See Moellenhoff et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7689> for details.
