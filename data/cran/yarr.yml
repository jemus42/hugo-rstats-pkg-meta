title: Yet Another 'ARFF' Reader
maintainer: David Charte
description: |-
  A parser and a writer for 'WEKA' Attribute-Relation File Format
  <https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/arff_stable/> in pure R, with no dependencies.
  As opposed to other R implementations, this package can read standard
  (dense) as well as sparse files, i.e. those where each row does only contain
  nonzero components. Unlike 'RWeka', 'yarr' does not require any 'Java' installation
  nor is dependent on external software. This implementation is generalized from
  those in packages 'mldr' and 'mldr.datasets'.
