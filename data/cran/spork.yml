title: Generalized Label Formatting
maintainer: Tim Bergsma
description: |-
  The 'spork' syntax describes
  label formatting concisely, supporting
  mixed nesting of subscripts and superscripts
  to arbitrary depth. It intends to be easy
  to read and write in plain text, and easy
  to convert to equivalent presentations
  in 'plotmath' and 'latex'.  Greek symbols
  and a multiplication symbol are explicitly
  supported. See ?as_spork and ?as_previews.
