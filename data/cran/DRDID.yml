version: 1.0.0
title: Doubly Robust Difference-in-Differences Estimators
maintainer: Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna
description: |-
  Implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD)
  estimators for the average treatment effect proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020)
  <arXiv:1812.01723>. The estimator combines inverse probability weighting and outcome
  regression estimators (also implemented in the package) to form estimators with
  more attractive statistical properties. Two different estimation methods can be used
  to estimate the nuisance functions.
