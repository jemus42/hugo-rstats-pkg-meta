version: 1.1-6
title: Modelling and Analysis of Dynamic Computer Experiments
maintainer: Ru Zhang
description: |-
  Emulating and solving inverse problems for dynamic computer experiments.
  It contains two major functionalities: (1) localized GP model for large-scale
  dynamic computer experiments using the algorithm proposed by
  Zhang et al. (2018) <arXiv:1611.09488>; (2) solving inverse problems
  in dynamic computer experiments. The current version only supports 64-bit
  version of R.
