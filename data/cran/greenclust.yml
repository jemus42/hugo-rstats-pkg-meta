version: 1.1.0
title: Combine Categories Using Greenacre's Method
maintainer: Jeff Jetton
description: |-
  Implements a method of iteratively collapsing the rows of a
  contingency table, two at a time, by selecting the pair of categories whose
  combination yields a new table with the smallest loss of chi-squared, as
  described by Greenacre, M.J. (1988) <doi:10.1007/BF01901670>. The result is
  compatible with the class of object returned by the 'stats' package's
  hclust() function and can be used similarly (plotted as a dendrogram,
  cut, etc.). Additional functions are provided for automatic cutting and
  diagnostic plotting.
