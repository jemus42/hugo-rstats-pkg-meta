title: Joint Segmentation of Multivariate (Copy Number) Signals
maintainer: Morgane Pierre-Jean
description: |-
  Methods for fast segmentation of multivariate
  signals into piecewise constant profiles and for generating realistic
  copy-number profiles. A typical application is the joint segmentation of total
  DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
  (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies. The methods are described in Pierre-Jean,
  Rigaill and Neuvial (2015) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbu026>.
