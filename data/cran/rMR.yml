  Importing Data from Loligo Systems Software, Calculating
  Metabolic Rates and Critical Tensions
maintainer: Tyler L. Moulton
description: Analysis of oxygen consumption data generated by Loligo (R) Systems respirometry
  equipment. The package includes a function for loading data output by Loligo's 'AutoResp'
  software (get.witrox.data()), functions for calculating metabolic rates over user-specified
  time intervals, extracting critical points from data using broken stick regressions
  based on Yeager and Ultsch (<DOI:10.1086/physzool.62.4.30157935>), and easy functions
  for converting between different units of barometric pressure.
