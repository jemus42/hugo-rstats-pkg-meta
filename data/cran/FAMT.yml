title: 'Factor Analysis for Multiple Testing (FAMT) : simultaneous tests<U+000a>under
  dependence in high-dimensional data'
maintainer: David Causeur
description: The method proposed in this package takes into account the impact of
  dependence on the multiple testing procedures for high-throughput data as proposed
  by Friguet et al. (2009). The common information shared by all the variables is
  modeled by a factor analysis structure. The number of factors considered in the
  model is chosen to reduce the false discoveries variance in multiple tests. The
  model parameters are estimated thanks to an EM algorithm. Adjusted tests statistics
  are derived, as well as the associated p-values. The proportion of true null hypotheses
  (an important parameter when controlling the false discovery rate) is also estimated
  from the FAMT model. Graphics are proposed to interpret and describe the factors.
