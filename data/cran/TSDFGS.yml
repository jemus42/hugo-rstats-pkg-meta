description: Determining training set for genomic selection using a genetic algorithm
  (Holland J.H. (1975) <DOI:10.1145/1216504.1216510>) or simple exchange algorithm
  (change an individual every iteration). Three different criteria are used in both
  algorithms, which are r-score (Ou J.H., Liao C.T. (2018) <DOI:10.6342/NTU201802290>),
  PEV-score (Akdemir D. et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1186/s12711-015-0116-6>) and CD-score
  (Laloe D. (1993) <DOI:10.1186/1297-9686-25-6-557>). Phenotypic data for candidate
  set is not necessary for all these methods. By using it, one may readily determine
  a training set that can be expected to provide a better training set comparing to
  random sampling.
