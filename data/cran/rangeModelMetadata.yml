  Range Modeling Metadata Standards (RMMS) address three challenges:
  they (i) are designed for convenience to encourage use, (ii) accommodate a wide
  variety of applications, and (iii) are extensible to allow the community of range
  modelers to steer it as needed. RMMS are based on a data dictionary that specifies
  a hierarchical structure to catalog different aspects of the range modeling process.
  The dictionary balances a constrained, minimalist vocabulary to improve
  standardization with flexibility for users to provide their own values.
  Merow et al. (2019) <DOI:10.1111/geb.12993> describe the standards in
  more detail. Note that users who prefer to use the R package 'ecospat' can obtain it from
  <https://github.com/ecospat/ecospat>.
