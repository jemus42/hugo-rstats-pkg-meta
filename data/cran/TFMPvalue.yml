  Efficient and Accurate P-Value Computation for Position Weight
  Matrices
maintainer: Ge Tan
description: |-
  In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs)
  identification from sequence/alignments,
  we are interested in the significance of certain match score.
  TFMPvalue provides the accurate calculation of P-value with
  score threshold for Position Weight Matrices,
  or the score with given P-value.
  It is an interface to code originally made available by
  Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007,
  Algorithms Mol Biol:2, 15.
