title: '''htmlwidget'' for Interactive Views of R Lists'
maintainer: Kent Russell
description: |-
  R lists, especially nested lists, can be very difficult to
  visualize or represent. Sometimes 'str()' is not enough, so this suite of
  htmlwidgets is designed to help see, understand, and maybe even modify your R
  lists.  The function 'reactjson()' requires a package
  'reactR' that can be installed from CRAN or <https://github.com/timelyportfolio/reactR>.
