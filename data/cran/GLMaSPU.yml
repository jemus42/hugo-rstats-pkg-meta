  An Adaptive Test on High Dimensional Parameters in Generalized
  Linear Models
maintainer: Chong Wu
description: 'Several tests for high dimensional generalized linear models have been
  proposed recently. In this package, we implemented a new test called adaptive  sum
  of powered score (aSPU) for high dimensional generalized linear models, which is
  often more powerful than the existing methods in a wide scenarios. We also implemented
  permutation based version of several existing methods for research purpose. We recommend
  users use the aSPU test for their real testing problem. You can learn more about
  the tests implemented in the package via the following papers: 1. Pan, W., Kim,
