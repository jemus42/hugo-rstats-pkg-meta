  Improved Standard Evaluation Interfaces for Common Data
  Manipulation Tasks
maintainer: John Mount
description: |-
  The 'seplyr' (standard evaluation plying) package supplies improved
  standard evaluation adapter methods for important common 'dplyr' data manipulation tasks.
  In addition the 'seplyr' package supplies several new "key operations
  bound together" methods.  These include 'group_summarize()' (which
  combines grouping, arranging and calculation in an atomic unit),
  'add_group_summaries()' (which joins grouped summaries into a 'data.frame'
  in a well documented manner), 'add_group_indices()' (which adds
  per-group identifiers to a 'data.frame' without depending on row-order),
  'partition_mutate_qt()' (which optimizes mutate sequences), and 'if_else_device()'
  (which simulates per-row if-else blocks in expression sequences).
