title: Combining Mixture Components for Clustering
maintainer: J.-P. Baudry
description: The Rmixmod package provides model-based clustering by fitting a mixture
  model (e.g. Gaussian components for quantitative continuous data) to the data and
  identifying each cluster with one of its components. The number of components can
  be determined from the data, typically using the BIC criterion. In practice, however,
  individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian distributions, and in that
  case model-based clustering tends to represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture
  of two or more Gaussian components. If the number of mixture components is interpreted
  as the number of clusters, this can lead to overestimation of the number of clusters.
  This is because BIC selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a
  good approximation to the density. This package, RmixmodCombi, according to \emph{Combining
  Mixture Components for Clustering} by J.P. Baudry, A.E. Raftery, G. Celeux, K. Lo,
  R. Gottardo, combines the components of the EM/BIC solution (provided by Rmixmod)
  hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This yields a clustering for each
  number of clusters less than or equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on
  substantive grounds, and we also provide a way of selecting the number of clusters
  via a piecewise linear regression fit to the (possibly rescaled) entropy plot.
