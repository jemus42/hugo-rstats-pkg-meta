title: Robust Partial Least Squares
maintainer: Peter Filzmoser
description: A robust Partial Least-Squares (PLS) method is implemented that is robust
  to outliers in the residuals as well as to leverage points. A specific weighting
  scheme is applied which avoids iterations, and leads to a highly efficient robust
  PLS estimator.
