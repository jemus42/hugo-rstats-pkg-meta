title: Functions for Dyadic Sequence Analyses
maintainer: Peter Fuchs
description: |-
  Functions for dyadic binary/dichotomous sequence analyses are implemented in this contribution.
  The focus is on estimating actor-partner-interaction models using various approaches, for
  instances the approach of Bakeman & Gottman's (1997) <DOI:10.1017/cbo9780511527685>,
  generalized multi-level models, and basic Markov models. Moreover, coefficients of one model
  can be translated into those of the other models. Finally, simulation-based power analyses are
  provided.
