title: Time Series Regression Models with Distributed Lag Models
maintainer: Haydar Demirhan
description: Provides time series regression models with one predictor using finite
  distributed lag models, polynomial (Almon) distributed lag models, geometric distributed
  lag models with Koyck transformation, and autoregressive distributed lag models.
  It also consists of functions for computation of h-step ahead forecasts from these
  models. See Demirhan (2020)(<doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0228812>) and Baltagi (2011)(<doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20059-5>)
