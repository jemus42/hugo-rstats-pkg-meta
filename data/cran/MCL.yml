title: Markov Cluster Algorithm
maintainer: Ronja Foraita
description: Contains the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) for identifying clusters
  in networks and graphs. The algorithm simulates random walks on a (n x n) matrix
  as the adjacency matrix of a graph. It alternates an expansion step and an inflation
  step until an equilibrium state is reached.
