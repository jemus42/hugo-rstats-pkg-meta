  Computation of Spatial Covariance Matrices for Data on
  Rectangles
maintainer: David Clifford
description: Functions that compute the spatial covariance matrix for the matern and
  power classes of spatial models, for data that arise on rectangular units.  This
  code can also be used for the change of support problem and for spatial data that
  arise on irregularly shaped regions like counties or zipcodes by laying a fine grid
  of rectangles and aggregating the integrals in a form of Riemann integration.
