title: Copy Number Profiling using Sequencing and CBS
maintainer: Jeremy J. Shen
description: |-
  This is a method for DNA Copy Number Profiling using
  Next-Generation Sequencing. It has new model and test
  statistics based on non-homogeneous Poisson Processes with
  change point models. It uses an adaptation of Circular Binary
  Segmentation. Also included are methods for point-wise Bayesian
  Confidence Interval and model selection method for the
  change-point model. A case and a control sample reads (normal
  and tumor) are required.
