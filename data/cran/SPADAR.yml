title: Spherical Projections of Astronomical Data
maintainer: Alberto Krone-Martins
description: Provides easy to use functions to create all-sky grid plots of widely
  used astronomical coordinate systems (equatorial, ecliptic, galactic) and scatter
  plots of data on any of these systems including on-the-fly system conversion. It
  supports any type of spherical projection to the plane defined by the 'mapproj'
  package.
