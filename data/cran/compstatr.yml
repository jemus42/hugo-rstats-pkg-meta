title: Tools for St. Louis Crime Data
maintainer: Christopher Prener
description: |-
  Provides a set of tools for creating yearly data sets of St. Louis
  Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD) crime data, which are available from
  January 2008 onward as monthly CSV releases on their website
  (<http:www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml>). Once data are validated and created
  (monthly data releases have varying numbers of columns
  as well as different column names and formats), 'compstatr' also provides
  functions for categorizing and mapping crimes in St. Louis. The categorization
  tools that are provided will also work with any police department that uses 5
  and 6 digit numeric codes to identify specific crimes. These data provide researchers
  and policy makers detailed data for St. Louis, which in the last several years
  has had some of the highest or the highest violent crime rates in the United States.
