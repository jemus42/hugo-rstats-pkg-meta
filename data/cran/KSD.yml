title: Goodness-of-Fit Tests using Kernelized Stein Discrepancy
maintainer: Min Hyung Kang
description: An adaptation of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy, this package provides
  a goodness-of-fit test of whether a given i.i.d. sample is drawn from a given distribution.
  It works for any distribution once its score function (the derivative of log-density)
  can be provided. This method is based on "A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit
  Tests and Model Evaluation" by Liu, Lee, and Jordan, available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03253>.
