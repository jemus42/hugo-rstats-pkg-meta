title: Tests on Properties of Space-Time Covariance Functions
maintainer: Sandra De Iaco
description: |-
  Tests on properties of space-time covariance functions.
  Tests on symmetry, separability and for assessing
  different forms of non-separability are available. Moreover tests on
  some classes of covariance functions, such that the classes of
  product-sum models, Gneiting models and integrated product models have
  been provided.  It is the companion R package to the paper of
  Cappello C., De Iaco S. and Posa D. <doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1472-2>.
