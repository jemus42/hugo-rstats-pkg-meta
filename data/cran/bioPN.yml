title: Simulation of deterministic and stochastic biochemical reaction<U+000a>networks
  using Petri Nets
maintainer: Roberto Bertolusso
description: <U+000a>bioPN is a package suited to perform simulation of deterministic
  and stochastic systems of biochemical reaction<U+000a>networks.<U+000a>Models are
  defined using a subset of Petri Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical reactions<U+000a>are
  defined.<U+000a>For deterministic solutions, bioPN creates the associated system
  of differential equations "on the fly", and<U+000a>solves it with a Runge Kutta
  Dormand Prince 45 explicit algorithm.<U+000a>For stochastic solutions, bioPN offers
  variants of Gillespie algorithm, or SSA.<U+000a>For hybrid deterministic/stochastic,<U+000a>it
  employs the Haseltine and Rawlings algorithm, that partitions the system in fast
  and slow reactions.<U+000a>bioPN algorithms are developed in C to achieve adequate
  performance.
