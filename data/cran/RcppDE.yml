title: Global Optimization by Differential Evolution in C++
maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel
description: |-
  An efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim'
  function which performs global optimization by differential evolution.
  Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier,
  shorter, faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all
  three goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++.  The
  initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to
  an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have
  since been eliminated in 'DEoptim'.
