title: Vectorised Tools for URL Handling and Parsing
maintainer: Os Keyes
description: |-
  A toolkit for all URL-handling needs, including encoding and decoding,
  parsing, parameter extraction and modification. All functions are
  designed to be both fast and entirely vectorised. It is intended to be
  useful for people dealing with web-related datasets, such as server-side
  logs, although may be useful for other situations involving large sets of
  URLs.
