description: |-
  Access data stored in 'REDCap' databases using the Application
  Programming Interface (API).  'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data CAPture;
  <https://projectredcap.org>) is
  a web application for building and managing online surveys and databases
  developed at Vanderbilt University.  The API allows users to access data
  and project meta data (such as the data dictionary) from the web
  programmatically.  The 'redcapAPI' package facilitates the process of
  accessing data with options to prepare an analysis-ready data set
  consistent with the definitions in a database's data dictionary.
