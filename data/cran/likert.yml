title: Analysis and Visualization Likert Items
maintainer: Jason Bryer
description: |-
  An approach to analyzing Likert response items, with an emphasis on visualizations.
  The stacked bar plot is the preferred method for presenting Likert results. Tabular results
  are also implemented along with density plots to assist researchers in determining whether
  Likert responses can be used quantitatively instead of qualitatively. See the likert(),
  summary.likert(), and plot.likert() functions to get started.
