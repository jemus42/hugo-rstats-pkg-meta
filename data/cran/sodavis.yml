  SODA: Main and Interaction Effects Selection for Logistic
  Regression, Quadratic Discriminant and General Index Models
maintainer: Yang Li
description: Variable and interaction selection are essential to classification in
  high-dimensional setting. In this package, we provide the implementation of SODA
  procedure, which is a forward-backward algorithm that selects both main and interaction
  effects under logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis. We also provide
  an extension, S-SODA, for dealing with the variable selection problem for semi-parametric
  models with continuous responses.
