title: Simulation-Based Maximum Likelihood Parameter Estimation
maintainer: Paul Staab
description: |-
  An estimation method that can use computer simulations to
  approximate maximum-likelihood estimates even when the likelihood function can not
  be evaluated directly. It can be applied whenever it is feasible to conduct many
  simulations, but works best when the data is approximately Poisson distributed.
  It was originally designed for demographic inference in evolutionary
  biology. It has optional support for conducting coalescent simulation using
  the 'coala' package.
