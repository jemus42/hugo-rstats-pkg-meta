  Computing Weighted Topological Overlaps (wTO) & Consensus wTO
  Network
maintainer: Deisy Morselli Gysi
description: Computes the Weighted Topological Overlap with positive and negative
  signs (wTO) networks given a data frame containing the mRNA count/ expression/ abundance
  per sample, and a vector containing the interested nodes of interaction (a subset
  of the elements of the full data frame). It also computes the cut-off threshold
  or p-value based on the individuals bootstrap or the values reshuffle per individual.
  It also allows the construction of a consensus network, based on multiple wTO networks.
  The package includes a visualization tool for the networks.  More about the methodology
  can be found at <arXiv:1711.04702>.
