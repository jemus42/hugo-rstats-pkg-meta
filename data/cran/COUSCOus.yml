title: A Residue-Residue Contact Detecting Method
maintainer: Reda Rawi
description: Contact prediction using shrinked covariance (COUSCOus). COUSCOus is
  a residue-residue contact detecting method approaching the contact inference using
  the glassofast implementation of Matyas and Sustik (2012, The University of Texas
  at Austin UTCS Technical Report 2012:1-3. TR-12-29.) that solves the L_1 regularised
  Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation of the inverse of a covariance matrix. Prior
  to the inverse covariance matrix estimation we utilise a covariance matrix shrinkage
  approach, the empirical Bayes covariance estimator, which has been shown by Haff
  (1980) <DOI:10.1214/aos/1176345010> to be the best estimator in a Bayesian framework,
  especially dominating estimators of the form aS, such as the smoothed covariance
  estimator applied in a related contact inference technique PSICOV.
