title: A Modular Multi-Step Graph Generator
maintainer: Jakob Bossek
description: Set of functions for step-wise generation of (weighted) graphs. Aimed
  for research in the field of single- and multi-objective combinatorial optimization.
  Graphs are generated adding nodes, edges and weights. Each step may be repeated
  multiple times with different predefined and custom generators resulting in high
  flexibility regarding the graph topology and structure of edge weights.
