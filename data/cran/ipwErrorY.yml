  Inverse Probability Weighted Estimation of Average Treatment
  Effect with Misclassified Binary Outcome
maintainer: Di Shu
description: An implementation of the correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017)
  <doi:10.1177/0962280217743777> for the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimation
  of average treatment effect (ATE) with misclassified binary outcomes. Logistic regression
  model is assumed for treatment model for all implemented correction methods, and
  is assumed for the outcome model for the implemented doubly robust correction method.
  Misclassification probability given a true value of the outcome is assumed to be
  the same for all individuals.
