title: Integrative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Approaches
maintainer: Wentao Lu
description: |-
  To integrate multiple GSEA studies, we propose a hybrid strategy,
  iGSEA-AT, for choosing random effects (RE) versus fixed effect (FE) models,
  with an attempt to achieve the potential maximum statistical efficiency as
  well as stability in performance in various practical situations. In addition
  to iGSEA-AT, this package also provides options to perform integrative GSEA
  with testing based on a FE model (iGSEA-FE) and testing based on a RE model
  (iGSEA-RE). The approaches account for different set sizes when testing a
  database of gene sets. The function is easy to use, and the three approaches
  can be applied to both binary and continuous phenotypes.
