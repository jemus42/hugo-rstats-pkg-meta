title: Phonetic-Coding for Portuguese
maintainer: Daniel Marcelino
description: |-
  The SoundexBR package provides an algorithm for decoding names
  into phonetic codes, as pronounced in Portuguese. The goal is for
  homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be
  matched despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly encodes
  consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. The
  soundex code resultant consists of a four digits long string composed by
  one letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first
  letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants.
