title: GPU Functions for R Objects
maintainer: Charles Determan Jr.
description: |-
  Provides GPU enabled functions for R objects in a simple and
  approachable manner.  New gpu* and vcl* classes have been provided to
  wrap typical R objects (e.g. vector, matrix), in both host and device
  spaces, to mirror typical R syntax without the need to know OpenCL.
