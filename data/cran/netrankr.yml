title: Analyzing Partial Rankings in Networks
maintainer: David Schoch
description: |-
  Implements methods for centrality related analyses of networks.
  While the package includes the possibility to build more than 20 indices,
  its main focus lies on index-free assessment of centrality via partial
  rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion or positional dominance. These
  partial rankings can be analyzed with different methods, including
  probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and relative
  rank probabilities (how likely is it that a node is more central than another?).
  The methodology is described in depth in the vignettes and in
  Schoch (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.003>.
