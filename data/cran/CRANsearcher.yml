  RStudio Addin for Searching Packages in CRAN Database Based on
  Keywords
maintainer: Agustin Calatroni
description: One of the strengths of R is its vast package ecosystem. Indeed, R packages
  extend from visualization to Bayesian inference and from spatial analyses to pharmacokinetics
  (<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/>). There is probably not an area of quantitative
  research that isn't represented by at least one R package. At the time of this writing,
  there are more than 10,000 active CRAN packages. Because of this massive ecosystem,
  it is important to have tools to search and learn about packages related to your
  personal R needs. For this reason, we developed an RStudio addin capable of searching
  available CRAN packages directly within RStudio.
