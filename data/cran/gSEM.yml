title: Semi-Supervised Generalized Structural Equation Modeling
maintainer: Junheng Ma
description: Conducts a semi-gSEM statistical analysis (semi-supervised generalized
  structural equation modeling) on a data frame of coincident observations of multiple
  predictive or intermediate variables and a final continuous, outcome variable, via
  two functions sgSEMp1() and sgSEMp2(), representing fittings based on two statistical
  principles. Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the
  spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables,
  including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian
  property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the
  next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value
  of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value.
  Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors
  are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level
  predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module
  degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant
  intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables
  (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level
  multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is
  continued until all sensible models are investigated.
