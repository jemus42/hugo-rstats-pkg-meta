description: |-
  Using the DNA sequence and gene annotation files provided in
  'ENSEMBL' <https://www.ensembl.org/index.html>,
  the functions implemented in the package try to find the DNA sequences and
  protein sequences of any given genomic loci, and to find the genomic coordinates
  and protein sequences of any given protein locations, which are the frequent
  tasks in the analysis of genomic and proteomic data.
