title: Amdahl's Profiler, Directed Optimization Made Easy
maintainer: Marco D. Visser
description: |-
  Assists the evaluation of whether and
  where to focus code optimization, using Amdahl's law and visual aids
  based on line profiling. Amdahl's profiler organizes profiling output
  files (including memory profiling) in a visually appealing way.
  It is meant to help to balance development
  vs. execution time by helping to identify the most promising sections
  of code to optimize and projecting potential gains. The package is
  an addition to R's standard profiling tools and is not a wrapper for them.
