maintainer: Ethan McCallum
description: Per the Factual.com website, "Factual is a platform where<U+000a>anyone
  can share and mash open, living data on any subject."<U+000a>The data is in the
  form of tables and is accessible via REST<U+000a>API.  The factualR package is a
  thin wrapper around the<U+000a>Factual.com API, to make it even easier for people
  working with<U+000a>R to explore Factual.com data sets.
