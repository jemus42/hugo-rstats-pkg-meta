description: |-
  Tools of Bayesian analysis framework using the method
  suggested by Berger (1985) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-4286-2> for
  multivariate normal (MVN) distribution and multivariate normal
  mixture (MixMVN) distribution:
  a) calculating Bayesian posteriori of (Mix)MVN distribution;
  b) generating random vectors of (Mix)MVN distribution;
  c) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for (Mix)MVN distribution.
