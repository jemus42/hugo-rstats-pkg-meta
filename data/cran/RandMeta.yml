  Efficient Numerical Algorithm for Exact Inference in Meta
  Analysis
maintainer: Lu Tian
description: A novel numerical algorithm that provides functionality for estimating
  the exact 95% confidence interval of the location parameter in the random effects
  model, and is much faster than the naive method. Works best when the number of studies
  is between 6-20.
