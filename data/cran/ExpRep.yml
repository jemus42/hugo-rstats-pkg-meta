title: Experiment Repetitions
maintainer: Larisa Zamora-Matamoros
description: |-
  Allows to calculate the probabilities  of occurrences of an event in a
  great number of repetitions of Bernoulli experiment, through the application of
  the local and the integral theorem of De Moivre Laplace, and the theorem of Poisson.
  Gives the possibility to show the results graphically and analytically, and to compare
  the results obtained by the application of the above  theorems with those calculated by
  the direct application of the Binomial formula. Is basically useful for educational
  purposes.
