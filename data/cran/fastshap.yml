title: Fast Approximate Shapley Values
maintainer: Brandon Greenwell
description: |-
  Computes fast (relative to other implementations) approximate
  Shapley values for any supervised learning model. Shapley values help to
  explain the predictions from any black box model using ideas from game
  theory; see Strumbel and Kononenko (2014) <doi:10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x>
  for details.
