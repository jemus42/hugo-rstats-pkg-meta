title: Composite Grid Gaussian Processes
maintainer: Collin Erickson
description: |-
  Run computer experiments using the adaptive composite grid
  algorithm with a Gaussian process model.
  The algorithm works best when running an experiment that can evaluate thousands
  of points from a deterministic computer simulation.
  This package is an implementation of a forthcoming paper by Plumlee,
  Erickson, Ankenman, et al. For a preprint of the paper,
  contact the maintainer of this package.
