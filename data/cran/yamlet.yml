title: Versatile Curation of Table Metadata
maintainer: Tim Bergsma
description: |-
  The 'yamlet' package implements a file-based
  mechanism for documenting datasets. It reads and writes
  YAML-formatted metadata and applies it as data
  item attributes. Data and metadata are stored independently
  but can be coordinated by using similar file paths with
  different extensions.  The 'yamlet' dialect is valid 'YAML',
  but some conventions are chosen to improve readability.
  Defaults and conventions can be over-ridden by the user.
  See ?yamlet and ?decorate.data.frame.
  See ?read_yamlet ?write_yamlet, and ?io_csv.
