title: Multiple Pairwise Comparison Tests
maintainer: Indrajeet Patil
description: |-
  Multiple pairwise comparison tests on tidy data for
  one-way analysis of variance for both between-subjects and
  within-subjects designs. Currently, it supports only the most common
  types of statistical analyses and tests: parametric (Welch's and
  Student's t-test), nonparametric (Durbin-Conover test
  Dwass-Steel-Crichtlow-Fligner test), robust (Yuenâ€™s trimmed means
  test), and Bayes Factor (Student's t-test).
