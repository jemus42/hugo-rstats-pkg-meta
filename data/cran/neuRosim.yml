maintainer: Marijke Welvaert
description: The package allows users to generate fMRI time series or 4D data. Some
  high-level functions are created for fast data generation with only a few arguments
  and a diversity of functions to define activation and noise. For more advanced users
  it is possible to use the low-level functions and manipulate the arguments.
