title: Unicode Symbols at the R Prompt
maintainer: Gábor Csárdi
description: |-
  A small subset of Unicode symbols, that are useful
  when building command line applications. They fall back to
  alternatives on terminals that do not support Unicode.
  Many symbols were taken from the 'figures' 'npm' package
  (see <https://github.com/sindresorhus/figures>).
