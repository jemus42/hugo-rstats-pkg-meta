  Cox Models for Time-to-Event Data with Nonparametric Discrete
  Group-Specific Frailties
maintainer: Francesca Gasperoni
description: Functions for fitting Cox proportional hazards models for grouped time-to-event
  data, where the shared group-specific frailties have a discrete nonparametric distribution.
  The methods proposed in the package is described by Gasperoni, F., Ieva, F., Paganoni,
  A. M., Jackson, C. H., Sharples, L. (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy071>. There
  are also functions for simulating from these models, with a nonparametric or a parametric
  baseline hazard function.
