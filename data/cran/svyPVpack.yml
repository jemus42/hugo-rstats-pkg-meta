title: A package for complex surveys including plausible values
maintainer: Manuel Reif
description: This package deals with data which stem from survey designs including
  plausible values. This package has been created to handle data from Large Scale
  Assessments like PISA, PIAAC etc. which use  complex survey designs to draw the
  sample and plausible values to report person related estimates. Various functions/statistics
  (mean, quantile, GLM etc.) are provided to handle this kind of data.
