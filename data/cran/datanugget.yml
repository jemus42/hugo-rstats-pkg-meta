  Creating, refining, and clustering data nuggets.
  Data nuggets reduce a large dataset into a small collection of nuggets of
  data, each containing a center (location), weight (importance), and scale
  (variability) parameter. Data nugget centers are created by choosing
  observations in the dataset which are as equally spaced apart as possible.
  Data nugget weights are created by counting the number observations
  closest to a given data nuggetâ€™s center. We then say the data nugget
  'contains' these observations and the data nugget center is recalculated
  as the mean of these observations. Data nugget scales are created by
  calculating the trace of the covariance matrix of the observations
  contained within a data nugget divided by the dimension of the dataset.
  Data nuggets are refined by 'splitting' data nuggets which have scales or
  shapes (defined as the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues of the
  covariance matrix of the observations contained within the data nugget)
  deemed too large. Data nuggets are clustered by using a weighted form of
  k-means clustering which uses both the centers and weights of data nuggets
  to optimize the clustering assignments.
