title: Quantitative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data
maintainer: Sebastian Gibb
description: |-
  A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
  desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other
  two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly
  used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive
  features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as
  morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive
  non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak
  alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated
  measurements as well as allowing spectra with different
  resolutions.
