title: Easy Data Manipulation, Data Quality and Statistical Checks
maintainer: Akash Jain
description: |-
  Offers useful functions to perform day-to-day data manipulation
  operations, data quality checks and post modelling statistical checks.
  One can effortlessly change class of a number of variables to factor,
  remove duplicate observations from the data, create deciles of a
  variable, perform data quality checks for continuous (integer or numeric),
  categorical (factor) and date variables, and compute goodness of fit
  measures such as auc for statistical models. The functions are consistent
  for objects of class 'data.frame' and 'data.table', which is an enhanced
  'data.frame' implemented in the package 'data.table'.
