  Bayesian Inference on Causal Genetic Variants using Affected
  Sib-Pairs Data
maintainer: Claire Dandine-Roulland
description: |-
  This package allows to make inference on the properties of causal genetic
  variants in linkage disequilibrium with genotyped markers. In a first step,
  we select a subset of variants using a score statistic for affected
  sib-pairs. In a second step, on the selected subset, we make
  inference on causal genetic variants in the considered region.
