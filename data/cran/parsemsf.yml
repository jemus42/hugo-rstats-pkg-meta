title: Parse ThermoFisher MSF Files and Estimate Protein Abundances
maintainer: Benjamin Jack
description: Provides functions for parsing ThermoFisher MSF files produced by Proteome
  Discoverer 1.4.x (see <https://thermofisher.com> for more information). This package
  makes it easy to view individual peptide information, including peak areas, and
  to map peptides to locations within the parent protein sequence. This package also
  estimates protein abundances from peak areas and across multiple technical replicates.
  The author of this package is not affiliated with ThermoFisher Scientific in any
  way.
