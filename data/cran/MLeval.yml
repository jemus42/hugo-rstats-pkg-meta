title: Machine Learning Model Evaluation
maintainer: Christopher R John
description: Straightforward and detailed evaluation of machine learning models. 'MLeval'
  can produce receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall (PR)
  curves, calibration curves, and PR gain curves. 'MLeval' accepts a data frame of
  class probabilities and ground truth labels, or, it can automatically interpret
  the Caret train function results from repeated cross validation, then select the
  best model and analyse the results. 'MLeval' produces a range of evaluation metrics
  with confidence intervals.
