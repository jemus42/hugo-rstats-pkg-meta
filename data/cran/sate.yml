description: |-
  Bundles functions used to analyze the harmfulness of trial errors in criminal trials.
  Functions in the Scientific Analysis of Trial Errors ('SATE') package help users estimate the
  probability that a jury will find a defendant guilty given jurors' preferences for a guilty
  verdict and the uncertainty of that estimate. Users can also compare actual and hypothetical
  trial conditions to conduct harmful error analysis. The relationship between individual jurors'
  verdict preferences and the probability that a jury returns a guilty verdict has been studied
  by Davis (1973) <doi:10.1037/h0033951>; MacCoun & Kerr (1988) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.1.21>,
  and Devine et el. (2001) <doi:10.1037/1076-8971.7.3.622>, among others.
