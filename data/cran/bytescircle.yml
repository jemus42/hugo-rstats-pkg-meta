title: Statistics About Bytes Contained in a File as a Circle Plot
maintainer: Roberto S. Galende
description: |-
  Shows statistics about bytes contained in a file
  as a circle graph of deviations from mean in sigma increments.
  The function can be useful for statistically analyze the content of files
  in a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown, compressed
  and encrypted files should be shown as equally distributed variations with
  a very low CV (sigma/mean), and other types of files can be classified between
  these two categories depending on their text vs binary content, which can be
  useful to quickly determine how information is stored inside them (databases,
  multimedia files, etc).
