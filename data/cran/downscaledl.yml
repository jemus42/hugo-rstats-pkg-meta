title: Downscale of RS Images using Deep Learning
maintainer: Lianfa Li
description: |-
  Downscaling the coarse-resolution remote sensing
  images into fined-resolution images is important for
  preprocessing. This package provides the functions for this
  with high accuracy. Currently, the resautonet is used
  as the deep learning algorithm for downscaling.
  This work was done based on this paper,
  Lianfa Li (2019) <doi:10.3390/rs11111378>.
