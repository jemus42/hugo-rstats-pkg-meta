title: Tools to Work with Google's 'DNS'-over-'HTTPS' ('DoH') API
maintainer: Bob Rudis
description: |-
  To address the problem of insecurity of 'UDP'-based 'DNS' requests,
  Google Public 'DNS' offers 'DNS' resolution over an encrypted 'HTTPS'
  connection. 'DNS'-over-'HTTPS' greatly enhances privacy and security
  between a client and a recursive resolver, and complements 'DNSSEC'
  to provide end-to-end authenticated DNS lookups. Functions that enable
  querying individual requests that bulk requests that return detailed
  responses and bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse
  lookups is also provided. See
  <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https>
  for more information.
