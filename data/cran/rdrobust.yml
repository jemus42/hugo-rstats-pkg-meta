  Robust Data-Driven Statistical Inference in
  Regression-Discontinuity Designs
maintainer: Sebastian Calonico
description: "Regression-discontinuity (RD) designs are quasi-experimental research
  designs popular in social, behavioral and natural sciences. The RD design is usually
  employed to study the (local) causal effect of a treatment, intervention or policy.
  This package provides tools for data-driven graphical and analytical statistical
  inference in RD\tdesigns: rdrobust() to construct local-polynomial point estimators
  and robust confidence intervals for average treatment effects at the \tcutoff in
  Sharp, Fuzzy and Kink RD settings, rdbwselect() to perform bandwidth selection for
  the different procedures implemented, and rdplot() to conduct exploratory data analysis
  (RD plots)."
