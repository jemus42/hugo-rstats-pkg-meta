title: Fitting Mixed Models with Known Covariance Structures
maintainer: Deniz Akdemir
description: The main functions are 'emmreml', and 'emmremlMultiKernel'. 'emmreml'
  solves a mixed model with known covariance structure using the 'EMMA' algorithm.  'emmremlMultiKernel'
  is a wrapper for 'emmreml' to handle multiple random components with known covariance
  structures. The function 'emmremlMultivariate' solves a multivariate gaussian mixed
  model with known covariance structure using the 'ECM' algorithm.
