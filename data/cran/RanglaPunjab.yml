title: Displays Palette of 5 Colors
maintainer: Sonia Ahluwalia
description: |-
  Displays palette of 5 colors based on photos depicting the unique
  and vibrant culture of Punjab in Northern India. Since Punjab translates
  to ``Land of 5 Rivers'' there are 5 colors per palette. If users need
  more than 5 colors, they can merge 2 to 3 palettes to create their own
  color-combination, or they can cherry-pick their own custom colors.
  Users can view up to 3 palettes together. Users can also list all the
  palette choices. And last but not least, users can see the photo that
  inspired a particular palette.
