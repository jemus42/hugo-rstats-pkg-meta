title: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
maintainer: Nicolas Proellochs
description: |-
  Performs model-free reinforcement learning in R. This implementation enables the learning
  of an optimal policy based on sample sequences consisting of states, actions and rewards. In
  addition, it supplies multiple predefined reinforcement learning algorithms, such as experience
  replay. Methodological details can be found in Sutton and Barto (1998) <ISBN:0262039249>.
