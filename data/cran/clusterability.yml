title: Performs Tests for Cluster Tendency of a Data Set
maintainer: Zachariah Neville
description: |-
  Test for cluster tendency (clusterability) of a data set.
  The methods implemented - reducing the data set to a single dimension using principal component analysis or computing
  pairwise distances, and performing a multimodality test like the Dip Test or Silverman's Critical Bandwidth Test -
  are described in Adolfsson, Ackerman, and Brownstein (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2018.10.026>. Such methods can inform whether clustering algorithms
  are appropriate for a data set.
