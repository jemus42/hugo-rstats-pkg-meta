title: Fast Symbolic Multivariate Polynomials
maintainer: Robin K. S. Hankin
description: |-
  Fast manipulation of symbolic multivariate polynomials
  using the 'Map' class of the Standard Template Library.  The package
  uses print and coercion methods from the 'mpoly' package (Kahle 2013,
  "Multivariate polynomials in R".  The R Journal, 5(1):162), but offers
  speed improvements.  It is comparable in speed to the 'spray' package
  for sparse arrays, but retains the symbolic benefits of 'mpoly'.
