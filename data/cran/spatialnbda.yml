title: Performs spatial NBDA in a Bayesian context
maintainer: Glenna Nightingale
description: |-
  Network based diffusion analysis (NBDA) allows inference on
  the asocial and social transmission of information.  This may involve
  the social transmission of a particular behaviour such as tool use, for example.
  For the NBDA, the key parameters estimated are the social effect and baseline rate
  parameters.  The baseline rate parameter gives the rate at which the behaviour
  is first performed (or acquired) asocially amongst the individuals in a given population.
  The social effect parameter quantifies the effect of the social associations amongst
  the individuals on the rate at which each individual first performs or displays
  the behaviour.  Spatial NBDA involves incorporating spatial information in the analysis.
  This is done by incorporating social networks derived from
  spatial point patterns (of the home bases of the individuals under study).  In addition,
  a spatial covariate such as vegetation cover, or slope may be included in the modelling
  process.
