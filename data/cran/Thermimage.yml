version: 4.0.1
title: Thermal Image Analysis
maintainer: Glenn J. Tattersall
description: |-
  A collection of functions and routines for inputting thermal
  image video files, plotting and converting binary raw data into estimates of
  temperature.  First published 2015-03-26.  Written primarily for research purposes
  in biological applications of thermal images.  v1 included the base calculations
  for converting thermal image binary values to temperatures. v2 included additional
  equations for providing heat transfer calculations and an import function for thermal
  image files (v2.2.3 fixed error importing thermal image to windows OS). v3. Added numerous
  functions for converting thermal image, videos, rewriting and exporting.
  v3.1. Added new functions to convert files. v3.2.  Fixed the various functions related to finding frame times.
  v4.0. fixed an error in atmospheric attenuation constants, affecting raw2temp and temp2raw functions.
  Recommend update for use with long distance calculations.
