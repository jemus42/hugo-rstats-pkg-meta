title: Adaptive Smoothing of FMRI Data
maintainer: Max Hughes
description: This package contains R functions for estimating the blood<U+000a>oxygenation
  level dependent (BOLD) effect by using functional<U+000a>Magnetic Resonance Imaging
  (fMRI) data, based on adaptive Gauss<U+000a>Markov random fields, for real as well
  as simulated data. The<U+000a>implemented simulations make use of efficient Markov
  Chain<U+000a>Monte Carlo methods.
