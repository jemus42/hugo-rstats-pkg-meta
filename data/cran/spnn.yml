title: Scale Invariant Probabilistic Neural Networks
maintainer: Romin Ebrahimi
description: Scale invariant version of the original PNN proposed by Specht (1990)
  <doi:10.1016/0893-6080(90)90049-q> with the added functionality of allowing for
  smoothing along multiple dimensions while accounting for covariances within the
  data set. It is written in the R statistical programming language. Given a data
  set with categorical variables, we use this algorithm to estimate the probabilities
  of a new observation vector belonging to a specific category. This type of neural
  network provides the benefits of fast training time relative to backpropagation
  and statistical generalization with only a small set of known observations.
