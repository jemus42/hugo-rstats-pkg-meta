title: Some Helper Functions that Help Create Features from Data
maintainer: Chhavi Choudhury
description: A collection of functions that would help one to build features based
  on external data. Very useful for Data Scientists in data to day work. Many functions
  create features using parallel computation. Since the nitty gritty of parallel computation
  is hidden under the hood, the user need not worry about creating clusters and shutting
  them down.
