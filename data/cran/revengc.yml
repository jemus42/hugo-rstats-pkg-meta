title: Reverse Engineering Summarized Data
maintainer: Samantha Duchscherer
description: Decoupled (e.g. separate averages) and censored (e.g. > 100 species)
  variables are continually reported by many well-established organizations (e.g.
  World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
  World Bank, and various national censuses).  The challenge therefore is to infer
  what the original data could have been given summarized information.  We present
  an R package that reverse engineers decoupled and/or censored count data with two
  main functions.  The cnbinom.pars function estimates the average and dispersion
  parameter of a censored univariate frequency table.  The rec function reverse engineers
  summarized data into an uncensored bivariate table of probabilities.
