version: 1.1.1
title: jSonar Analytics Platform API for R
maintainer: Dylan McCall
description: |-
  This package enables users to access MongoDB by running queries
  and returning their results in R data frames. Usually, data in MongoDB is
  only available in the form of a JSON document. jSonarR uses data
  processing and conversion capabilities in the jSonar Analytics Platform
  and the JSON Studio Gateway (http://www.jsonstudio.com), to convert it to
  a tabular format which is easy to use with existing R packages.
