title: STR Decomposition
maintainer: Alexander Dokumentov
description: 'Methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend decomposition
  procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In some ways, STR is similar to Ridge
  Regression and Robust STR can be related to LASSO. They allow for multiple seasonal
  components, multiple linear covariates with constant, flexible and seasonal influence.
  Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal components and seasonal covariates) can be
  fractional and flexible over time; moreover they can be either strictly periodic
  or have a more complex topology. The methods provide confidence intervals for the
  estimated components. The methods can be used for forecasting.'
