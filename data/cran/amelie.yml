title: Anomaly Detection with Normal Probability Functions
maintainer: Dmitriy Bolotov
description: 'Implements anomaly detection as binary classification for cross-sectional
  data. Uses maximum likelihood estimates and normal probability functions to classify
  observations as anomalous. The method is presented in the following lecture from
  the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/C8IJp/algorithm/>,
  and is also described in: Aleksandar Lazarevic, Levent Ertoz, Vipin Kumar, Aysel
  Ozgur, Jaideep Srivastava (2003) <doi:10.1137/1.9781611972733.3>.'
