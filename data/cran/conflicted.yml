title: An Alternative Conflict Resolution Strategy
maintainer: Hadley Wickham
description: |-
  R's default conflict management system gives the most recently
  loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts,
  particularly when they arise because a package update creates ambiguity
  that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a different approach,
  making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which function
  to use.
