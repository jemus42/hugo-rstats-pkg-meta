title: Estimate Insect Survival from Fluorescence Data
maintainer: Jean-Baptiste Ferdy
description: |-
  Use spectrophotometry measurements performed on insects as a way to infer pathogens
  virulence. Insect movements cause fluctuations in fluorescence signal, and functions are
  provided to estimate when the insect has died as the moment when variance in autofluorescence
  signal drops to zero. The package provides functions to obtain this estimate together with
  functions to import spectrophotometry data from a Biotek microplate reader. Details of the method
  are given in Parthuisot et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/297929>.
