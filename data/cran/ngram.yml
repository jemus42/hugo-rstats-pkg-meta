title: Fast n-Gram 'Tokenization'
maintainer: Drew Schmidt
description: |-
  An n-gram is a sequence of n "words" taken, in order, from a
  body of text.  This is a collection of utilities for creating,
  displaying, summarizing, and "babbling" n-grams.  The
  'tokenization' and "babbling" are handled by very efficient C
  code, which can even be built as its own standalone library.
  The babbler is a simple Markov chain.  The package also offers
  a vignette with complete example 'workflows' and information about
  the utilities offered in the package.
