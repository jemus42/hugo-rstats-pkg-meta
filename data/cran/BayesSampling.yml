title: Bayes Linear Estimators for Finite Population
maintainer: Pedro Soares Figueiredo
description: |-
  Allows the user to apply the Bayes Linear approach to finite population with the Simple Random Sampling - BLE_SRS() - and
  the Stratified Simple Random Sampling design - BLE_SSRS() - (both without replacement) and to the Ratio estimator (using auxiliary
  information) - BLE_Ratio().
  The Bayes linear estimation approach is applied to a general linear regression model for finite population prediction in BLE_Reg()
  and it is also possible to achieve the design based estimators using vague prior distributions.
