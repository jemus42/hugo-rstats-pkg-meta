title: Lightweight Sparklines for a LaTeX Document
maintainer: Boris Veytsman
description: |-
  Sparklines are small plots (about one line of text high),
  made popular by Edward Tufte.  This package is the interface from R
  to the LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer and Dan Luecking
  (<http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines>).  It can work with Sweave or
  knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be used to
  plot vectors, matrices, data frames, time series (in ts or zoo format).
