  of plant names (scientific names, taxonomic names, botanical names) against a static
  copy of the World Flora Online Taxonomic Backbone data that can be downloaded from
  the World Flora Online website. The World Flora Online Taxonomic Backbone is an
  updated version of The Plant List (<http://www.theplantlist.org/>), a working list
  of plant names that has become static since 2013.
