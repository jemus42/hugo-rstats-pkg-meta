title: Inference of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs)
maintainer: Zoumpoulia Dikopoulou
description: Provides a selection of 3 different inference rules (including additionally
  the clamped types of the referred inference rules) and 4 threshold functions in
  order to obtain the inference of the FCM (Fuzzy Cognitive Map). Moreover, the 'fcm'
  package returns a data frame of the concepts' values of each state after the inference
  procedure. Fuzzy cognitive maps were introduced by Kosko (1986) <doi:10.1002/int.4550010405>
  providing ideal causal cognition tools for modeling and simulating dynamic systems.
