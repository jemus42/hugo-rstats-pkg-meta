title: Mutation Models for Pedigree Likelihood Computations
maintainer: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
description: |-
  A collection of functions for modeling mutations in pedigrees with
  marker data, as used e.g. in likelihood computations with microsatellite data.
  Implemented models include proportional and stepwise models, as well as random
  models for experimental work, and custom models allowing the user to apply any
  valid mutation matrix. Allele lumping is done following the lumpability criteria
  of Kemeny and Snell (1976), ISBN:0387901922.
