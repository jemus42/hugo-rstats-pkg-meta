  Tools for Simulating and Plotting Quantities of Interest
  Estimated from Cox Proportional Hazards Models
maintainer: Christopher Gandrud
description: |-
  Simulates and plots quantities of interest (relative
  hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) for linear coefficients,
  multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines, and
  non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival curves from Cox
  Proportional Hazard models. It also simulates and plots marginal effects
  for multiplicative interactions.
