title: A Tidy API for Graph Manipulation
maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen
description: |-
  A graph, while not "tidy" in itself, can be thought of as two tidy
  data frames describing node and edge data respectively. 'tidygraph'
  provides an approach to manipulate these two virtual data frames using the
  API defined in the 'dplyr' package, as well as provides tidy interfaces to
  a lot of common graph algorithms.
