title: Accurate Numerical Derivatives
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Methods for calculating (usually) accurate
  numerical first and second order derivatives. Accurate calculations
  are done using 'Richardson''s' extrapolation or, when applicable, a
  complex step derivative is available. A simple difference
  method is also provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate
  but is much quicker than 'Richardson''s' extrapolation and provides a
  useful cross-check.
  Methods are provided for real scalar and vector valued functions.
