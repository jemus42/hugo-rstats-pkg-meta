maintainer: Tobias Kley
description: |-
  Methods to compute linear h-step ahead prediction coefficients based
  on localised and iterated Yule-Walker estimates and empirical mean squared
  and absolute prediction errors for the resulting predictors. Also, functions
  to compute autocovariances for AR(p) processes, to simulate tvARMA(p,q) time
  series, and to verify an assumption from Kley et al. (2019), Electronic of Statistics,
  forthcoming. Preprint <arXiv:1611.04460>.
