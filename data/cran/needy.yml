description: |-
  needy is a small utility library designed to make testing function
  inputs less difficult. R is a dynamically typed language, but larger
  projects need input checking for scalabity. needy offers a single
  function, require_a( ), which lets you specify the traits an input object
  should have, such as class, size, numerical properties or number of
  parameters, while reducing boilerplate code and aiding debugging.
