title: Narrowest-Over-Threshold Change-Point Detection
maintainer: Rafal Baranowski
description: 'Provides efficient implementation of the Narrowest-Over-Threshold methodology
  for detecting an unknown number of change-points occurring at unknown locations
  in one-dimensional data following deterministic signal + noise model, see  R. Baranowski,
  Y. Chen and P. Fryzlewicz (2019) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12322>. Currently implemented
  scenarios are: piecewise-constant signal, piecewise-constant signal with a heavy-tailed
  noise, piecewise-linear signal, piecewise-quadratic signal, piecewise-constant signal
  and with piecewise-constant variance of the noise.'
