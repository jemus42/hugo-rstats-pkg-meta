  Efficient Estimation of Grouped Survival Models Using the Exact
  Likelihood Function
maintainer: Jiaxing Lin
description: These 'Rcpp'-based functions compute the efficient score statistics for
  grouped time-to-event data (Prentice and Gloeckler, 1978), with the optional inclusion
  of baseline covariates. Functions for estimating the parameter of interest and nuisance
  parameters, including baseline hazards, using maximum likelihood are also provided.
  A parallel set of functions allow for the incorporation of family structure of related
  individuals (e.g., trios). Note that the current implementation of the frailty model
  (Ripatti and Palmgren, 2000) is sensitive to departures from model assumptions,
  and should be considered experimental. For these data, the exact proportional-hazards-model-based
  likelihood is computed by evaluating multiple variable integration. The integration
  is accomplished using the 'Cuba' library (Hahn, 2005), and the source files are
  included in this package. The maximization process is carried out using Brent's
  algorithm, with the C++ code file from John Burkardt and John Denker (Brent, 2002).
