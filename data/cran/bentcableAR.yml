  Bent-Cable Regression for Independent Data or Autoregressive
  Time Series
maintainer: Grace Chiu
description: |2-

  Included are two main interfaces for fitting and diagnosing
  bent-cable regressions for autoregressive time-series data or
  independent data (time series or otherwise): 'bentcable.ar()' and
  'bentcable.dev.plot()'. Some components in the package can also be
  used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable
  (linear-quadratic-linear) generalizes the broken stick
  (linear-linear), which is also handled by this package. Version 0.2
  corrects a glitch in the computation of confidence intervals for the
  CTP. References that were updated from Versions 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 appear
  in Version 0.2.3 and up. Version 0.3.0 improves robustness of the
  error-message producing mechanism. It is the author's intention to
  distribute any future updates via GitHub.
