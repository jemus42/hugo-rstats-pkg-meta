title: Analyse Text Files Created by Emacs' Org mode
maintainer: Yi Tang
description: Provides functionality to process text files created by Emacs' Org mode,
  and decompose the content to the smallest components (headlines, body, tag, clock
  entries etc).  Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor and Org mode is
  for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects.  Allows users to analyze
  org files as data frames in R, e.g., to convieniently group tasks by tag into project
  and calculate total working hours.  Also provides some help functions like search.parent,
  gg.pie (visualise working hours in ggplot2) and tree.headlines (visualise headline
  stricture in tree format) to help user managing their complex org files.
