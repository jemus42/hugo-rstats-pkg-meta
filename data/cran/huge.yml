title: High-Dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation
maintainer: Haoming Jiang
description: |-
  Provides a general framework for
  high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. It integrates
  data preprocessing, neighborhood screening, graph estimation,
  and model selection techniques into a pipeline. In
  preprocessing stage, the nonparanormal(npn) transformation is
  applied to help relax the normality assumption. In the graph
  estimation stage, the graph structure is estimated by
  Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso,
  and both methods can be further accelerated by the lossy
  screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable
  by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data
  analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is
  memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also
  provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation
  thresholding graph estimation. Three
  regularization/thresholding parameter selection methods are
  included in this package: (1)stability approach for
  regularization selection (2) rotation information criterion (3)
  extended Bayesian information criterion which is only available
  for the graphical lasso.
