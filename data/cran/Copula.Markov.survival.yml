title: Copula Markov Model with Dependent Censoring
maintainer: Xin-Wei Huang
description: Perform likelihood estimation and corresponding analysis under the copula-based
  Markov chain model for serially dependent event times with a dependent terminal
  event. A two stage estimation method is applied for estimating model parameters.
  Two copula functions are used for measuring dependence. One is used for modeling
  serial dependence in recurrent event times. The other one is for modeling dependent
  censoring. The baseline hazard functions are modeled by the Weibull distributions.
