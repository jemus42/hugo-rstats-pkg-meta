  A Fast Solver for Parameterized LP Problems, Constrained L1
  Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation and
  Dantzig Selector
maintainer: Haotian Pang
description: |-
  Provides a method of recovering the precision matrix efficiently
  and solving for the dantzig selector by applying the parametric
  simplex method.  The computation is based on a linear optimization
  solver. It also contains a generic LP solver and a parameterized LP
  solver using parametric simplex method.
