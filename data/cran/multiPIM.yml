title: Variable Importance Analysis with Population Intervention Models
maintainer: Stephan Ritter
description: Performs variable importance analysis using a causal inference approach.
  This is done by fitting Population Intervention Models. The default is to use a
  Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (TMLE). The other available estimators are
  Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (IPCW), Double-Robust IPCW (DR-IPCW),
  and Graphical Computation (G-COMP) estimators. Inference can be obtained from the
  influence curve (plug-in) or by bootstrapping.
