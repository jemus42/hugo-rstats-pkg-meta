title: Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Made Easy
maintainer: Vincent Calcagno
description: |-
  Automated model selection and model-averaging. Provides a
  wrapper for glm and other functions, automatically generating
  all possible models (under constraints set by the user) with
  the specified response and explanatory variables, and finding
  the best models in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC,
  AICc or BIC). Can handle very large numbers of candidate
  models. Features a Genetic Algorithm to find the best models
  when an exhaustive screening of the candidates is not feasible.
