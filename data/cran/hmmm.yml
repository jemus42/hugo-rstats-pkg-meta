title: Hierarchical Multinomial Marginal Models
maintainer: Colombi Roberto
description: |-
  Functions for specifying and fitting marginal models for contingency tables proposed
  by Bergsma and Rudas (2002) here called hierarchical multinomial marginal models (hmmm) and their extensions presented by Bartolucci et al.
  (2007); multinomial Poisson homogeneous (mph) models and homogeneous linear predictor (hlp) models for contingency
  tables proposed by Lang (2004) and (2005); hidden Markov models where the distribution of the observed variables
  is described by a marginal model.
  Inequality constraints on the parameters are allowed and can be tested.
