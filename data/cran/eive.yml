  An Algorithm for Reducing Errors-in-Variable Bias in Simple
  Linear Regression
maintainer: Mehmet Hakan Satman
description: Performs a compact genetic algorithm search to reduce errors-in-variables
  bias in linear regression. The algorithm estimates the regression parameters with
  lower biases and higher variances but mean-square errors (MSEs) are reduced.
