  "Hit and Run" and "Shake and Bake" for Sampling Uniformly from
  Convex Shapes
maintainer: Gert van Valkenhoef
description: The "Hit and Run" Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling uniformly
  from convex shapes defined by linear constraints, and the "Shake and Bake" method
  for sampling from the boundary of such shapes. Includes specialized functions for
  sampling normalized weights with arbitrary linear constraints.
