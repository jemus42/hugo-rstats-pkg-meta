title: Summarise a Distribution Through Coloured Intervals
maintainer: Jason Hilton
description: |-
  Implements the functionality of the 'fanplot' package as 'geoms'
  for 'ggplot2'. Designed for summarising MCMC samples from a posterior
  distribution, where a visualisation is desired for several values of a
  continuous covariate. Increasing posterior intervals of the sampled quantity
  are mapped to a continuous colour scale.
