  Approximate Bayesian Computations for Phylogenetic Comparative
  Methods
maintainer: Krzysztof Bartoszek
description: Fits by ABC, the parameters of a stochastic process modelling the phylogeny
  and evolution of a suite of traits following the tree. The user may define an arbitrary
  Markov process for the trait and phylogeny. Importantly, trait-dependent speciation
  models are handled and fitted to data. See K. Bartoszek, P. Lio' (2019) <10.5506/APhysPolBSupp.12.25>.
  The suggested geiger package can be obtained from CRAN's archive <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/geiger/>,
  suggested to take latest version. Otherwise its required code is present in the
  pcmabc package. The suggested distory package can be obtained from CRAN's archive
  <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/distory/>, suggested to take latest
  version. Both distory and geiger are orphaned at the moment.
