  Dynamics (PSID)
maintainer: Brian Aronson
description: Provides various functions for reading and preparing the Panel Study
  of Income Dynamics (PSID) for longitudinal analysis, including functions that read
  the PSID's fixed width format files directly into R, rename all of the PSID's longitudinal
  variables so that recurring variables have consistent names across years, simplify
  assembling longitudinal datasets from cross sections of the PSID Family Files, and
  export the resulting PSID files into file formats common among other statistical
  programming languages ('SAS', 'STATA', and 'SPSS').
