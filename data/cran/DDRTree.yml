title: Learning Principal Graphs with DDRTree
maintainer: Xiaojie Qiu
description: Provides an implementation of the framework of reversed graph embedding
  (RGE) which projects data into a reduced dimensional space while constructs a principal
  tree which passes through the middle of the data simultaneously. DDRTree shows superiority
  to alternatives (Wishbone, DPT) for inferring the ordering as well as the intrinsic
  structure of the single cell genomics data. In general, it could be used to reconstruct
  the temporal progression as well as bifurcation structure of any datatype.
