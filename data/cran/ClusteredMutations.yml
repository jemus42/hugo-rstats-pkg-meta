title: Location and Visualization of Clustered Somatic Mutations
maintainer: David Lora
description: Identification and visualization of groups of closely spaced mutations
  in the DNA sequence of cancer genome. The extremely mutated zones are searched in
  the symmetric dissimilarity matrix using the anti-Robinson matrix properties. Different
  data sets are obtained to describe and plot the clustered mutations information.
