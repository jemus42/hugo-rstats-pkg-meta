title: Learning Graphs from Data via Spectral Constraints
maintainer: Ze Vinicius
description: |-
  In the era of big data and hyperconnectivity, learning
  high-dimensional structures such as graphs from data has become a prominent
  task in machine learning and has found applications in many fields such as
  finance, health care, and networks. 'spectralGraphTopology' is an open source,
  documented, and well-tested R package for learning graphs from data. It
  provides implementations of state of the art algorithms such as Combinatorial
  Graph Laplacian Learning (CGL), Spectral Graph Learning (SGL), Graph Estimation
  based on Majorization-Minimization (GLE-MM), and Graph Estimation based on
  Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (GLE-ADMM). In addition, graph
  learning has been widely employed for clustering, where specific algorithms
  are available in the literature. To this end, we provide an implementation of
  the Constrained Laplacian Rank (CLR) algorithm.
