title: Estimation of Entropy and Related Quantities
maintainer: Michael Grabchak
description: Contains methods for the estimation of Shannon's entropy, variants of
  Renyi's entropy, mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and generalized
  Simpson's indices. The estimators used have a bias that decays exponentially fast.
