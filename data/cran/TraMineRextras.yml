version: 0.6.0
title: TraMineR Extension
maintainer: Gilbert Ritschard
description: Collection of ancillary functions and utilities to be used in conjunction
  with the 'TraMineR' package for sequence data exploration. Most of the functions
  are in test phase, lack systematic consistency check of the arguments and are subject
  to changes. Once fully checked, some of the functions of this collection could be
  included in a next release of 'TraMineR'.
