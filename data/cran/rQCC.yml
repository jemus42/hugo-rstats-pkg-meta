title: Robust Quality Control Chart
maintainer: Chanseok Park
description: Constructs robust quality control chart based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann
  estimator (location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos estimator
  (scale). These estimators are all unbiased with a sample of finite size. For more
  details, see Park, Kim and Wang (2020) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114>. This
  work was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)
