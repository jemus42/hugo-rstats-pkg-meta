title: Selective k-Means
maintainer: Guang Yang
description: |-
  Algorithms for solving selective k-means problem,
  which is defined as finding k rows in an m x n matrix such that
  the sum of each column minimal is minimized.
  In the scenario when m == n and each cell value in matrix is a
  valid distance metric, this is equivalent to a k-means problem.
  The selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the sense
  that it is possible to have m != n, often the case m < n which
  implies the search is limited within a small subset of rows.
  Also, the selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the
  sense that the instance in row set can be instance not seen in
  the column set, e.g., select 2 from 3 internet service provider
  (row) for 5 houses (column) such that minimize the overall cost
  (cell value) - overall cost is the sum of the column minimal of
  the selected 2 service provider.
