title: Detection of Fixations in Eye-Tracking Data
maintainer: Titus von der Malsburg
description: |-
  Functions for detecting eye fixations in raw eye-tracking
  data.  The detection is done using a velocity-based algorithm for
  saccade detection proposed by Ralf Engbert and Reinhold Kliegl in
  2003.  The algorithm labels segments as saccades when the velocity of
  the eye movement exceeds a certain threshold.  Anything between two
  saccades is considered a fixation.  Thus the algorithm is not
  appropriate for data containing episodes of smooth pursuit eye
  movements.
