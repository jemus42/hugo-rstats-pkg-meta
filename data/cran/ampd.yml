  An Algorithm for Automatic Peak Detection in Noisy Periodic and
  Quasi-Periodic Signals
maintainer: Oliver Sieber
description: |-
  A method for automatic detection of peaks in noisy periodic and quasi-periodic signals. This method, called automatic multiscale-based peak detection (AMPD), is based on the calculation and analysis of the local maxima scalogram, a matrix comprising the scale-dependent occurrences of local maxima.
