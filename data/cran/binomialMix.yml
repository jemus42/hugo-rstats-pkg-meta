title: Mixture Models for Binomial and Longitudinal Data
maintainer: Faustine Bousquet
description: Provides a clustering method of non-gaussian longitudinal data with a
  mixture of generalized linear models. The longitudinal data should be defined as
  repeated observations for each individual. The number of observations for each individual
  can be different. In runEM(), an expectation-maximization algorithm is developed
  for both binomial and longitudinal data mixture model.
