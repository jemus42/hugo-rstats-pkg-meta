description: |2-

  Provides both parametric and non-parametric estimates of the
  correlates of some desired
  outcome (e.g. test scores, income) using a new method proposed by
  Danieli, Devi and Fryer (2019). This method relaxes the assumption
  that one can alter individual characteristics in any way the data
  suggest is optimal, and so can be used anytime one wants to use observational
  data to better optimize social experiments designed to increase some desired
  outcome.
