title: Rcpp-Based Truncated Normal Distribution RNG and Family
maintainer: Jonathan Olmsted
description: |-
  R-level and C++-level functionality
  to generate random deviates from and calculate moments of a
  Truncated Normal distribution using the algorithm of Robert (1995) <DOI:10.1007/BF00143942>.
  In addition to RNG, functions for calculating moments, densities,
  and entropies are provided at both levels.
