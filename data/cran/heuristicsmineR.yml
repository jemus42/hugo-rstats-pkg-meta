title: Discovery of Process Models with the Heuristics Miner
maintainer: Felix Mannhardt
description: |-
  Provides the heuristics miner algorithm for process discovery
  as proposed by Weijters et al. (2011) <doi:10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949453>. The
  algorithm builds a causal net from an event log created with the 'bupaR'
  package. Event logs are a set of ordered sequences of events for which
  'bupaR' provides the S3 class eventlog(). The discovered causal nets
  can be visualised as 'htmlwidgets' and it is possible to annotate them with
  the occurrence frequency or processing and waiting time of process
  activities.
