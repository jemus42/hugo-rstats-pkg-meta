title: Calculate Water Vapor Measures from Temperature and Dew Point
maintainer: Jun Cai
description: Vapor pressure, relative humidity, absolute humidity, specific humidity,
  and mixing ratio are commonly used water vapor measures in meteorology. This R package
  provides functions for calculating saturation vapor pressure (hPa), partial water
  vapor pressure (Pa), relative humidity (%), absolute humidity (kg/m^3), specific
  humidity (kg/kg), and mixing ratio (kg/kg) from temperature (K) and dew point (K).
  Conversion functions between humidity measures are also provided.
