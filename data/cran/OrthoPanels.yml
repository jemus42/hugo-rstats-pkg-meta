  Dynamic Panel Models with Orthogonal Reparameterization of Fixed
  Effects
maintainer: Mark Pickup
description: |-
  Implements the orthogonal reparameterization
  approach recommended by Lancaster (2002) to estimate dynamic panel
  models with fixed effects (and optionally: panel specific
  intercepts). The approach uses a likelihood-based estimator and
  produces estimates that are asymptotically unbiased as N goes to
  infinity, with a T as low as 2.
