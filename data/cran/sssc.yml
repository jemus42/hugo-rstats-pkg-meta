title: Same Species Sample Contamination Detection
maintainer: Tao Jiang
description: |-
  Imports Variant Calling Format file into R. It can detect
  whether a sample contains contaminant from the same species.
  In the first stage of the approach, a change-point detection
  method is used to identify copy number variations for filtering.
  Next, features are extracted from the data for a support vector
  machine model. For log-likelihood calculation, the deviation
  parameter is estimated by maximum likelihood method. Using
  a radial basis function kernel support vector machine, the
  contamination of a sample can be detected.
