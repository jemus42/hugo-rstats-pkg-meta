  Sample Size Calculation for High Dimensional Classification
  Study
maintainer: Brisa N. Sanchez
description: Determine the sample size requirement to achieve the target probability
  of correct classification (PCC) for studies employing high-dimensional features.  The
  package implements functions to 1) determine the asymptotic feasibility of the classification
  problem; 2) compute the upper bounds of the PCC for any linear classifier; 3) estimate
  the PCC of three design methods given design assumptions; 4) determine the sample
  size requirement to achieve the target PCC for three design methods.
