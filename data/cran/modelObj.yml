title: A Model Object Framework for Regression Analysis
maintainer: Shannon T. Holloway
description: A utility library to facilitate the generalization of statistical methods
  built on a regression framework. Package developers can use 'modelObj' methods to
  initiate a regression analysis without concern for the details of the regression
  model and the method to be used to obtain parameter estimates. The specifics of
  the regression step are left to the user to define when calling the function. The
  user of a function developed within the 'modelObj' framework creates as input a
  'modelObj' that contains the model and the R methods to be used to obtain parameter
  estimates and to obtain predictions.  In this way, a user can easily go from linear
  to non-linear models within the same package.
