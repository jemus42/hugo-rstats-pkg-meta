title: Bootstrap 2 Web Components for Use with Shiny
maintainer: Winston Chang
description: |-
  Provides Bootstrap 2 web components for use with the Shiny
  package. With versions of Shiny prior to 0.11, these Bootstrap 2 components
  were included as part of the package. Later versions of Shiny include
  Bootstrap 3, so the Bootstrap 2 components have been moved into this
  package for those uses who rely on features specific to Bootstrap 2.
