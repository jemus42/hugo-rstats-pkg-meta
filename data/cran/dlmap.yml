title: Detection Localization Mapping for QTL
maintainer: Emma Huang
description: QTL mapping in a mixed model framework with separate<U+000a>detection
  and localization stages. The first stage detects the<U+000a>number of QTL on each
  chromosome based on the genetic variation<U+000a>due to grouped markers on the chromosome;
  the second stage uses<U+000a>this information to determine the most likely QTL positions.<U+000a>The
  mixed model can accommodate general fixed and random<U+000a>effects, including spatial
  effects in field trials and pedigree<U+000a>effects. Applicable to backcrosses,
  doubled haploids,<U+000a>recombinant inbred lines, F2 intercrosses, and association<U+000a>mapping
  populations.
