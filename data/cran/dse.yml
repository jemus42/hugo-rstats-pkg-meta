title: Dynamic Systems Estimation (Time Series Package)
maintainer: Paul Gilbert
description: |-
  Tools for multivariate, linear, time-invariant,
  time series models. This includes ARMA and state-space representations,
  and methods for converting between them. It also includes simulation
  methods and several estimation functions. The package has functions
  for looking at model roots, stability, and forecasts at different
  horizons. The ARMA model representation is general, so that VAR, VARX,
  ARIMA, ARMAX, ARIMAX can all be considered to be special cases. Kalman
  filter and smoother estimates can be obtained from the state space
  model, and state-space model reduction techniques are implemented.
  An introduction and User's Guide is available in a vignette.
