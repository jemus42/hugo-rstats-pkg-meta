title: Network of Differential Equations
maintainer: Dirk Surmann
description: |-
  Simulates a network of ordinary differential equations of order
  two. The package provides an easy interface to construct networks. In addition
  you are able to define different external triggers to manipulate the trajectory.
  The method is described by Surmann, Ligges, and Weihs (2014) <doi:10.1109/ENERGYCON.2014.6850482>.
