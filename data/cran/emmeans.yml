title: Estimated Marginal Means, aka Least-Squares Means
maintainer: Russell Lenth
description: |-
  Obtain estimated marginal means (EMMs) for many linear, generalized
  linear, and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of EMMs,
  trends, and comparisons of slopes. Plots and other displays.
  Least-squares means are discussed, and the term "estimated marginal means"
  is suggested, in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) Population marginal means
  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means, The American
  Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>.
