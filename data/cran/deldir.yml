maintainer: Rolf Turner
description: |-
  Calculates the Delaunay triangulation and the Dirichlet
  or Voronoi tessellation (with respect to the entire plane) of
  a planar point set. Plots triangulations and tessellations in
  various ways.  Clips tessellations to sub-windows. Calculates
  perimeters of tessellations.  Summarises information about the
  tiles of the tessellation.
