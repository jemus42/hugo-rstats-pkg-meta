maintainer: M. Helena Gonçalves
description: |-
  Performs logistic regression for binary longitudinal
  data, allowing for serial dependence among observations from a given
  individual and a random intercept term. Estimation is via maximization
  of the exact likelihood of a suitably defined model. Missing values and
  unbalanced data are allowed, with some restrictions.
