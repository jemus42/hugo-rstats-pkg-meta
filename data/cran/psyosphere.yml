title: Analyse GPS Data
maintainer: Benjamin Ziepert
description: |-
  Analyse location data such as latitude,
  longitude, and elevation. Based on spherical trigonometry, variables such as
  speed, bearing, and distances can be calculated from moment to moment,
  depending on the sampling frequency of the equipment used, and independent
  of scale. Additionally, the package can plot tracks, coordinates, and shapes
  on maps, and sub-tracks can be selected with point-in-polygon or other
  techniques. The package is optimized to support behavioural science
  experiments with multiple tracks. It can detect and clean up errors in the
  data, and resulting data can be exported to be analysed in statistical
  software or geographic information systems (GIS).
