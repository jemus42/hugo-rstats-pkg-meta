title: Quantitative Support of Decision Making under Uncertainty
maintainer: Eike Luedeling
description: |-
  Supporting the quantitative analysis of binary welfare based
  decision making processes using Monte Carlo simulations. Decision support
  is given on two levels: (i) The actual decision level is to choose between
  two alternatives under probabilistic uncertainty. This package calculates
  the optimal decision based on maximizing expected welfare. (ii) The meta
  decision level is to allocate resources to reduce the uncertainty in the
  underlying decision problem, i.e to increase the current information to
  improve the actual decision making process. This problem is dealt with
  using the Value of Information Analysis. The Expected Value of
  Information for arbitrary prospective estimates can be calculated as
  well as Individual Expected Value of Perfect Information.
  The probabilistic calculations are done via Monte Carlo
  simulations. This Monte Carlo functionality can be used on its own.
