  Calculate Ad Hoc Distance Thresholds for DNA Barcoding
  Identification
maintainer: Gontran Sonet
description: Two functions to calculate intra- and interspecific pairwise distances,
  evaluate DNA barcoding identification error and calculate an ad hoc distance threshold
  for each particular reference library of DNA barcodes. Specimen identification at
  this ad hoc distance threshold (using the best close match method) will produce
  identifications with an estimated relative error probability that can be fixed by
  the user (e.g. 5%).
