  Import Articles from 'LexisNexis' Using the 'tm' Text Mining
  Framework
maintainer: Milan Bouchet-Valat
description: |-
  Provides a 'tm' Source to create corpora from
  articles exported from the 'LexisNexis' content provider as
  HTML files. It is able to read both text content and meta-data
  information (including source, date, title, author and pages).
  Note that the file format is highly unstable: there is no warranty
  that this package will work for your corpus, and you may have
  to adjust the code to adapt it to your particular format.
