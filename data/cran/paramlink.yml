title: Parametric Linkage and Other Pedigree Analysis in R
maintainer: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
description: A suite of tools for analysing pedigrees with marker data, including
  parametric linkage analysis, forensic computations, relatedness analysis and marker
  simulations. The core of the package is an implementation of the Elston-Stewart
  algorithm for pedigree likelihoods, extended to allow mutations as well as complex
  inbreeding. Features for linkage analysis include singlepoint LOD scores, power
  analysis, and multipoint analysis (the latter through a wrapper to the 'MERLIN'
  software). Forensic applications include exclusion probabilities, genotype distributions
  and conditional simulations. Data from the 'Familias' software can be imported and
  analysed in 'paramlink'. Finally, 'paramlink' offers many utility functions for
  creating, manipulating and plotting pedigrees with or without marker data (the actual
  plotting is done by the 'kinship2' package).
